program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.06.2009 steinmeier tells social democrats to pull together ahead of national elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is hoping to be able to break away from their grand coalition with the conservatives germany 's top social democrat , frank-walter steinmeier , has vowed to speak up for working germans as he tried to reignite his party 's campaign hopes ahead of september 's general election . steinmeier , who is trying to unseat chancellor angela merkel in the election , used the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- congress on sunday to attack his conservative rivals from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .
meanwhile , a spokesperson from hamas slammed netanyahu 's speech , saying it reflected a " racist and extremist ideology . " sje / reuters / ap / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .

franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .

" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems .

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .
meanwhile , a spokesperson from hamas slammed netanyahu 's speech , saying it reflected a " racist and extremist ideology . " sje / reuters / ap / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .
meanwhile , a spokesperson from hamas slammed netanyahu 's speech , saying it reflected a " racist and extremist ideology . " sje / reuters / ap / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .
meanwhile , a spokesperson from hamas slammed netanyahu 's speech , saying it reflected a " racist and extremist ideology . " sje / reuters / ap / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .

steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

" so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .

franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

" the withdrawals that israel has carried out in the past have not changed this reality . "
" the territory in palestinian hands must be demilitarised - in other words , without an army , without control of airspace and with effective security safeguards . "
" if we receive this ... demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by israel , and if the palestinians recognise israel as the nation state of the jewish people , we will be prepared for a true peace agreement , to reach a solution of a demilitarised palestinian state alongside the jewish state , " he said .
hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas -lrb- right -rrb- and saeb erekat were unimpressed chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat agreed , saying netanyahu 's speech had unilaterally ended all negotiations by excluding key issues , such as security , from future talks .
" he will have to wait 1,000 years before he finds one palestinian who will go along with him with this feeble state , " erekat said .
meanwhile , a spokesperson from hamas slammed netanyahu 's speech , saying it reflected a " racist and extremist ideology . " sje / reuters / ap / dpa / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hard line on hamas netanyahu called on the leadership of the palestinian authority to defeat hamas islamists who seized control of the gaza strip two years ago and continue to reject interim peace accords .
" they must decide between the way of peace and the way of hamas , " he said .
" the palestinian authority must impose law and order ... and overcome hamas .
israel will not negotiate with terrorists trying to destroy it . "
netanyahu stressed that the palestinian refugee problem must be resolved outside israeli borders and that jerusalem must remain the united capital of israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu says west bank settlements need some room to grow on the issue of expansion in the west bank , the israeli leader said jewish settlers should be given room for " natural growth " .
" we have no intention of building new settlements or of expropriating land for new settlements , " he said .
" but , there is a need to allow settlers to lead normal lives , to allow mothers and fathers to raise their children like all families around the world . "
president barack obama said netanyahu 's speech was " an important step forward " and accepted the remarks as an endorsement of his goal of a two-state solution to the palestinian and israeli conflict .
in france , foreign minister bernard kouchner said , " i can only welcome the prospect of a palestinian state outlined by the new israeli prime minister . "
angry reactions a spokesman for palestinian president mahmoud abbas criticized the israeli prime minister for " sabotaging " peace efforts with his demand that jerusalem be the undivided capital of israel and his refusal to allow palestinian refugees into israel .
" netanyahu 's remarks have sabotaged all initiatives , paralysed all efforts being made and challenged the palestinian , arab and american positions , " said nabil abu rdainah .
" this will not lead to complete and just peace . "

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.06.2009 steinmeier tells social democrats to pull together ahead of national elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is hoping to be able to break away from their grand coalition with the conservatives germany 's top social democrat , frank-walter steinmeier , has vowed to speak up for working germans as he tried to reignite his party 's campaign hopes ahead of september 's general election . steinmeier , who is trying to unseat chancellor angela merkel in the election , used the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- congress on sunday to attack his conservative rivals from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .

steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .

" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems .

" from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 14.06.2009 steinmeier tells social democrats to pull together ahead of national elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd is hoping to be able to break away from their grand coalition with the conservatives germany 's top social democrat , frank-walter steinmeier , has vowed to speak up for working germans as he tried to reignite his party 's campaign hopes ahead of september 's general election . steinmeier , who is trying to unseat chancellor angela merkel in the election , used the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- congress on sunday to attack his conservative rivals from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .

" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .

" from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .

franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the berlin government has not confirmed the news . a local official quoted on the yemeni defence ministry 's website said the group was seized in the restive sa 'dah region in the northwest by rebels who have been fighting the government in sana 'a for five years .
the german group includes a couple , three children and two women nurses , according to the yemeni defence ministry official .
a british engineer and a female south korean teacher are also among those kidnapped .
they belong to an international organization which has been working for over three decades at a hospital in sa 'dah , some 240 kilometres north of the capital , according to the official .
however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

however , he did not say when the group was kidnapped .
a spokesman for the foreign office in berlin simply said the german embassy in sana 'a was in close contact with local authorities .
no one has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping so far .
however , local officials said the foreigners were taken hostage by members of the huthi zaidi rebel group , which has been fighting the government since 2004 .
no peace despite qatari-brokered deal the insurgents are known as huthis after their late commander hussein badr eddin al-huthi .
he was killed by the army about five years ago .
the sana 'a government and huthi rebels signed a qatari-brokered peace deal last june but there has been repeated wrangling about its implementation .
kidnappings of foreigners are a frequent occurrence in yemen as tribesmen often use them to twist the government 's arm in local disputes .
more than 200 foreigners have been abducted over the past 15 years .
according to reports , in all the documented cases , the hostages have been freed unharmed , except for three britons and an australian seized by islamist militants in december 1998 .
they were killed when security forces stormed the kidnappers ' hideout .
in april this year , a dutch couple were held for two weeks by tribesmen to pressure the government to pay compensation for an incident involving a tribal chief and security forces .
the country has also seen a spate of attacks on foreign and government targets , most recently suicide bombings against south korean tourists claimed by the local branch of al-qaeda. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

" one reason they should n't win a majority is that the ideology that got us into this crisis is definitely not the answer to the crisis , " steinmeier told the crowd of 500 delegates in berlin .
" i take the worries of the people seriously .
i know damned well what 's up , " he said .
" we 'll fight for the woman shop assistant and the building worker .
but at the same time , we 'll remain the party of the new centrism . "
steinmeier said the spd needs to show workers what they might suffer if a centre-right alliance took over from the current grand coalition between his party and the cdu .
the spd delegates took less then five hours to adopt a 60-page election manifesto that calls for a nationwide minimum wage of 7.50 euros , reduced taxes for low-wage earners and the introduction of a solidarity tax for the rich .
speaker after speaker told the congress that the spd must not be discouraged by dismal polls and the party 's poor showing at last weekend 's european parliamentary election .
the german vice-chancellor and foreign minister who hopes to topple chancellor angela merkel , urged all spd members to ensure victory for the social democrats in september 's general elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier and muentefering were all smiles at the party convention last october looking back on 2008 steinmeier 's bid for germany 's top job started so promisingly back in october 2008 , when party members came together for their convention in berlin to bury the hatchet and elect a new leader .
franz muenterfering was chosen as the new head and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was put forward as their candidate for chancellor .
" if you have faith , then i am ready , " steinmeier called out to the celebrating delegates .
as the convention came to a close , steinmeier summed up what the new change of leadership would mean .
" hope and confidence are back .
this will be a day of new departures .
we believe in ourselves again , which makes us strong and our opponents will recognize that . "
one debacle after another bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd had high hopes for presidential candidate schwan however , that confidence was soon put to the test .
in january of this year , elections that should have easily been won by the spd ended disastrously when christian democrat roland koch made a triumphant return to his post as premier of the state of hesse .
in addition , the spd 's candidate for president , gesine schwan , was defeated by incumbent horst koehler , who was supported by the cdu and their preferred coalition partners , the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
less than one month later , european elections handed the spd its worst defeat in party history : only 20 percent of the vote. sje / rb / bm / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

the eight-nation soccer tournament is being watched closely as a test to see if the country is ready to host the world cup in 2010 . south african president jacob zuma officially kicked off the confederations cup in johannesburg telling south africa and the wrld that the start of the tournament was historic for the entire continent .
" today this indeed is a great day for africa and for south africa , " he told the cheering crowd .
" therefore i would like to declare the 2009 fifa confederations cup - opened ! "
fifa president sepp blatter joined zuma in his optimism , telling thousands of fans that fifa wanted to thank south africa for the preparations for the world cup .
" dear friends , fifa is committed to africa .
brothers and sisters , i would like to say a lot of thanks to the people of south africa , to the african continent , who have organized this competition , " blatter told the cheering crowds . the first match of the tournament saw asian champions iraq put a damper on south africa 's opening party , holding the hosts to a 0-0 draw .
in the second match spain beat new zealand 5-0 . a dress rehearsal for the 2010 world cup both on and off the pitch , all the major players in south africa have gone the extra mile in order to ensure that the confederations cup proves successful over the next two weeks . the local organising committee of the fifa world cup , the south african football association , the government and members of the public are generally enthusiastic and confident .
they all seem to want to demonstrate to the world that the country will not only pull off an outstanding confederations cup but that south africa is ready for the world cup next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opening ceremony was held in the johannesburg stadium one issue of concern - both to visitors and to south african leaders - is safety and security during the two events .
the south african police say they have deployed more than 8,000 police officers at cup venues , major airports and hotels to provide security for visiting and local football fans .
" as far as security is concerned it ’ s all going according to plan , " says the national spokesperson for the police , senior superintendent vishnu naidoo .
" we ’ re working very , very closely with various other government departments , with the south african national defence force , traffic , metro and all other government departments that form part of the national joint operational structure . "
the local organising committee of the fifa world cup is equally confident that all necessary security measures have been put in place to ensure that no visitors would have any problems . " we are very confident that the event , particularly the confederations cup , will be very secure and of course also the world cup itself will be very secure , " says rich mkhondo , chief media spokesperson for the local organising committee of fifa . bildunterschrift : fans are looking forward to the action on the pitch " we ’ re going to have 12,000 security officers who are going to be on duty during the confederations cup .
everything is in place when it comes to security .
the spectators , the visitors and the teams are going to be secure , " he adds . the eight stadiums where the world cup matches will be played are reportedly almost finished - with four of them already being put to use for confederations cup matches in johannesburg , pretoria , bloemfontein and rustenburg . " from the stadium construction side of it , we are hoping that all stadiums will be ready by the end of november come december , " says muhammad mubarak , deputy president of the south african football association . " so we are very optimistic that all the infrastructure will be in place .
and the infrastructure that has been developed so far will be good for the country - not only for the world cup but for events after the world cup as well . " the eight teams participating in the confederations cup are brazil , spain , italy , iraq , egypt , united states , new zealand and the hosts south africa . although some international media have concentrated on the difficulties that south africa faces in hosting both the confederations cup and the world cup , most south africans feel confident that the problems can be overcome . officials point out that the country has successfully hosted international rugby , cricket and football tournaments since 1994 without any serious complications .

he blamed " foreign media " for instigating a " full-fledged fight against our people " .
" nearly 40 million people took part in a totally free election , " he said .
bbc iranian affairs analyst sadeq saba says the margin of the win was so wide that it made a lot of people suspicious .
he says given the high turnout , it was expected that mr mousavi would have won at least half of the votes .
jon leyne reporting from tehran president mahmoud ahmadinejad has always seen himself as more than just a politician .

at home , many iranians will fear a clampdown on society and cultural life .
mr ahmadinejad knows that many even within the political establishment oppose him , which might increase his tendency towards authoritarianism .

some of the protesters in tehran wore mr mousavi 's campaign colour of green and chanted " down with the dictator " , news agencies report .
four police motorbikes were set on fire near the interior ministry , where votes had been counted , our correspondent says .
one bbc news website reader , xenia , went to vanak square in tehran to express anger and said police fired plastic bullets .
" they fired tear gas to scare us away , but it would only be temporarily .
we would hide in some corner and then re-emerge angrier than ever . "
the bbc 's jon leyne in tehran says clashes continued late into saturday evening and there are reports that a number of reformist leaders have been arrested .

mr mousavi earlier said the election was a " charade " .
" i personally strongly protest the many obvious violations and i 'm warning i will not surrender to this dangerous charade .
" the result of such performance by some officials will jeopardise the pillars of the islamic republic and will establish tyranny . "
iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who wields ultimate power , urged all iranians " including yesterday 's competitors " to support the re-elected president .
he described the count as a " real celebration " , praised the high turnout of 85 % and called for calm .
" enemies may want to spoil the sweetness of this event ... with some kind of ill-intentioned provocations , " the ayatollah said .
mr mousavi had been hoping to prevent mr ahmadinejad winning more than 50 % of the vote , in order to force a run-off election .
our correspondent , jon leyne , says the result has been greeted with surprise and with deep scepticism by many iranians .
the figures , if they are to be believed , show mr ahmadinejad winning strongly even in the heartland of mr mousavi .
our correspondent says mr ahmadinejad will feel emboldened in his global vision - one that foresees the death of capitalism - while at home many iranians will fear a clampdown on society and cultural life .
surge of interest there had been a surge of interest in iran 's presidential election , with unprecedented live television debates between the candidates and rallies attended by thousands .
there were long queues at polling stations on friday , with turnout reaching 85 % .
four candidates contested the election , with mohsen razai and mehdi karroubi only registering about 1 % of the vote each .
iran is ruled under a system known as velayat-e faqih , or " rule by the supreme jurist " , who is currently ayatollah ali khamenei .
it was adopted by an overwhelming majority in 1979 following the islamic revolution which overthrew the autocratic western-backed shah .
but the constitution also stipulates that the people are the source of power and the country holds phased presidential and parliamentary elections every four years .
all candidates are vetted by the powerful conservative-controlled guardian council , which also has the power to veto legislation it deems inconsistent with revolutionary principles .

surge of interest there had been a surge of interest in iran 's presidential election , with unprecedented live television debates between the candidates and rallies attended by thousands .
there were long queues at polling stations on friday , with turnout reaching 85 % .
four candidates contested the election , with mohsen razai and mehdi karroubi only registering about 1 % of the vote each .
iran is ruled under a system known as velayat-e faqih , or " rule by the supreme jurist " , who is currently ayatollah ali khamenei .
it was adopted by an overwhelming majority in 1979 following the islamic revolution which overthrew the autocratic western-backed shah .
but the constitution also stipulates that the people are the source of power and the country holds phased presidential and parliamentary elections every four years .
all candidates are vetted by the powerful conservative-controlled guardian council , which also has the power to veto legislation it deems inconsistent with revolutionary principles .

the britpop heroes played for around 150 people in a goods shed at the east anglian railway museum , where they launched their careers in 1988 .
for saturday 's gig , their first show for nine years , they used a vintage carriage as a dressing room and played surrounded by station memorabilia .
they will now go on tour , taking in headline slots at hyde park , glastonbury and t in the park .
read the full gig review below : as the opening chords to parklife kick in , damon albarn bounces like a boxer coming out of retirement for one last title fight .
damon albarn -lrb- right -rrb- and graham coxon have reconciled after falling out he 's no longer the cheeky chappy who jumped about in the parklife video back in the band 's britpop heyday .
but he and his bandmates are up for the fight .
it 's almost a decade since these four musicians performed together , and during that time they have gone their very different ways -lrb- monkey operas , cheese-making and politics , to name a few -rrb- .
they seem to be friends again , and are clearly relishing the rediscovery of their old songs , which still sound great .
in a couple of weeks , they will be playing those songs for tens of thousands of fans at huge outdoor shows .
but the first warm-up show is different .
it is tiny by comparison , and is special because it is a return to the first place they ever played .
it is also very odd as gig venues go .
a vintage train carriage , which doubles up as their dressing room , is next to the stage , along with an open wagon where the band 's families sit .
old-fashioned signs from clacton-on-sea and southend stations adorn the walls , while from the ceiling we are directed to the ' continental ticket office ' and ' foreign passports ' .
when they get going , it takes a few numbers for the band to be at ease playing as blur again - but not long .
albarn took part in a spot of stage-diving albarn is the focus , as ever - the prize fighter , the jester , the sneering punk and the sensitive thinker , depending on the mood of the song .
he switches between jumping manically , staring pensively and eyeballing the crowd menacingly as the band move from indie anthems to subtle tearjerkers to scuzzy soul-cleansers .
there is no barrier between the crowd and the stage , no line of security , so when albarn dives off stage , he 's instantly carried aloft by outstretched arms .
bassist alex james does his best to steal some of the limelight , standing on his monitor speakers and shaking his floppy fringe , with a cigarette balanced between his lips .
while albarn is covered in sweat , james looks like he has stepped straight out of a timotei commercial .
he is still the coolest man in rock .
all the bases are covered in the 130-minute set as the band burn through girls and boys , there 's no other way , beetlebum , coffee and tv , tender and country house , to huge receptions from the compact crowd .
lighter singles like charmless man become heavier , threatening to blow off the shed 's roof , which this gig is raising money to repair .
the band have not decided whether they will write new material parklife gets 150 arms in the air , and albarn puts his arm around guitarist graham coxon as they join together for the final chorus of end of a century .
coxon asks for a show of hands to choose between essex dogs and sing - being an essex band playing to an essex crowd , he concludes : " essex dogs has it . "
and just as you start thinking there ca n't be many songs left that have stood the test of time , they pull out to the end , song 2 - which makes the place erupt - and for tomorrow .
albarn uses a british rail clock above the crowd to work out how many songs are left before he has to let fans go and get the last train from the adjacent station .
" we 've got six minutes before the last train goes , " he says , before the band finish with the poignant the universal .
it 's hard to think of a post-britpop band who can pluck at the same range of emotions as blur , and whose tunes are underpinned by similarly astute songwriting and storytelling .
they may reclaim the heavyweight crown after all , and there is also now the tantalising prospect of new material .
the smiles between coxon and albarn suggest their friendship might really be back on track , and it 's difficult to imagine two such prolific musicians not being tempted to have a go at writing new songs .
for now , their classic songs are ripe for being revisited and their sound and presence will easily fill the fields where they will play this summer .

the britpop heroes played for around 150 people in a goods shed at the east anglian railway museum , where they launched their careers in 1988 .
for saturday 's gig , their first show for nine years , they used a vintage carriage as a dressing room and played surrounded by station memorabilia .
they will now go on tour , taking in headline slots at hyde park , glastonbury and t in the park .
read the full gig review below : as the opening chords to parklife kick in , damon albarn bounces like a boxer coming out of retirement for one last title fight .
damon albarn -lrb- right -rrb- and graham coxon have reconciled after falling out he 's no longer the cheeky chappy who jumped about in the parklife video back in the band 's britpop heyday .
but he and his bandmates are up for the fight .
it 's almost a decade since these four musicians performed together , and during that time they have gone their very different ways -lrb- monkey operas , cheese-making and politics , to name a few -rrb- .
they seem to be friends again , and are clearly relishing the rediscovery of their old songs , which still sound great .
in a couple of weeks , they will be playing those songs for tens of thousands of fans at huge outdoor shows .
but the first warm-up show is different .
it is tiny by comparison , and is special because it is a return to the first place they ever played .
it is also very odd as gig venues go .
a vintage train carriage , which doubles up as their dressing room , is next to the stage , along with an open wagon where the band 's families sit .
old-fashioned signs from clacton-on-sea and southend stations adorn the walls , while from the ceiling we are directed to the ' continental ticket office ' and ' foreign passports ' .
when they get going , it takes a few numbers for the band to be at ease playing as blur again - but not long .
albarn took part in a spot of stage-diving albarn is the focus , as ever - the prize fighter , the jester , the sneering punk and the sensitive thinker , depending on the mood of the song .
he switches between jumping manically , staring pensively and eyeballing the crowd menacingly as the band move from indie anthems to subtle tearjerkers to scuzzy soul-cleansers .
there is no barrier between the crowd and the stage , no line of security , so when albarn dives off stage , he 's instantly carried aloft by outstretched arms .
bassist alex james does his best to steal some of the limelight , standing on his monitor speakers and shaking his floppy fringe , with a cigarette balanced between his lips .
while albarn is covered in sweat , james looks like he has stepped straight out of a timotei commercial .
he is still the coolest man in rock .
all the bases are covered in the 130-minute set as the band burn through girls and boys , there 's no other way , beetlebum , coffee and tv , tender and country house , to huge receptions from the compact crowd .
lighter singles like charmless man become heavier , threatening to blow off the shed 's roof , which this gig is raising money to repair .
the band have not decided whether they will write new material parklife gets 150 arms in the air , and albarn puts his arm around guitarist graham coxon as they join together for the final chorus of end of a century .
coxon asks for a show of hands to choose between essex dogs and sing - being an essex band playing to an essex crowd , he concludes : " essex dogs has it . "
and just as you start thinking there ca n't be many songs left that have stood the test of time , they pull out to the end , song 2 - which makes the place erupt - and for tomorrow .
albarn uses a british rail clock above the crowd to work out how many songs are left before he has to let fans go and get the last train from the adjacent station .
" we 've got six minutes before the last train goes , " he says , before the band finish with the poignant the universal .
it 's hard to think of a post-britpop band who can pluck at the same range of emotions as blur , and whose tunes are underpinned by similarly astute songwriting and storytelling .
they may reclaim the heavyweight crown after all , and there is also now the tantalising prospect of new material .
the smiles between coxon and albarn suggest their friendship might really be back on track , and it 's difficult to imagine two such prolific musicians not being tempted to have a go at writing new songs .
for now , their classic songs are ripe for being revisited and their sound and presence will easily fill the fields where they will play this summer .

the comments came as he held talks with syria 's president bashar al-assad in the syrian capital .
the visit marks a further thaw in relations between the two countries since mr obama took power in january .
correspondents say the us is testing syria 's support for america 's stated new drive for peace in the region .
" syria has an integral role to play in reaching comprehensive peace , " mr mitchell said on saturday .
but mr mitchell has assured the lebanese government that securing syrian co-operation will not come at beirut 's expense .
he arrived in syria from beirut , and has already visited israel , the west bank , egypt and jordan .
key player on friday us military officials held talks with syrian officials in damascus , which are thought to have included discussions about neighbouring iraq , reuters news agency reported .
mr obama has said he wants to broker a peace deal with syria and israel to end decades of regional conflict .
improved relations with the us could mean a lifting of sanctions and many new business deals - something many ordinary syrians are hoping for .
first step lina sinjab , in damascus the first high-ranking us visit is likely to be followed by many more .
the united states is now talking directly to the country once isolated by the bush administration .
" we are here to talk directly to the syrians and hear directly from them on issues of concern and not to dictate them on any policies , " said a state department official travelling with mr mitchell .
talking directly to the syrians does not mean that all the issues will be solved overnight .
there are still many areas to work on .
the bbc 's lina sinjab in damascus says syria also wants a us ambassador to be appointed after the last ambassador was withdrawn following the assassination of lebanon 's former prime minster rafiq hariri .
she says the syrian government and people want to see us pressure on the israelis to deliver long-awaited promises of peace .
the syrians have also promised to reopen an american cultural centre closed after a us raid last year into syrian territory against suspected al-qaeda militants .
mr mitchell 's visit comes just a week after president obama 's ground-breaking speech in cairo , in which he called for a " new beginning " between muslims and the us , and vowed to pursue aggressively an end to the israeli-palestinian conflict .
