program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .

" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .

he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .

medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 german coalition talks face tough challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are ready to work together coalition negotiations in germany are due to start on october 5 between the conservative cdu / csu and the liberal fdp .
agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .
" coalitions are , after all , not marriages of love , " merkel said. sac / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .

the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .

" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .

" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 heads start rolling in germany 's spd after brutal loss at the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muenterfering , right , and steinmeier : uncertain of the party 's future direction the big losers of germany 's general election were the social democrats ; a miserable showing pushed them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .
un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .
an israeli government investigation has cleared its soldiers of all such charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

together , the two parties have 72 seats out of a total of 132 in the state parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 29.09.2009 world literature expands its horizons in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of literature is larger than some think a new literature prize aims to give african , asian and latin american authors more exposure on the german book market and show what " world literature " can really mean . many germans associate the term " world literature " with us-american and european literature .
to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .

indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .

but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .

regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .
un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .
an israeli government investigation has cleared its soldiers of all such charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .

" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .

un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism .

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 29.09.2009 world literature expands its horizons in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of literature is larger than some think a new literature prize aims to give african , asian and latin american authors more exposure on the german book market and show what " world literature " can really mean . many germans associate the term " world literature " with us-american and european literature .
to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .
even the prominent among them are " relatively unknown , and the young african writer generation will have a much more difficult start . " the more foreign a country or culture appears , the harder it is to sell its literature in germany , klefisch noted . " even open-minded people who are prepared to experience something new find non-european literature a bit hard to grasp , " she said . still , more authors from distant regions are appearing on the literature scene , with a lot to say about the changes taking place in the globalized world .
some of them have experienced migration and exile , as well as the accompanying changes in their cultural identities - much of which is reflected in their work .
the new literature prize could be one way of drawing more attention to their literary efforts . author : christel wester -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .

they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .

he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .

the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .
" coalitions are , after all , not marriages of love , " merkel said. sac / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 heads start rolling in germany 's spd after brutal loss at the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muenterfering , right , and steinmeier : uncertain of the party 's future direction the big losers of germany 's general election were the social democrats ; a miserable showing pushed them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de voter apathy was one of the big winners in germany 's election germany 's mainstream political parties failed to mobilize voters to go to the polls on sunday .
the historic low turnout could trigger calls for compulsory voting to be introduced .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent .

their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism .

" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .

" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .

in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .

" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .

she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 german coalition talks face tough challenges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are ready to work together coalition negotiations in germany are due to start on october 5 between the conservative cdu / csu and the liberal fdp .
agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .

agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .

struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .

the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "

hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .

" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 29.09.2009 world literature expands its horizons in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of literature is larger than some think a new literature prize aims to give african , asian and latin american authors more exposure on the german book market and show what " world literature " can really mean . many germans associate the term " world literature " with us-american and european literature .
to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .
even the prominent among them are " relatively unknown , and the young african writer generation will have a much more difficult start .

" the more foreign a country or culture appears , the harder it is to sell its literature in germany , klefisch noted . " even open-minded people who are prepared to experience something new find non-european literature a bit hard to grasp , " she said . still , more authors from distant regions are appearing on the literature scene , with a lot to say about the changes taking place in the globalized world .
some of them have experienced migration and exile , as well as the accompanying changes in their cultural identities - much of which is reflected in their work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 heads start rolling in germany 's spd after brutal loss at the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muenterfering , right , and steinmeier : uncertain of the party 's future direction the big losers of germany 's general election were the social democrats ; a miserable showing pushed them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reports say scores of people were killed when they defied a ban on rallying at a sports stadium . eu foreign policy chief javier solana condemned the use of force by the guinean junta .
he added , " i urge . . . the immediate release of the arrested political leaders and call on the authorities to exercise maximum restraint and ensure a peaceful and democratic transition . "
condemnation also came from un secretary general ban ki-moon and guinea 's former colonial power france .
the african union said it deplored the " indiscriminate firing on unarmed civilians . "
the leader of the guinean junta , captain moussa dadis camara , sought to distance himself from the killings , saying he was " disgusted " when told about what he called a " confrontation . "
" uncontrollable elements in the military " had committed atrocities , he told radio france international .
attack on peaceful demonstration monday 's crackdown began when thousands of people led by a coalition of opposition parties gathered outside conakry 's largest stadium to challenge any bid by camara to run for president in an election due next january .
witnesses say protestors defied a ban and entered the stadium , which has official capacity for 25,000 .
police squads initially used tear gas and baton charges outside the stadium .
then shots were heard and bodies were later seen in and around the stadium .
the news agency afp quotes a police source as saying 87 bodies were collected .
medical sources said trucks picked up " dozens of bodies " from a hospital , including those of four women , and took them to the alpha yaya diallo military camp , the junta 's headquarters .
other sources put the death toll as high as 157 .

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .

to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .
even the prominent among them are " relatively unknown , and the young african writer generation will have a much more difficult start . " the more foreign a country or culture appears , the harder it is to sell its literature in germany , klefisch noted . " even open-minded people who are prepared to experience something new find non-european literature a bit hard to grasp , " she said . still , more authors from distant regions are appearing on the literature scene , with a lot to say about the changes taking place in the globalized world .
some of them have experienced migration and exile , as well as the accompanying changes in their cultural identities - much of which is reflected in their work .
the new literature prize could be one way of drawing more attention to their literary efforts . author : christel wester -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .
un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .
an israeli government investigation has cleared its soldiers of all such charges .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .

" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .

" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .

" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 29.09.2009 world literature expands its horizons in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of literature is larger than some think a new literature prize aims to give african , asian and latin american authors more exposure on the german book market and show what " world literature " can really mean . many germans associate the term " world literature " with us-american and european literature .
to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .
even the prominent among them are " relatively unknown , and the young african writer generation will have a much more difficult start . " the more foreign a country or culture appears , the harder it is to sell its literature in germany , klefisch noted . " even open-minded people who are prepared to experience something new find non-european literature a bit hard to grasp , " she said . still , more authors from distant regions are appearing on the literature scene , with a lot to say about the changes taking place in the globalized world .
some of them have experienced migration and exile , as well as the accompanying changes in their cultural identities - much of which is reflected in their work .

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 29.09.2009 world literature expands its horizons in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of literature is larger than some think a new literature prize aims to give african , asian and latin american authors more exposure on the german book market and show what " world literature " can really mean . many germans associate the term " world literature " with us-american and european literature .
to help broaden that rather narrow view , the house of world cultures in berlin - germany 's national center for contemporary non-european art - and the elementarteilchen foundation in hamburg , a non-profit organization that supports cultural projects , have introduced the international literature award .
it is to be presented for the first time on september 30 in berlin , distinguishing international works of prose fiction in german translation .
the aim is to attract attention to asian , african and latin american writers and expand the common definition of world literature . a broad selection , but few readers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign books can be challenging german readers still need some convincing , however .
" the specific style of european and american literature has influenced many readers so much , that it 's a real effort for them to read something different , " said barbara klefisch , who works in a bookshop in cologne . klefisch is responsible for the non-european literature section in the shop .
in contrast to many other bookstores , books by african , asian and latin american authors are not only available in large numbers in her store , but also clearly separated from other books .
this arrangement helps to draw customers ' attention to the international titles , which would otherwise easily go unnoticed among the hundreds of other books . political literature from the 70s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house of world cultures in berlin is keen to give foreign writers a voice there are certainly plenty of titles to choose from since the number of translations of non-european books into german has increased in recent years .
at the turn of the 70s , only a few small , politically-minded publishing companies tried to arouse readers ' interest in post-colonial developments .
one was the peter hammer publishing company in the western german town of wuppertal , which was among the first to introduce translations of african and latin american books to the german market .
the political situation at the time was convenient for publishing such books , said peter hammer 's monika bilstein . " there were many people who were interested in exactly that – who were somehow active in third-world issues , " said bilstein .
" this has unfortunately changed over time , but i still have the impression that in the past few years , these books have become a bit more popular again . " the " democratic republic of world literature " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naguib mahfouz 's efforts were rewarded with a nobel prize the interest in non-european literature in the 70s was for the most part politically-generated , while the literary quality of a book was often of secondary importance .
works by many prominent african , asian , caribbean and arab authors were not translated into german until the 1980s . it was a market gap that the swiss-based unionsverlag publishing house decided to fill .
its founder , lucien leitess , aimed to create " a type of democratic republic of world literature , where origin , language and style did not matter . "
he wanted to have all prominent world authors equally represented ; it was an idea that made him a trendsetter of his time and showed his talent for spotting promising authors . in the mid-80s , unionsverlag published the first german translation of a book by egyptian author naguib mahfouz .
in 1988 mahfouz became the first arabic-language author to receive the nobel prize for literature .
on the day of the award 's announcement , sales of his books at unionsverlag increased from 300 to 30,000 copies . foreign ideas hard to convey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author isabel allende comes from chile the successes of individual authors can arouse interest in the literature of entire regions .
peter hammer 's bilstein believes that the reputation of latin american literature has benefitted from success of works by prominent authors like gabriel garcia marquez , isabel allende and mario vargas llosa .
these authors attract many german readers , which " gives the young latin american authors of the future a certain advantage , " bilstein said . however , the same can not be said for african authors , bilstein added .
even the prominent among them are " relatively unknown , and the young african writer generation will have a much more difficult start . " the more foreign a country or culture appears , the harder it is to sell its literature in germany , klefisch noted . " even open-minded people who are prepared to experience something new find non-european literature a bit hard to grasp , " she said . still , more authors from distant regions are appearing on the literature scene , with a lot to say about the changes taking place in the globalized world .
some of them have experienced migration and exile , as well as the accompanying changes in their cultural identities - much of which is reflected in their work .
the new literature prize could be one way of drawing more attention to their literary efforts . author : christel wester -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .
un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .
an israeli government investigation has cleared its soldiers of all such charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .

but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .

he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .

but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .

agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause .

frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent .

" currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "

" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .

" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .

agreement on a major tax reform will be the most contentious point of debate . the leader of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- guido westerwelle said his party will take as much time as necessary for the upcoming talks with the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
the negotiations will be held " quickly , but also carefully , " westerwelle said on tuesday .
the main priority was the thoroughness of the agreements with the cdu / csu , he said .
the talks will determine the government program and distribution of ministerial posts between the conservatives and liberals .
the parties won a joint parliamentary majority in the country 's general election on sunday .
westerwelle already met with chancellor angela merkel on monday .
he said the talks with the head of the cdu were held " in the best of atmospheres . "
but he added that coalition talks " were never easy . "
merkel 's cdu would like the new coalition negotiations to be completed in five to six weeks .
" on november 9 , the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall , i would like to greet the many european heads of state and government and other guests with a new government , " merkel said .
taxes and health top the agenda a major sticking point in the negotiations will be tax cuts .
both the cdu / csu and the fdp have said they plan to cut taxes in the new government - despite a record-high budget deficit and warnings of cuts in social services .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebel and the fdp slogan " work should pay off again " but both sides have different ideas on the tax reform .
the fdp 's general secretary dirk niebel said they would remain tough in negotiations over taxation .
" we only ever had a single condition in the election campaign : we need a real structural tax reform , a simplification and relief in the tax system , " niebel told germany 's phoenix television .
cdu proposals on tax reform have been more modest , envisaging a two-stage adjustment for taxpayers over the next four years .
merkel wants centrist policies the fdp would also like to make it easier for firms to hire and fire workers .
but merkel has indicated she will pursue a fairly centrist course and could temper such moves .
industry lobbies , however , have not held back from demanding greater freedoms .
" we need more flexibility in how the labor market is organized , " dieter hundt , head of the bda employers ' federation , told german daily der tagesspiegel .
the german charity association paritaetische wohlfahrtsverband said the tense economic situation allowed no leeway for tax breaks .
cuts in benefits would lead to even greater social division .
" germany is standing before its most crucial test since its founding and is more socially divided than ever before , " said the charity 's manager ulrich schneider on tuesday .
" in these difficult times of crisis , we need social policies with backbone and judgment . "
in addition to tax issues , the complex and controversial health care fund will also be a bone of contention .
niebel said that the fdp would like to do away with the existing funding system which was introduced by the previous government .
" we will certainly discuss it very intensively in the coalition negotiations , " he told the german daily hamburger abendblatt on tuesday .
but merkel has already said the fund was not up for debate .
cabinet posts still unclear no agreements existed yet on future cabinet posts , according to westerwelle , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is now in the limelight - a position he has worked towards for years " that comes at the end , " said westerwelle , who has never held a ministerial post .
he is expected to become vice-chancellor and foreign minister in the new cabinet , a post often reserved for the junior coalition partner .
westerwelle , who has headed the fdp since 2006 , goes into the coalition talks with his party strongly behind him .
on tuesday , the new fdp parliamentary group confirmed his position as its leader without a dissenting vote .
the centre-right partners last ruled together between 1982 and 1998 under helmut kohl .
merkel said she did n't expect the government work to be easier with the fdp than with the previous coalition partner , the social democrats spd .
" coalitions are , after all , not marriages of love , " merkel said. sac / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.09.2009 brown a labour party hero , at least for one speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown and the labour party will have to fight to be reelected in upcoming elections down in the polls , british prime minister brown had to give what had been billed the " speech of his life " to his labour party .
he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .
he presented himself as a global leader during the financial crisis , and said the opposition conservatives had been wrong on several issues during that time . their policies , he said , would have left britain in an even worse state that it currently is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cameron heads the conservative party , currently the most popular party in britain " they made the wrong choice on northern rock , " he said , referring to the bank that was an early victim of the financial crisis , " the wrong choice on jobs and spending , the wrong choice on mortgage support , the wrong choice on working with europe .
the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .
brown responded to the critics , promising repeatedly to fight .
he said he would , " not bow out , not walk away , not give in , not give up , but fight , fight to win for britain . "
a new strategy one attendee who clearly fell into in the supporter camp was sarah brown , the prime minister 's wife .
she introduced brown , saying he had a job she would n't want .
" but each day i 'm thankful that he 's the one who has it , " she continued , " that he 's the one choosing the policies and making the calls . "
sarah brown is quite popular in britain , and matt west , editor of the political website politics.co.uk , told deutsche welle he thought her inclusion was a tactical move by the party .
" she really reveals the man underneath the sort of veneer of the hard prime minister , that scary persona , " he said .
" they know she 's an asset and they want to use her as such . "

he fought back at critics , took a swing at the conservatives and received a lengthy ovation . british prime minister gordon brown 's labour party is currently in third place among voters .
an ipsos mori poll released on tuesday , just before the labour party annual conference gave the conservatives 36 percent of potential votes , the liberal democrats 25 percent and the labour party 24 percent .
but after speaking at the conference , brown might have felt like the most popular man in the room after fellow party members responded enthusiastically .
struggling to overcome those dismal poll numbers ahead of an election due sometime in the next nine months , brown unveiled a string of new policies in his speech and attempted to put a distance between labour and the conservatives .
he proposed free childcare for low income families , extra measures to tackle anti-social behavior and crime , and a law on bankers ' bonuses and their performance .
" we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers ' bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk and any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post , " he promised .

the only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong , " he said .
despite these confident claims , there have been calls from within his own party for him to stand aside , with some detractors saying that the only chance labour has of winning the next general election is with a different candidate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 29.09.2009 favre out as hertha roller coaster hits bottom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : favre seemed overwhelmed in his final weeks after leading hertha berlin into the bundesliga 's lead pack last season , lucien favre began this one by taking them to the rear .
now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 29.09.2009 germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran has stoked fears again with a new round of missile test in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?
dw spoke to an expert . the un security council 's five permanent members and germany are scheduled to begin talks with iran in geneva on october 1 in an effort to diffuse tensions created by tehran latest tests of short and medium-range missiles .
the goal is to end the impasse over iran 's nuclear ambitions .
but few people expect any sort of major breakthrough , and if the issue remains unresolved , the result could be stepped-up sanctions by the west against iran .
in an interview with german public broadcaster ard , the bush administration 's former point man on iran , nicholas burns , said germany had not been as stringent on sanctions as france or the uk , and he called for greater solidarity from berlin with the us-led effort to rein in tehran .
deutsche welle wanted to know if there was truth to the idea that germany , which is heavily dependent on exports , has been comparatively soft on iran .
so we talked to michael bauer , an iran expert at the center for applied political research at the university of munich .
dw : what is the extent of germany 's trade with iran ?
bauer : germany was , in the past , a very important trading partner for iran .
in the wake of the conflict over iran 's nuclear program , the volume of trade has continually decreased , but germany was and is an important partner in the areas of machinery and technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian government repression of the opposition is another issue dw : has germany pulled its weight vis-à-vis sanctions in the past ?
bauer : the german government tries to encourage german industry to limit trade with iran .
but there have n't been any strict laws formulated as is the case in france or , above all , in great britain .
that 's the reason for the current accusations .
but one has to remember that germany is historically a more important trading partner for iran than either france or great britain .
so the government here is under more pressure from industry not to put german business interests at risk prematurely .
that 's the problem the german government faces .
dw : what will germany 's impending change of government mean for its policy toward iran ?
bauer : i do n't think there will be a major turnaround .
i think germany will continue to play a leading role in negotiations within the framework of the eu big 3 plus , china , russia and the us .
the new government will have the same dilemma as the old one , namely that they hope that there 'll be a breakthrough in relations with iran so that sanctions wo n't be an issue any more .
and on the other hand , german industry fears that , when sanctions are lifted , they 'll be too far behind china and russia to get out of the starting blocks .
the new government will face exactly this problem .
german industry knows how important it is for the iranian people to have access to foreign machinery and technology , and they hope that , should the conflict over iran 's nuclear program be resolved , they 'll be able to do business in iran without any problems .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad did n't make many friends with his scandalous speech at the un dw : are there are options other than sanctions ?
bauer : i think it 's fundamentally difficult to use sanctions to compel a large oil-producing country like iran to change its policies .
iran 's oil and natural-gas reserves make it a very attractive partner for china , russia and other countries .
so you have to ask : how sensible are sanctions , if you know right from the start that they 're their effectiveness is going to be limited ?
with reference to barack obama , there were hopes - supported by statements he himself made - that there 'd be a change in us policy toward iran , similar to the shift toward china under nixon .
right now , of course , the situation is very difficult after the election fraud and the brutal treatment of protestors .
it 's hard to approach such a government .
but that 's in fact the alternative : to take iran 's security concerns vis-à-vis the west seriously and try to allay those fears so that relations take a more positive path .
nonetheless , it probably wo n't come to such a paradigm shift within the situation we 're in now .

the study says both israel and hamas committed war crimes and has both backers and detractors . " a culture of impunity in the region has existed for too long , " the report 's author richard goldstone told the un human rights council in geneva .
" the lack of accountability for war crimes and possible war crimes against humanity has reached a crisis point ; the ongoing lack of justice is undermining any hope for a successful peace process and reinforcing an environment that fosters violence , " goldstone added .
goldstone 's report was published earlier this month but was first officially presented to the council on tuesday .
it urges both israel and the militant palestinian group hamas to launch investigations of their actions in the 22-day conflict that started on dec .
22 , 2008 and left some 1,400 palestinians , mostly civilians , dead .
if they fail to , the study recommends that the matter be turned over to the international criminal court in the hague .
the report is the result of a fact-finding mission to israel and gaza undertaken by goldstone , the south african former chief prosecutor of both the rwanda and yugoslavia war crimes tribunals .
he concluded that israelis had committed war crimes and what were likely crimes against humanity last december and january .
" there is strong evidence to suggest that numerous serious violations of internal law , both humanitarian and human rights law , were committed by israel during the military operations in gaza , " goldstone said , when he initially presented his report .
in contrast to the large number of palestinian deaths , israel suffered only a handful of casualties .
but goldstone was also critical of hamas , whose rocket attacks on targets within israel prompted the israeli 's military incursion into gaza .
" there 's no question that the firing of rockets and mortars was deliberate and calculated to cause loss of life and injury to civilians … , " goldstone said .
" these actions also amount to serious war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity . "
criticism of the criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goldstone is a respected international prosecutor the allegations have not gone down well with any of those criticized - or their allies .
hamas has rejected goldstone 's findings , while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said the study was not objective .
" the game was fixed , " netanyahu said on television after the study was first published .
" from this mandate they say in advance that israel carried out war crimes and now they are filling in the blanks . "
the united states , which holds a seat on the human rights council for the first time since the body was formed in 2006 , has offered support for netanyahu 's position .
" although the report addresses all sides of the conflict , its overwhelming focus is on israel , " state department spokesman ian kelly told reporters .
the us warned that the underlying problem was the lack of a peace settlement between israelis and palestinians , and that the report should not be allowed to stall attempts to restart negotiations between the two sides .
widespread support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the underlying conflict in gaza between israel and hamas has not been resolved goldstone himself has said his work was hindered by a lack of israeli cooperation .
and other countries and organizations have hailed the study .
un secretary general ban ki moon has also voiced support for the study .
" i have again expressed my admiration and support for this report , and i have directed our staff to review the contents of this , upholding the principles of accountability , " ban told reporters .
goldstone 's findings confirm allegations by human-rights groups inside and outside of israel , including b 'tselem , amnesty international , human rights watch and medico internal , that israeli defense forces systemically violated human rights standards during the gaza offensive .
an israeli government investigation has cleared its soldiers of all such charges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 29.09.2009 german court permits muslim to pray in school großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devout muslims pray five times a day the berlin administrative court has ruled that school must provide room for a muslim pupil to pray once a day according to islamic rites outside of class time .
but education authorities are considering an appeal . the 16-year-old , yunus m. , had filed a lawsuit against his school because he wanted to comply with his prayer obligations as a devout muslim .
in the first such legal ruling in germany , the court said on tuesday it saw no disturbance of school operations by the prayer , referring to the freedom of religion .
the court said this basic right did n't only refer to inner freedom to believe in a certain religion , but also the external freedom to express it .
this included prayer .
it could n't be expected from a devout pupil that he only pray outside of school .
the court spokesman , stephan groscurth , said this was an isolated case .
" but other muslim pupils can refer to it , " groscurth said .
the courts would then have to rule on each concrete case one at a time , he said .
the school is now obligated to allow yunus m. to pray in a separate room outside of class time for a 10-minute period .
the school director , brigitte burchardt , said she was disappointed by the ruling .
" if this is a precedence ruling , we can not sustain school operations as they are , " burchardt said .
if only eight more pupils demanded similar treatment , she would n't know how to implement it , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel hosted an integration summit for youth in berlin last year " i have to consider the freedom of 650 pupils , " burchardt said .
up to 90 percent of them are from migrant backgrounds .
all major world religions are represented in the diesterweg high school in berlin-wedding .
but the ruling judge uwe wegener said he did not see the acute danger of a wide number of pupils demanding rooms for prayer .
wegener also said he could not determine in this case that yunus ' acts of prayer caused or deepened conflicts between pupils of various religions in day-to-day school life .
school authorities considering appeal the education senate in berlin said it fears that the decision will force public schools to forfeit their neutrality and that " islands of beliefs " could be formed .
" of course the school will accept the court decision and implement it in accordance with the law , though , " the senate said .
the chairman of the city-state 's parents ' board , andre schindler , said the organization feared that the ruling would further diminish the willingness of muslim pupils to integrate themselves .
the board has called on the berlin senate to appeal the decision .
the education senate said it will decide on whether to do so after it has examined the written judgment .
yunus not an extremist wegener said that yunus had plausibly proven that he considered it his religious duty to pray five times a day according to islamic rites .
he said he did not see any possibility of completely abstaining from prayer during school .
this could not be expected from him , wegener said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court relied on expertise from a scholar of islam the islam expert and law professor at the university of nuremburg-erlangen , mathias rohe , provided the court with an expert opinion on the case .
rohe told the court that yunus ' request was in accordance with islamic beliefs and therefore religious freedom .
he said this was not the case of an extremist who wanted to implement something " by hook or by crook . "
the court had already issued an injunction against the school in march 2008 , allowing the teenager to pray once a day during a class break .
since then , the school has permitted him to pray in an extra room provided for 10 minutes a day .
previously , the teenager had kneeled down in the school 's hallway on his jacket to pray , while other pupils watched .
director burchardt had forbidden this , referring to the school 's secular status. sac / dpa / afp / ap editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he ’ s paid the price , and hertha are casting a wide net for a successor . when lucien favre arrived from switzerland in 2007 , he promised a revolution .
one that would lift hertha bsc , the german capital 's moribund club , out of its impulsive and underachieving past into a stable future built on solid footballing fundamentals .
that included : a young , athletic first team of players capable of filling positional gaps all over the field ; a youth system built around his preferred playing style , feeding new talent into the senior side at regular intervals ; a power structure in which the coach and general manager understood and agreed on the basics of which players to bring in and how to treat them .
favre got his revolution , even accomplishing a healthy proportion of those goals .
but he forgot to reckon with the volatile aftermath of revolutions .
they often include backbiting , backroom intrigue , and yes , a seemingly suicidal series of purges .
setbacks follow success first the club , on favre 's wishes , parted ways with its mercurial striker marko pantelic .
then hertha pushed out its long-time sporting director dieter hoeness .
then it lost its back-line boss josip simunic to a buy-out clause in his contract , and followed that up by failing to put enough money together to buy the forward andrey voronin from liverpool , who had played such a big part in hertha 's success while on loan there last season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pantelic celebrates one of his many goals for berlin the club had lost some of its most dependable hands , but lucien favre suspected he could weather whatever storm might come .
when some of his buys from this summer failed to produce the goods - and an injury crisis hit - however , there was nowhere left to hide .
and then there was nobody left to purge but favre himself .
seeds of discord four-and-a-half months ago , in mid-may , it would have been unthinkable for hertha to fire the swiss coach .
with two games to play , the club was a point off the top spot , in the frame for champions league football the next season , and had an easier run-in than some of its rivals .
then the team drew at home to a mid-table schalke -lrb- who had nothing to play for -rrb- , and were hammered 4-0 away to karlsruhe -lrb- who were just about as good as relegated -rrb- .
at the time it seemed like bad luck , or a sign of a team that just did n't have anything left in the tank after a long season of overachieving .
but with the benefit of hindsight , it 's clear some of the troubles that got favre fired really did start with the team 's skid across the finish line in may .
problems with players after a red-card suspension in april , andrey voronin had been in and out of the starting line-up .
against schalke he was out of it , and presented a sullen front to reporters afterward .
he had a partner in crime , too , in hertha captain arne friedrich .
the defender was out injured for six games leading up to the schalke match , and grumbled afterward to the press about not playing .
even though hertha had won four of its six matches and had kept things tight at the back in his absence , he felt that , as captain , he deserved to start .
favre reacted like a man who felt he needed to set a clear disciplinary line .
despite hertha 's needing a spark in its last match in order to regain its champions league place , favre did n't put friedrich -lrb- or voronin for that matter -rrb- in the starting eleven for the karlsruhe match .
indifferent captain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha captain friedrich clashed with coach favre as hertha 's ship has gone down this season , arne friedrich has cut a startlingly indifferent figure .
he has played well at times , at others badly , but has hardly filled the role demanded from him as captain : to motivate and stabilize the squad as it went through a difficult period .
and as defensive organizer , friedrich receives a failing grade after seven games .
without his onetime partner in central defense , josip simunic , hertha has shipped in 17 goals - with a whopping nine in the last two matches alone .
it 's questionable that friedrich has been deliberately playing badly in order to speed up favre 's departure , as some have accused him of doing .
but it would seem almost certain that the 30-year-old did n't feel like giving much more than the minimum required of him - especially if it meant helping out a boss he no longer liked or trusted .
he 's likely to have upset some of his teammates , and a significant number of the club 's fans have turned on him - so the disappearing act may well cost friedrich the hertha captaincy .
and moreover , as the team 's actual motivational heart , long-time central midfielder pal dardai , reminded him this week , " if he keeps playing like this he might not be in the national team much longer . ”
where to ?
regardless of the grounds for favre 's exit , the immediate result is clear : hertha needs a new coach , and soon .
interim coach karsten heine can be all but ruled out .
he 's led the team three times before , always on a short-term interim basis and has never been seriously considered for the job .
so-called ' firemen ' in the mold of hans meyer -lrb- who has saved hertha once before -rrb- are also rumored to be out , as the club management believe it 's too early in the season to turn to a coach who is certain to be a one-season-and-done solution .
speculation has turned , then , to coaches with hertha connections whom the club could see taking over for the longer term .
juergen roeber , who led hertha during its last , brief period of glory at the turn of the century , is said to be a candidate .
he 's recently seen his club in turkey get relegated by the fa there under controversial circumstances , and may be looking for a way out .
surprises are possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus is pictured with models as often as footballers other names that have come up are kjetil rekdal and eyjolfur sverrisson , who fit the profile in that they are both former players from roeber 's time .
but neither one has been much of a success as a coach .
without a doubt the most interesting rumor is that hertha are considering hiring lothar matthaeus .
he 's germany 's most-capped player , and has had largely successful coaching stints in hungary , serbia , austria and israel .
but he is also a magnet for the tabloid press and was , during his playing career , famously difficult to get along with .
because of this prickly reputation - and the perception that , despite his obvious mastery of the game , he might be more a distraction than a help - matthaeus has never landed a job in germany .
he may have to wait a bit longer .
but if there 's a club audacious -lrb- or reckless -rrb- enough to give him a shot , it might well be hertha .

journalists are being prevented from independent reporting by highly-developed restrictions .
using these themes as a backdrop at their yearly conference , the leaders of the five largest international broadcasters from the western world called for governments around the world to lift restrictions on freedom of the press .
in berlin , they appealed for the unrestricted implementation of article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights , which gives everyone “ the right to freedom of opinion and expression ; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek , receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers . ”
the directors stated that the status of a democracy can be identified by which degree the freedom of opinion , information and the press are guaranteed , as these are essential for dialogue between cultures and the exchange of opinions and ideas .
they pointed out that in the past few years the media , and particularly international media , were subjected again and again to restrictions during the period leading to elections .
this includes the disruption of radio broadcasts , internet censorship and the intimidation and prosecution of journalists .
the directors stated that this applies especially to afghanistan , burma and iran .
nevertheless , brave people around the world are fighting for their right of freedom of opinion .
“ we are impressed by the resourcefulness and the perseverance that individuals are exhibiting around the globe by using digital media to communicate across borders , ” said deutsche welle director general erik bettermann , currently the chairman of the group of directors .
“ it marks the beginning of a new era in communication .
one that allows for eyewitness reports from events to be produced and published , often with additional audio-visual material – even though the government would like to keep such reports quiet .
international broadcasters can profit from that as well . ”
several nations have extended their restrictions beyond radio to include internet and new media , in order to decrease access to information even further .
authoritarian nations that don ’ t have the required resources to block or disable new media have reverted to traditional methods of repression and intimidation – like expensive legal proceedings , long-term imprisonment and confiscation of property – to suppress the flow of independent news .
according to reporters without borders , journalist is still one of the most dangerous professions .
“ this reinforces our determination to intensify our actions for a global , civil society .
one in which the free flow of information and dialogue between cultures is possible , ” said bettermann .
even when the use of multimedia technology has become an essential part of everyday life for many , the directors said “ we can ’ t ignore the fact that only one-third of people around the world have access to independent information .
in addition , the global financial crisis has made the situation worse for many media institutions – especially for small , independent radio stations . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? dw-tv europe live journal - mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the big losers of germany 's latest general election were the center-left social democrats ; double-digit losses at the polls shunted them into the opposition for the first time in 11 years .
in the wake of electoral disaster , heads have begun to roll . the spd started a round of heavy soul searching - and some related position-jostling - after it lost 11 percentage points in sunday 's election to pull just 23 percent of the votes .
their loss allowed chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- enough seats to pick a new coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , or fdp . early on tuesday , party chief franz muentefering said he would step down at the party congress in mid-november to make way for some new blood at the top of the social democrat hierarchy .
muentefering had returned to active politics just a year ago , after a nearly three year pause . " i have made it clear that i am aware of my responsibility as party leader , " muentefering told journalists in berlin on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heil is the latest casualty of the election fiasco another shamefaced withdrawal came later on tuesday , when general secretary hubertus heil said he , too , would step aside in november .
observers say the most likely candidate for his spot is deputy party chief andrea nahles , who comes from the far-left branch of the spd . the outgoing finance minister and deputy party chair peer staeinbrueck then said he was stepping down from all his party positions . turbulent times ahead the early withdrawals point to a turbulent period of change ahead for the newly humbled spd . for one thing , as shocked party leaders pick themselves up and dust themselves off in the wake of their worst-ever postwar campaign showing , the spd may reconsider its relationship to the radical-left left party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier can not think his way out of this debacle the spd is expected to finalize its staffing decisions in the next two weeks .
frank-walter steinmeier , whose campaign for chancellor was so lackluster that it was repaid by germany 's lowest-ever voter turnout , was hoping to become the new parliamentary party chief , replacing peter struck , who 's retiring , as the party 's leader in the bundestag .
the party executive committee has agreed to the plan . but a chorus of voices from within the spd are hoping to change that course of events .
in berlin , hecklers within the party - led by berlin mayor klaus wowereit - are agitating for a radical new beginning . calls for change at the top according to an internal paper put out by the berlin spd and cited on berlin broadcaster rbb-inforadio , wowereit and his colleagues say only if all three top politicos - muentefering , steinmeier and struck - step down can the party regain credibility . the spd 's leader in the berlin senate , michael mueller , told rbb : " we want new faces and new names .
a generational change has to be felt personally , and now . " currently , the outgoing environment minister , sigmar gabriel , who campaigned on a strong anti-nuclear message , is seen as a front-runner for the party leadership . muentefering cites voter apathy for his part , muentefering denied that the spd 's unpopularity was personality-driven or the result of a bad election campaign , although he did acknowledge there had been a " loss of trust and credibility " in the party . rather , he chalked up the disastrous result to apathy after the spd spent 11 years in government : " we lost to a high degree to non-voters , " muentefering told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's klaus wowereit is calling for a fresh start whether or not that is true , one thing is certain : after splits opened up between the spd and its traditional blue-collar voter base over social-welfare cuts carried out when it held power under ex-chancellor gerhard schroeder , smaller parties stepped in to suck energy and votes away from the social democrats . shift to the left ? on sunday , oskar lafontaine 's left party saw its position confirmed as the fourth largest group in the bundestag , with 11.9 percent of the vote .
the eco-friendly greens saw a two-percentage-point rise , to 10.7 percent . " the left party has definitively changed the german party system , " a jubilant lafontaine told reporters . based on the election showing , some observers predict the social democrats will need to look leftward for inspiration in the future - as indeed the likely replacement of heil with nahles shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party 's lafontaine got his message to voters hans vorlaender , a political scientist at the university of dresden , told reuters news service : " if they want to be in power again , the spd is going to have to shift to the left and reorganize its leadership . indeed , in response to relentless attacks by lafontaine saying the spd was compromising its working-class values , some left-wing social democratic leaders have urged the party to show a more socially responsible side . but the party has also faced pressure from its conservative flank not to buckle to irresponsible populism . " there will need to be a balance between the left of the party and those who supported the policies enacted under schroeder , " vorlaender told reuters . jen / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nancy isenson / michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 850,000 votes they won in national elections wo n't get them into parliament , but it will get them campaign funds . the pirate party won 2 percent of the vote , putting them well over the 0.5 percent threshold required to get campaign funding from the federal government .
parties receive public funding in proportion to their results in the previous election , which means that the pirates are due more than 700,000 euros -lrb- over $ 1 million -rrb- for their coffers .
and for every euro in private donations , the german government will provide a match of 38 cents .
party chief jens seipenbusch told german broadcaster zdf that he already he 's already considering ways to invest the money - hiring new personnel to handle the party 's growth and buying software and equipment to facilitate online voting and discussion for members .
the establishment of a political foundation , a fixture of all of germany 's major parties , is also a possibility .
" the election showed that our topics are important and that we will be successful in the future , " seipenbusch told dpa news agency at a victory celebration on sunday .
focus on civil liberties founded in 2006 , the pirate party now includes more than 9,200 members .
last month , the party gained seats on city councils in muenster and aachen .
its platform focuses on civil liberties - protection from surveillance in public areas , for example - and digital freedoms , such as support for internet neutrality and the scaling back of copyrights .
bildunterschrift : the pirates did best among young males but the pirate party has been silent regarding some of the bigger issues in germany , such as military involvement in afghanistan and whether to use tax cuts to stimulate the economy .
the pirates appear to have found their strongest support on sunday among young , tech-savvy voters , particularly males .
according to a survey by forschungsgruppe wahlen pollsters , 10.2 percent of men under 30 voted for the party .
the pirate party failed to reach the 5 percent threshold needed to get seats in germany 's parliament , but that has n't prevented them from looking ahead .
it is now setting its sights on may 2010 , when the most populous german state , north rhine-westphalia , elects its state parliament. svs / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

col gaddafi wandered around shops in the island 's luxury sambil arcade , buying jewellery and digital cameras .
he also posed for photographs with excited shop workers .
col gaddafi is in venezuela for a summit of south american and african leaders , where he has denounced the " imperialism " of wealthy nations .
" it was all so totally unexpected , " carlos morales , who works at star pc in the sambil shopping centre , told the bbc .
mr morales said the libyan leader was accompanied by an entourage of about 25 people , including friends and security guards .
" to begin with , we did n't think he was going to come in , there were so many of them .
but then he suddenly did and we did n't know what to do , " he said .

it predicted 300 community treatment orders in the first year but 10 times as many applications have been made .
psychiatrists told bbc file on 4 this had left them having to " bend the rules " when unable to get signatures of two doctors that are needed on orders .
but a minister responded that ctos were making a difference to people 's lives .
in the first 10 months since ctos came into force in 2008 , 3,777 applications have been made , according to the care quality commission , the independent regulator of social care in britain .
under a cto , severely ill patients must take their medication or face being returned to a psychiatric unit .
two doctors should sign the order but psychiatrists claim the huge volume of ctos makes this difficult .
ctos came into effect under amendments to the 2007 mental health act which gave psychiatrists the power to send a patient straight back to hospital if they refused to take their medication .
doctors ' dilemma consultant psychiatrist dr tony zigmond , of the newsam centre at seacroft hospital , leeds , told bbc file on 4 the second opinion system had major problems .
find out more listen to file on 4 , bbc radio 4 2000 bst , tuesday 29 september 2009 , repeated 1700 , sunday 4 october 2009 .
listen on iplayer download the podcast " this is partly because of the very large number of ctos that have been put in place - far greater than the government predicted - and partly because it has proven very difficult for second opinion doctors to see the patient , " he said .
dr zigmond added : " one of the problems has been the recruitment of second opinion doctors - there are just not enough of them . "
the care quality commission , which said the government under-estimate had put a strain on services , has advised doctors to invoke a clause in the 2007 act which allows ctos to continue without a second opinion .
the law states that this get-out clause should apply in an emergency where treatment is " immediately necessary " to save a patient 's life , prevent a serious deterioration of their condition , alleviate serious suffering or stop them behaving violently .
but dr zigmond said these conditions did not apply in the regular administration of ctos , putting psychiatrists in an impossible position and leaving them torn between breaking the law or leaving their patients unmedicated .
" that 's why it is such an unsatisfactory position - one either puts the patient and perhaps others at risk by not giving treatment or one gives treatment and is perhaps breaking the law .
" the vast majority continue to medicate even if that is bending or breaking the law . "
' advice ignored ' another psychiatrist , who did not want to be named , told file on 4 : " the sheer numbers of ctos in place have overwhelmed the service .
the department of health made a serious miscalculation .
" some of my patients have not been seen by a second opinion doctor even after three months of being on a cto . "
marjorie wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity sane , said : " it 's a pity that what set out to be a provision to help patients to be treated in the community should have been so ill-prepared .
" we fear that the shortage of psychiatrists may affect the number of people who could otherwise benefit and potentially compromise the protective safeguards written in the new mental health act . "
tom burns , professor of social psychiatry at oxford university , who advised the government on ctos , said the politicians ignored advice and were too ambitious in their implementation of the policy .
" this is a perfect example where some preliminary legislation might have made it possible to introduce a pilot scheme to run three or four years . "
louis appleby , national clinical director for mental health at the department of health , said : " community treatment orders are making a real difference to people 's lives and provides an important legal framework to help professionals ensure that patients get the treatment they need .
" doctors do not need to bend any rules to use them ; the mental health act gives them the legal authority they need to treat people .
" there is no shortage of psychiatrists ; the issue is how many psychiatrists train to be second opinion doctors .
there are 65 % more psychiatrists than there were 10 years ago , most of whom can apply to become second opinion doctors .
" the care quality commission is encouraging more psychiatrists come foreword to become second opinion doctors . "

it predicted 300 community treatment orders in the first year but 10 times as many applications have been made .
psychiatrists told bbc file on 4 this had left them having to " bend the rules " when unable to get signatures of two doctors that are needed on orders .
but a minister responded that ctos were making a difference to people 's lives .
in the first 10 months since ctos came into force in 2008 , 3,777 applications have been made , according to the care quality commission , the independent regulator of social care in britain .
under a cto , severely ill patients must take their medication or face being returned to a psychiatric unit .
two doctors should sign the order but psychiatrists claim the huge volume of ctos makes this difficult .
ctos came into effect under amendments to the 2007 mental health act which gave psychiatrists the power to send a patient straight back to hospital if they refused to take their medication .
doctors ' dilemma consultant psychiatrist dr tony zigmond , of the newsam centre at seacroft hospital , leeds , told bbc file on 4 the second opinion system had major problems .
find out more listen to file on 4 , bbc radio 4 2000 bst , tuesday 29 september 2009 , repeated 1700 , sunday 4 october 2009 .
listen on iplayer download the podcast " this is partly because of the very large number of ctos that have been put in place - far greater than the government predicted - and partly because it has proven very difficult for second opinion doctors to see the patient , " he said .
dr zigmond added : " one of the problems has been the recruitment of second opinion doctors - there are just not enough of them . "
the care quality commission , which said the government under-estimate had put a strain on services , has advised doctors to invoke a clause in the 2007 act which allows ctos to continue without a second opinion .
the law states that this get-out clause should apply in an emergency where treatment is " immediately necessary " to save a patient 's life , prevent a serious deterioration of their condition , alleviate serious suffering or stop them behaving violently .
but dr zigmond said these conditions did not apply in the regular administration of ctos , putting psychiatrists in an impossible position and leaving them torn between breaking the law or leaving their patients unmedicated .
" that 's why it is such an unsatisfactory position - one either puts the patient and perhaps others at risk by not giving treatment or one gives treatment and is perhaps breaking the law .
" the vast majority continue to medicate even if that is bending or breaking the law . "
' advice ignored ' another psychiatrist , who did not want to be named , told file on 4 : " the sheer numbers of ctos in place have overwhelmed the service .
the department of health made a serious miscalculation .
" some of my patients have not been seen by a second opinion doctor even after three months of being on a cto . "
marjorie wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity sane , said : " it 's a pity that what set out to be a provision to help patients to be treated in the community should have been so ill-prepared .
" we fear that the shortage of psychiatrists may affect the number of people who could otherwise benefit and potentially compromise the protective safeguards written in the new mental health act . "
tom burns , professor of social psychiatry at oxford university , who advised the government on ctos , said the politicians ignored advice and were too ambitious in their implementation of the policy .
" this is a perfect example where some preliminary legislation might have made it possible to introduce a pilot scheme to run three or four years . "
louis appleby , national clinical director for mental health at the department of health , said : " community treatment orders are making a real difference to people 's lives and provides an important legal framework to help professionals ensure that patients get the treatment they need .
" doctors do not need to bend any rules to use them ; the mental health act gives them the legal authority they need to treat people .
" there is no shortage of psychiatrists ; the issue is how many psychiatrists train to be second opinion doctors .
there are 65 % more psychiatrists than there were 10 years ago , most of whom can apply to become second opinion doctors .
" the care quality commission is encouraging more psychiatrists come foreword to become second opinion doctors . "

it predicted 300 community treatment orders in the first year but 10 times as many applications have been made .
psychiatrists told bbc file on 4 this had left them having to " bend the rules " when unable to get signatures of two doctors that are needed on orders .
but a minister responded that ctos were making a difference to people 's lives .
in the first 10 months since ctos came into force in 2008 , 3,777 applications have been made , according to the care quality commission , the independent regulator of social care in britain .
under a cto , severely ill patients must take their medication or face being returned to a psychiatric unit .
two doctors should sign the order but psychiatrists claim the huge volume of ctos makes this difficult .
ctos came into effect under amendments to the 2007 mental health act which gave psychiatrists the power to send a patient straight back to hospital if they refused to take their medication .
doctors ' dilemma consultant psychiatrist dr tony zigmond , of the newsam centre at seacroft hospital , leeds , told bbc file on 4 the second opinion system had major problems .
find out more listen to file on 4 , bbc radio 4 2000 bst , tuesday 29 september 2009 , repeated 1700 , sunday 4 october 2009 .
listen on iplayer download the podcast " this is partly because of the very large number of ctos that have been put in place - far greater than the government predicted - and partly because it has proven very difficult for second opinion doctors to see the patient , " he said .
dr zigmond added : " one of the problems has been the recruitment of second opinion doctors - there are just not enough of them . "
the care quality commission , which said the government under-estimate had put a strain on services , has advised doctors to invoke a clause in the 2007 act which allows ctos to continue without a second opinion .
the law states that this get-out clause should apply in an emergency where treatment is " immediately necessary " to save a patient 's life , prevent a serious deterioration of their condition , alleviate serious suffering or stop them behaving violently .
but dr zigmond said these conditions did not apply in the regular administration of ctos , putting psychiatrists in an impossible position and leaving them torn between breaking the law or leaving their patients unmedicated .
" that 's why it is such an unsatisfactory position - one either puts the patient and perhaps others at risk by not giving treatment or one gives treatment and is perhaps breaking the law .
" the vast majority continue to medicate even if that is bending or breaking the law . "
' advice ignored ' another psychiatrist , who did not want to be named , told file on 4 : " the sheer numbers of ctos in place have overwhelmed the service .
the department of health made a serious miscalculation .
" some of my patients have not been seen by a second opinion doctor even after three months of being on a cto . "
marjorie wallace , chief executive of the mental health charity sane , said : " it 's a pity that what set out to be a provision to help patients to be treated in the community should have been so ill-prepared .
" we fear that the shortage of psychiatrists may affect the number of people who could otherwise benefit and potentially compromise the protective safeguards written in the new mental health act . "
tom burns , professor of social psychiatry at oxford university , who advised the government on ctos , said the politicians ignored advice and were too ambitious in their implementation of the policy .
" this is a perfect example where some preliminary legislation might have made it possible to introduce a pilot scheme to run three or four years . "
louis appleby , national clinical director for mental health at the department of health , said : " community treatment orders are making a real difference to people 's lives and provides an important legal framework to help professionals ensure that patients get the treatment they need .
" doctors do not need to bend any rules to use them ; the mental health act gives them the legal authority they need to treat people .
" there is no shortage of psychiatrists ; the issue is how many psychiatrists train to be second opinion doctors .
there are 65 % more psychiatrists than there were 10 years ago , most of whom can apply to become second opinion doctors .
" the care quality commission is encouraging more psychiatrists come foreword to become second opinion doctors . "
