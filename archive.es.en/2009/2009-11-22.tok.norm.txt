but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .

" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 czechs discover lure of shopping malls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square is also a popular shopping destination since the fall of communism , czechs have taken to western-style consumer culture with great enthusiasm .
but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 czechs discover lure of shopping malls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square is also a popular shopping destination since the fall of communism , czechs have taken to western-style consumer culture with great enthusiasm .
but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .

as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

the white house said obama looked forward to " thorough " debate on his top domestic initiative . senators voted 60-39 to formally debate obama 's top priority plan to extend healthcare coverage to some 31 million american uninsured and bar insurers from denying coverage to those with existing illnesses .
the house of representatives had narrowly passed its own version on november 7 . the senate debate itself is expected to begin on november 30 and last at least three weeks .
if passed , the senate bill would be reconciled with the house version within a mediation committee in january before being forwarded to president obama for signing .
if so , the legislation would reshape the 2.5 trillion dollar us healthcare system , which accounts for one-sixth of the us economy .
subsidies would be offered to help low-income earners .

the holdouts , blanche lincoln and mary landrieu , moderates from conservative southern us states , said they still wanted changes to the final legislation , including cost safeguards for small businesses .
" more work needs to be done , " landrieu said , " before i can support this effort . "
she also pressed for more funds for medicaid , government health aid for the poor .
senate republicans vow tough debate republican senate leader mitch mcconnell said he would use whatever means he had to delay or block obama 's legislation as mid-term congressional elections approach in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican leader in senate , mitch mcconnell republicans say the package is a costly government intrusion into private lives and the commercial health sector .

" we can see the finish line now , but we 're not there yet . "
white house says obama grateful white house spokesman robert gibbs said the " historic " senate vote had moved the usa closer to ending " insurance company abuses " and reining in spiraling health costs .
" the president looks forward to a thorough and productive debate , " gibbs said .
the united states ranks as one of the few industrialized democracies that does not provide health care coverage to all its citizens .

the territory in question is the nagorno-karabakh enclave which has been under the control of armenian troops and ethnic armenian forces since 1994 .
" if that meeting ends without result , then our hopes in negotiations will be exhausted and then we are left with no other option , " aliyev said on saturday .
" we have the right to liberate our land by military means . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorno-karabakh is under armenian control since 1994 azerbaijan is aiming to strike a deal whereby most of the seven azeri districts captured during the war with armenia would be returned .
the meeting between armenia 's serzh sargsyan and azerbaijan 's ilham aliyev is due to take place at the residence of the french consul general and will be mediated by western diplomats .
if war were to erupt , it would threaten a key oil and gas transit region to the west .
it will be the sixth time the two leaders have met this year , and the first meeting since armenia normalized diplomatic ties with turkey after a century of hostility. vj / reuters / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 czechs discover lure of shopping malls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square is also a popular shopping destination since the fall of communism , czechs have taken to western-style consumer culture with great enthusiasm .
but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .

can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .

the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .
there , it would be processed into fuel for tehran 's medical research reactor . " we urge iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations , " officials said in a statement after talks in brussels . however , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei , speaking in berlin on friday , said he did not believe iran had dismissed the offer outright .

police said that they were doing everything possible to stop attacks .
" it is a reckless act , not just in doing damage but also the potential loss of life , " said northern ireland 's police chief , matt baggott .
" this attack is an attack on the well-being of everybody in northern ireland , " he said .
flare-up of violence northern ireland was troubled by violence between catholic and protestant communities for three decades before the good friday agreement in 1998 ushered in a period of relative peace .
but two british soldiers and a police officer were killed in march this year , highlighting the renewed threat posed by dissident paramilitary groups .
earlier this month , the independent monitoring commission said the danger posed by militant splinter groups was " very serious . "

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats say there are " too many conflicting statements " coming out of tehran " the aim of the drill is to display iran 's combat readiness and military potential , " he added .
tehran has held such demonstrations in the past to warn would-be attackers of its military might .
the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .
there , it would be processed into fuel for tehran 's medical research reactor . " we urge iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations , " officials said in a statement after talks in brussels . however , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei , speaking in berlin on friday , said he did not believe iran had dismissed the offer outright . " the ball is now in iran 's court .
i hope they will not miss this fleeting chance , " he told reporters . vj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de elbaradei urges iran to agree to fuel deal by year 's end with just over a week until he steps down , un nuclear watchdog chief mohamed elbaradei has made a last-ditch bid to iran to accept international offers to process its enriched uranium abroad by the end of 2009 .

the attack highlights the danger dissident militant groups still present . a potentially devastating bomb attack on a police headquarters in belfast , northern ireland on saturday night failed when a massive car bomb did not detonate fully . on sunday , police said the 180-kilogram -lrb- 400-pound -rrb- device would have caused " widespread destruction " had it functioned as planned .
it is thought that the attack was launched by dissident republicans intent on undermining the province 's fragile peace process .
a car crashed through barriers and onto the grounds of the supervisory northern ireland policing board in belfast 's dockland area on saturday evening .
two people were seen running away before the vehicle burst into flames , but failed to blow up .
the building , which was undamaged , is the headquarters of a cross-community panel that oversees police operations .
as such , it is a symbol of efforts to bring the uk-loyalist protestant and irish nationalist catholic communities together .
police on sunday said they had arrested two men near the border with ireland , suspected of being behind the failed attack .
sensitive time those responsible have been condemned for trying to derail peace negotiations , which are at a critical stage .
loyalist and nationalist politicians are currently at loggerheads over when responsibility for policing and justice should return to the province .
currently , those functions are carried out by politicians in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence between the protestant and catholic communities haunted the province for decades " very clearly these people are trying to undermine the progress that has been made in northern ireland in recent years , " said britain 's northern ireland security minister paul goggins , " when attacks like these happen , it brings people together with the strong message that these dissidents will not succeed , " he said .
police said that they were doing everything possible to stop attacks .
" it is a reckless act , not just in doing damage but also the potential loss of life , " said northern ireland 's police chief , matt baggott .
" this attack is an attack on the well-being of everybody in northern ireland , " he said .
flare-up of violence northern ireland was troubled by violence between catholic and protestant communities for three decades before the good friday agreement in 1998 ushered in a period of relative peace .
but two british soldiers and a police officer were killed in march this year , highlighting the renewed threat posed by dissident paramilitary groups .
earlier this month , the independent monitoring commission said the danger posed by militant splinter groups was " very serious . "
in a separate incident on saturday , gunmen ambushed and shot at police in a village on the border with the republic of ireland .
no police were hurt and three people were arrested. rc / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats say there are " too many conflicting statements " coming out of tehran " the aim of the drill is to display iran 's combat readiness and military potential , " he added .
tehran has held such demonstrations in the past to warn would-be attackers of its military might .
the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .

the attack highlights the danger dissident militant groups still present . a potentially devastating bomb attack on a police headquarters in belfast , northern ireland on saturday night failed when a massive car bomb did not detonate fully . on sunday , police said the 180-kilogram -lrb- 400-pound -rrb- device would have caused " widespread destruction " had it functioned as planned .
it is thought that the attack was launched by dissident republicans intent on undermining the province 's fragile peace process .
a car crashed through barriers and onto the grounds of the supervisory northern ireland policing board in belfast 's dockland area on saturday evening .
two people were seen running away before the vehicle burst into flames , but failed to blow up .
the building , which was undamaged , is the headquarters of a cross-community panel that oversees police operations .
as such , it is a symbol of efforts to bring the uk-loyalist protestant and irish nationalist catholic communities together .
police on sunday said they had arrested two men near the border with ireland , suspected of being behind the failed attack .
sensitive time those responsible have been condemned for trying to derail peace negotiations , which are at a critical stage .
loyalist and nationalist politicians are currently at loggerheads over when responsibility for policing and justice should return to the province .
currently , those functions are carried out by politicians in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence between the protestant and catholic communities haunted the province for decades " very clearly these people are trying to undermine the progress that has been made in northern ireland in recent years , " said britain 's northern ireland security minister paul goggins , " when attacks like these happen , it brings people together with the strong message that these dissidents will not succeed , " he said .
police said that they were doing everything possible to stop attacks .
" it is a reckless act , not just in doing damage but also the potential loss of life , " said northern ireland 's police chief , matt baggott .
" this attack is an attack on the well-being of everybody in northern ireland , " he said .
flare-up of violence northern ireland was troubled by violence between catholic and protestant communities for three decades before the good friday agreement in 1998 ushered in a period of relative peace .
but two british soldiers and a police officer were killed in march this year , highlighting the renewed threat posed by dissident paramilitary groups .
earlier this month , the independent monitoring commission said the danger posed by militant splinter groups was " very serious . "
in a separate incident on saturday , gunmen ambushed and shot at police in a village on the border with the republic of ireland .
no police were hurt and three people were arrested. rc / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the white house said obama looked forward to " thorough " debate on his top domestic initiative . senators voted 60-39 to formally debate obama 's top priority plan to extend healthcare coverage to some 31 million american uninsured and bar insurers from denying coverage to those with existing illnesses .
the house of representatives had narrowly passed its own version on november 7 . the senate debate itself is expected to begin on november 30 and last at least three weeks .
if passed , the senate bill would be reconciled with the house version within a mediation committee in january before being forwarded to president obama for signing .
if so , the legislation would reshape the 2.5 trillion dollar us healthcare system , which accounts for one-sixth of the us economy .
subsidies would be offered to help low-income earners .

the white house said obama looked forward to " thorough " debate on his top domestic initiative . senators voted 60-39 to formally debate obama 's top priority plan to extend healthcare coverage to some 31 million american uninsured and bar insurers from denying coverage to those with existing illnesses .
the house of representatives had narrowly passed its own version on november 7 . the senate debate itself is expected to begin on november 30 and last at least three weeks .
if passed , the senate bill would be reconciled with the house version within a mediation committee in january before being forwarded to president obama for signing .
if so , the legislation would reshape the 2.5 trillion dollar us healthcare system , which accounts for one-sixth of the us economy .
subsidies would be offered to help low-income earners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats say there are " too many conflicting statements " coming out of tehran " the aim of the drill is to display iran 's combat readiness and military potential , " he added .
tehran has held such demonstrations in the past to warn would-be attackers of its military might .
the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .
there , it would be processed into fuel for tehran 's medical research reactor . " we urge iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations , " officials said in a statement after talks in brussels . however , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei , speaking in berlin on friday , said he did not believe iran had dismissed the offer outright .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .

it is thought that the attack was launched by dissident republicans intent on undermining the province 's fragile peace process .
a car crashed through barriers and onto the grounds of the supervisory northern ireland policing board in belfast 's dockland area on saturday evening .
two people were seen running away before the vehicle burst into flames , but failed to blow up .
the building , which was undamaged , is the headquarters of a cross-community panel that oversees police operations .
as such , it is a symbol of efforts to bring the uk-loyalist protestant and irish nationalist catholic communities together .
police on sunday said they had arrested two men near the border with ireland , suspected of being behind the failed attack .
sensitive time those responsible have been condemned for trying to derail peace negotiations , which are at a critical stage .
loyalist and nationalist politicians are currently at loggerheads over when responsibility for policing and justice should return to the province .
currently , those functions are carried out by politicians in london .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence between the protestant and catholic communities haunted the province for decades " very clearly these people are trying to undermine the progress that has been made in northern ireland in recent years , " said britain 's northern ireland security minister paul goggins , " when attacks like these happen , it brings people together with the strong message that these dissidents will not succeed , " he said .
police said that they were doing everything possible to stop attacks .
" it is a reckless act , not just in doing damage but also the potential loss of life , " said northern ireland 's police chief , matt baggott .
" this attack is an attack on the well-being of everybody in northern ireland , " he said .
flare-up of violence northern ireland was troubled by violence between catholic and protestant communities for three decades before the good friday agreement in 1998 ushered in a period of relative peace .
but two british soldiers and a police officer were killed in march this year , highlighting the renewed threat posed by dissident paramilitary groups .
earlier this month , the independent monitoring commission said the danger posed by militant splinter groups was " very serious . "
in a separate incident on saturday , gunmen ambushed and shot at police in a village on the border with the republic of ireland .
no police were hurt and three people were arrested. rc / ap / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats say there are " too many conflicting statements " coming out of tehran " the aim of the drill is to display iran 's combat readiness and military potential , " he added .
tehran has held such demonstrations in the past to warn would-be attackers of its military might .
the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .
there , it would be processed into fuel for tehran 's medical research reactor . " we urge iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations , " officials said in a statement after talks in brussels . however , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei , speaking in berlin on friday , said he did not believe iran had dismissed the offer outright . " the ball is now in iran 's court .
i hope they will not miss this fleeting chance , " he told reporters . vj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 22.11.2009 director david lynch unveils his art at surrealist museum großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emily scream # 1 , 2008 , photo film director lynch is famous for his eerie films like " lost highway " and " blue velvet . "
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 czechs discover lure of shopping malls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square is also a popular shopping destination since the fall of communism , czechs have taken to western-style consumer culture with great enthusiasm .
but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 czechs discover lure of shopping malls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prague 's wenceslas square is also a popular shopping destination since the fall of communism , czechs have taken to western-style consumer culture with great enthusiasm .
but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .

the attack highlights the danger dissident militant groups still present . a potentially devastating bomb attack on a police headquarters in belfast , northern ireland on saturday night failed when a massive car bomb did not detonate fully . on sunday , police said the 180-kilogram -lrb- 400-pound -rrb- device would have caused " widespread destruction " had it functioned as planned .
it is thought that the attack was launched by dissident republicans intent on undermining the province 's fragile peace process .
a car crashed through barriers and onto the grounds of the supervisory northern ireland policing board in belfast 's dockland area on saturday evening .
two people were seen running away before the vehicle burst into flames , but failed to blow up .
the building , which was undamaged , is the headquarters of a cross-community panel that oversees police operations .

now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

the white house said obama looked forward to " thorough " debate on his top domestic initiative . senators voted 60-39 to formally debate obama 's top priority plan to extend healthcare coverage to some 31 million american uninsured and bar insurers from denying coverage to those with existing illnesses .
the house of representatives had narrowly passed its own version on november 7 . the senate debate itself is expected to begin on november 30 and last at least three weeks .
if passed , the senate bill would be reconciled with the house version within a mediation committee in january before being forwarded to president obama for signing .
if so , the legislation would reshape the 2.5 trillion dollar us healthcare system , which accounts for one-sixth of the us economy .
subsidies would be offered to help low-income earners .

tehran recently rejected a deal by the un security council to ship its enriched uranium abroad . iranian armed forces are conducting five days of war games involving simulated attacks on the country 's nuclear sites , state-owned press tv and al-alam television channels reported .
the simulations are intended to show off iran 's defense capabilities amid increasing pressure from the west over its uranium enrichment program .
tehran has long denied accusations that it intends to use its program to produce nuclear weapons .
" due to the threats against our nuclear facilities it is our duty to defend our nation 's vital facilities and thus this maneuver covers bushehr , fars , isfahan , tehran and western provinces , " said brigadier general ahmad mighani , the head of army air defense , on saturday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats say there are " too many conflicting statements " coming out of tehran " the aim of the drill is to display iran 's combat readiness and military potential , " he added .
tehran has held such demonstrations in the past to warn would-be attackers of its military might .
the us and israel say they are seeking a diplomatic solution to the nuclear standoff , but maintain that military force is an option if all else fails . iran has warned of a " crushing " response to any military action against its nuclear facilities , saying it will hit back at israel and us interests in the region if it is attacked .
iran rejects un deal on friday , the un security council plus germany expressed disappointment at iran 's rejection of a compromise deal which would have allowed iran to ship its low-grade enriched uranium to france and russia .
there , it would be processed into fuel for tehran 's medical research reactor . " we urge iran to reconsider the opportunity offered by this agreement to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to engage seriously with us in dialogue and negotiations , " officials said in a statement after talks in brussels . however , iaea chief mohamed elbaradei , speaking in berlin on friday , said he did not believe iran had dismissed the offer outright . " the ball is now in iran 's court .
i hope they will not miss this fleeting chance , " he told reporters . vj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

the white house said obama looked forward to " thorough " debate on his top domestic initiative . senators voted 60-39 to formally debate obama 's top priority plan to extend healthcare coverage to some 31 million american uninsured and bar insurers from denying coverage to those with existing illnesses .
the house of representatives had narrowly passed its own version on november 7 . the senate debate itself is expected to begin on november 30 and last at least three weeks .
if passed , the senate bill would be reconciled with the house version within a mediation committee in january before being forwarded to president obama for signing .
if so , the legislation would reshape the 2.5 trillion dollar us healthcare system , which accounts for one-sixth of the us economy .
subsidies would be offered to help low-income earners .

the holdouts , blanche lincoln and mary landrieu , moderates from conservative southern us states , said they still wanted changes to the final legislation , including cost safeguards for small businesses .
" more work needs to be done , " landrieu said , " before i can support this effort . "
she also pressed for more funds for medicaid , government health aid for the poor .
senate republicans vow tough debate republican senate leader mitch mcconnell said he would use whatever means he had to delay or block obama 's legislation as mid-term congressional elections approach in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican leader in senate , mitch mcconnell republicans say the package is a costly government intrusion into private lives and the commercial health sector .
but , democratic senate majority leader harry reid compared the health reform initiative to historic us decisions opposing slavery and upholding rights for women voters .
" we can see the finish line now , but we 're not there yet . "
white house says obama grateful white house spokesman robert gibbs said the " historic " senate vote had moved the usa closer to ending " insurance company abuses " and reining in spiraling health costs .

but it 's one change that not everyone is happy about . under communism , people in the czech republic had no choice but to accept long lines for even the most basic items , and almost zero variety .
but two decades after the velvet revolution , the country is awash with western-style shopping centers offering an abundance of goods .
take prague 's novy smichov shopping mall , for example .
on a sunday afternoon , the mall is bustling .
novy smichov has helped transform an area that , 20 years ago , was grimy and rundown .
according to retail market experts incoma research , the czech republic has the highest ratio of retail space per capita in central and eastern europe , with both large and smaller scale malls sprouting up in city centers and in the countryside in the past decade .
" one of the reasons why we have so many shopping centers here is that our regulations are not as strict as for example in the netherlands or the uk , " said tomas drtina of incoma .
" this enables developers to introduce more projects . ”
" in the very first wave in the late 1990s , there were mainly edge-of-town projects , large shopping centers incorporating a hypermarket plus a simple shopping mall , " he said .
" now the structure is much more differentiated .
we have retail parks , we have inner-city shopping malls , we have the first outlet centers .
we have interesting offers for all kinds of customers . "
consumption as a new way of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's been a boom in modern shopping centers across the czech republic palladium , a mall with around 200 shops , is located in a former army barracks a short walk from prague 's wenceslas square .
as one of the biggest , most modern shopping centers in the country , it 's perhaps the best example of how retail culture in the czech republic has changed since communism .
" it 's hard to imagine today , but -lrb- in the communist era -rrb- there were only three department stores - just stores , not shopping malls , " said jana ciglerova , a former editor of elle magazine .
" now , there are shopping centers pretty much everywhere.the change has been significant , not only in the luxury market but also in the mass market .
we now have all the main brands you would know from the rest of the world . "
but why have czechs embraced shopping and consumer culture so much more than their other central and eastern european neighbors ?
as was the case in other former communist bloc countries , people in the czech republic were exposed to an abundance of goods when the iron curtain fell .
" i remember the first times we went abroad to austria or germany , " ciglerova said .
" you just could n't believe what was in all the stores , you could not believe there were so many vegetables , and you could choose the color of your trousers or your sweaters . "
but the difference for most czechs , she believes , is that they can afford the choice .
" the overall economic situation of people in the czech republic has improved -lrb- since communism ended -rrb- , that 's what i would say . ”
indeed , the czech republic has the second-biggest economy after poland in the group of cee countries .
it 's also known to have a solid banking system and low debt .
in terms of the purchasing power of cee countries , the czech republic was second only to slovenia in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czechs were quick to embrace western-style consumerism school trips to shopping malls but not everyone thinks the country 's retail boom is a good thing .
czech filmmaker erika hnikova , for example , took a rather dim view of the new consumerism in her popular 2004 documentary , the beauty exchange .
" it 's bad in my opinion , because i think you can spend your life in a much more interesting way than going to a shopping center and spending your money , " hnikova said .
" people have got really used to going to these big shopping centers which were going up very quickly .
but i think that normal people , not intellectuals , are n't thinking about how this can influence them . ”
hnikova says that shopping centers have even become an unlikely tour destination .
" when you are at elementary school , you always have some trips , to see a historic castle or something .
but now it 's normal that kids from a small village are taken to visit a huge supermarket or a mall when they take a trip to prague , " she said .
as a result of the global economic downturn , the retail construction boom has slowed somewhat in the czech republic , though it is expected to pick up again in 2011 .
for the czechs , at least , it seems that consumer culture is here to stay .

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

the territory in question is the nagorno-karabakh enclave which has been under the control of armenian troops and ethnic armenian forces since 1994 .
" if that meeting ends without result , then our hopes in negotiations will be exhausted and then we are left with no other option , " aliyev said on saturday .
" we have the right to liberate our land by military means . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorno-karabakh is under armenian control since 1994 azerbaijan is aiming to strike a deal whereby most of the seven azeri districts captured during the war with armenia would be returned .
the meeting between armenia 's serzh sargsyan and azerbaijan 's ilham aliyev is due to take place at the residence of the french consul general and will be mediated by western diplomats .
if war were to erupt , it would threaten a key oil and gas transit region to the west .
it will be the sixth time the two leaders have met this year , and the first meeting since armenia normalized diplomatic ties with turkey after a century of hostility. vj / reuters / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

the attack highlights the danger dissident militant groups still present . a potentially devastating bomb attack on a police headquarters in belfast , northern ireland on saturday night failed when a massive car bomb did not detonate fully . on sunday , police said the 180-kilogram -lrb- 400-pound -rrb- device would have caused " widespread destruction " had it functioned as planned .
it is thought that the attack was launched by dissident republicans intent on undermining the province 's fragile peace process .
a car crashed through barriers and onto the grounds of the supervisory northern ireland policing board in belfast 's dockland area on saturday evening .
two people were seen running away before the vehicle burst into flames , but failed to blow up .
the building , which was undamaged , is the headquarters of a cross-community panel that oversees police operations .
as such , it is a symbol of efforts to bring the uk-loyalist protestant and irish nationalist catholic communities together .
police on sunday said they had arrested two men near the border with ireland , suspected of being behind the failed attack .
sensitive time those responsible have been condemned for trying to derail peace negotiations , which are at a critical stage .

but two british soldiers and a police officer were killed in march this year , highlighting the renewed threat posed by dissident paramilitary groups .
earlier this month , the independent monitoring commission said the danger posed by militant splinter groups was " very serious . "

"
few people know him as a painter and graphic artist .
now , a museum in germany has devoted an entire exhibition to his artworks . david lynch 's artworks in the " dark splendor " show at the max ernst museum in bruehl range from black-and-white photographs of snowmen to color pin-ups of women to intricate lithographs of nudes in compromising poses and tiny drawings of doorways on match-book covers - all of it underscored by spooky sounds .
in fact , it was painting that sparked his interest in film .
that interest led him to later create film cult classics like " eraserhead , " " blue velvet , " " twin peaks " and academy award-nominated " the elephant man . "
deutsche welle spoke with the artist about his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : self-portrait dw : the max ernst museum in bruehl is the first german museum ever to show your artworks .
why did you choose to show your art there ?
david lynch : max ernst was in the surrealist camp and i love surrealism and love absurdities .
but really , the real reason i 'm here is that werner spies -lsb- the curator -rsb- wanted to give me an exhibition .
i 'm here because this museum exists and it 's a great honor to have a show here .
what 's your connection to german culture ?
i 'm an american and they say america is the melting pot of the world .
i have german ancestry and have a connection that way .
i also share something else with germans - my love of building things .
germans can build so well -lsb- laughs -rsb- .
there are all sorts of different elements in the show - photographs , paintings , installations , lithographs , sound designs .
how are they connected - is there a theme running through all of them ?
there 's no theme .
ideas inspire a person to get up out of the chair and go do something .
so i always say that ideas tell you what to do and if you fall in love with them , then you find yourself translating those ideas to a medium , one medium or another .
it 's a thrilling thing for us human beings to catch ideas and then it leads to building something .
there are different things , like watercolors , still photography , there 's painting , there 's sculpture and photographs and manipulations of photographs .
there 's just an infinite world of things that are possible , but the ideas drive the boat .
you originally started out painting and moved on to film .
why ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : box of bees , 1989 – 90 i was sitting in a room in philadelphia in the pennsylvania academy of fine arts and i was working in my little cubicle and was painting a picture of a garden at night .
the painting was mostly black , and little green plants were coming out of the black , and i was sitting back , maybe having a smoke , and looking at this and from the painting came a wind and the green began to move , so i said " oh , a moving painting . " … and that lead to building something for the experimental sculpture and painting contest that was held at the end of every year .
so i built a big sculptured screen and made a one minute stop-motion loop and i projected this in a big room … it cost me so much to make - $ 200 - and it took me a long time to build , so i said that 's it , it 's too expensive and i 'm through with this experiment .
but a gentleman came out of the crowd and he asked me to make one for him and he gave me money , so it opened the door again and by the time i finished the thing for him , i had fallen in love with this new medium of cinema .
it would be putting it mildly to say that some people consider your work " dark . "
how do you describe it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled , from the " distorted nudes " series i describe it as ideas that came to me that i fell in love with .
i understand why people say it 's dark , but to me , there 's many things swimming and from reactions through the years , people , you know , they love to go into these worlds , and if it was just darkness and just negativity , i do n't think people would want to go in there .
there 's something else swimming there and i do n't know exactly what it is , but it 's kind of thrilling .
would you say there 's sense of mystery to it ?
there are mysteries , and i love mysteries , but everybody does , and there 's something that pulls .
cinema is tricky .
it has to pull and pull and pull , all the time .
it 's good to show a film to an audience before you finish it to test it to see if it 's working .
often , you have to make changes to keep that pull going .
so you can have all these ideas , but at the very end , you have to feel it with an audience , and those days are kind of going away .
when you see a film by yourself , in your house , it 's a different thing .
you 're more forgiving to films and you do n't have as much discipline anymore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : untitled innocence comes up in one form or another in your works , and you 've spoken about the beauty of children in being open to so many things .
can you name a few experiences as a child that turned you into the artist you are today ?
who knows ?
my childhood was like a dream - it was so incredible .
every day was thrilling to experience .
it was more or less a fascination with the world .

the territory in question is the nagorno-karabakh enclave which has been under the control of armenian troops and ethnic armenian forces since 1994 .
" if that meeting ends without result , then our hopes in negotiations will be exhausted and then we are left with no other option , " aliyev said on saturday .
" we have the right to liberate our land by military means . "

the meeting between armenia 's serzh sargsyan and azerbaijan 's ilham aliyev is due to take place at the residence of the french consul general and will be mediated by western diplomats .
if war were to erupt , it would threaten a key oil and gas transit region to the west .
it will be the sixth time the two leaders have met this year , and the first meeting since armenia normalized diplomatic ties with turkey after a century of hostility. vj / reuters / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.11.2009 postcard from europe : romanian countryside transformed by eu subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is rural life in romania changing too fast ?
eu subsidies to romania may be a blessing for the economy , but for rural life they 're a curse .
unemployment is skyrocketing and traditional architecture is disappearing at an alarming pace , writes dw 's william blacker . in the late 1980s , english newspapers were full of stories of how romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu was laying waste to the historic villages of romania .
there followed an international outcry against such brutal , architectural vandalism .
but then in the final days of 1989 , romania 's bloody revolution brought an abrupt end to it all .
ceausescu and his wife elena were led out into the backyard of a militia garrison in targoviste and shot dead .
by chance , two weeks later , i was travelling through eastern europe and found myself crossing the romanian border , where i expected to find a wasteland of bulldozed settlements .
instead i found villages more intact and more beautiful than any i had seen in all of eastern europe .
it was then i discovered that ceausescu 's plans to " systematize " the villages had never been carried out .
not only were the villages beautiful but they were also full of people , all of whom had jobs .
the land around the villages was neatly cultivated , there were thriving forests , and nowhere was there any sign of advertising or neon lights .
modern blundering now the communist cooperative farms have closed down , and to find work villagers are forced to travel abroad , often lured by false promises and ending up begging and working in prostitution .
the forests are being chopped down at a rate faster than at any time since world war ii - there is now 20 percent less forestland in romania than in 1989 - and the once pristine countryside is now littered not only with plastic , but also with advertising billboards and neon lights promoting the same western products which create that litter .
the modern world has blundered in with barely a thought for the consequences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blacker says the eu is demolishing romania 's historic villages those villagers who did n't go abroad to work have until now , with their few animals , managed to survive .
but this year the pace of change accelerated .
in august i watched as monstrous , eu financed machines rumbled though my village and headed for the hay meadows .
there they roared up and down spewing forth huge , cylindrical hay-bales .
one man operated each machine , and the jobs of 20 people , mostly sinti and roma , were gone in a moment .
the benign , small-scale agriculture upon which the villagers relied was brought ever nearer its end .
eu subsidies hurt the poor you might think the eu agricultural subsidies given directly to farmers are helping - and in a way they are - but they are given only to those who already have more than a certain amount of land or number of animals .
the smallest subsistence farmers receive nothing , and so , as ever , the rich get richer and the poor are squeezed out .
but there is a greater irony .
those lucky enough to receive eu subsidies , often pocketing large sums of money , are using them to modernize their 18th and 19th century village houses beyond all recognition , turning them into garish villas which bear no resemblance to the historic architecture around them .
for a tiny proportion of the money spent on subsidizing agriculture , the eu could have ensured that romania 's historic architecture was properly legally protected .
it did not .
the result is a creeping cultural catastrophe , and the destruction is on a scale far greater than anything ceausescu ever achieved .
ceausescu had wanted to destroy romania 's historic villages ; the modern world and the eu are now doing his work for him .

the uk border agency had said it believed the total number of students was " roughly the same " as last year .
but a freedom of information request revealed the numbers entering from those countries , thought to be hotspots for bogus students , has tripled .
the home office insists that the figures do not reflect a global trend .
' raise the bar ' the new points-based immigration system was introduced last year .
it was designed to be tougher and more selective than the old one .
the then home secretary jacqui smith promised that the new system would " raise the bar " and lead to " fewer migrants coming to the uk from outside the eu " .
but earlier this month , immigration officers told bbc radio 5 live they feared more bogus students are arriving in the uk under the new system , partly because of the large volume of arrivals which must be processed .
officers said a significant number of those arriving on student visas had previously been denied entry to the uk , and they suspected that many had come here to work and not study .
one heathrow-based whistleblower told the donal macintyre programme that many so-called students could not speak english , and knew nothing about the courses they claimed to be studying .
he said many of these students came from the indian subcontinent .
sharp increase responding to the immigration officers ' concerns , jeremy oppenheim , who runs the points-based system at the uk border agency , said that the number of students coming into the uk this year was " roughly the same as last year " .
but figures subsequently obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show there has been a sharp increase in the number of student visas granted in india and bangladesh - two of the biggest centres for non-eu student visa applications .
between june and august 2008 -lrb- before the new system for students came into force -rrb- , the british high commissions in mumbai , new delhi and dhaka issued 6,771 student visas .
during the same period this year -lrb- under the new points-based immigration system -rrb- , the three offices issued 19,950 visas .
the number of student visa applications rejected also rose from 3,997 to 6,261 .
' flexible ' the government says it has cracked down on bogus colleges , and that the number of institutions able to bring students into the uk from outside the european union has been halved since the introduction of the new points-based immigration system .
in a statement , mr oppenheim told the donal macintyre programme : " the uk border agency has 74 visa-issuing posts worldwide , so three cities should not be taken as representative of a global trend .
" the points-based system is designed to be flexible , " he added .
" it enables us to regularly check and monitor all student applications and colleges to ensure that they meet the required standards , and take action where necessary . "

advertisement one immigration officer filmed lengthy immigration queues at heathrow the number of students entering the uk from india and bangladesh has risen sharply since a new visa system began , the bbc has learned .
the uk border agency had said it believed the total number of students was " roughly the same " as last year .
but a freedom of information request revealed the numbers entering from those countries , thought to be hotspots for bogus students , has tripled .
the home office insists that the figures do not reflect a global trend .
' raise the bar ' the new points-based immigration system was introduced last year .
it was designed to be tougher and more selective than the old one .
the then home secretary jacqui smith promised that the new system would " raise the bar " and lead to " fewer migrants coming to the uk from outside the eu " .
but earlier this month , immigration officers told bbc radio 5 live they feared more bogus students are arriving in the uk under the new system , partly because of the large volume of arrivals which must be processed .
officers said a significant number of those arriving on student visas had previously been denied entry to the uk , and they suspected that many had come here to work and not study .
one heathrow-based whistleblower told the donal macintyre programme that many so-called students could not speak english , and knew nothing about the courses they claimed to be studying .
he said many of these students came from the indian subcontinent .
sharp increase responding to the immigration officers ' concerns , jeremy oppenheim , who runs the points-based system at the uk border agency , said that the number of students coming into the uk this year was " roughly the same as last year " .
but figures subsequently obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show there has been a sharp increase in the number of student visas granted in india and bangladesh - two of the biggest centres for non-eu student visa applications .
between june and august 2008 -lrb- before the new system for students came into force -rrb- , the british high commissions in mumbai , new delhi and dhaka issued 6,771 student visas .
during the same period this year -lrb- under the new points-based immigration system -rrb- , the three offices issued 19,950 visas .
the number of student visa applications rejected also rose from 3,997 to 6,261 .
' flexible ' the government says it has cracked down on bogus colleges , and that the number of institutions able to bring students into the uk from outside the european union has been halved since the introduction of the new points-based immigration system .
in a statement , mr oppenheim told the donal macintyre programme : " the uk border agency has 74 visa-issuing posts worldwide , so three cities should not be taken as representative of a global trend .
" the points-based system is designed to be flexible , " he added .
" it enables us to regularly check and monitor all student applications and colleges to ensure that they meet the required standards , and take action where necessary . "

advertisement one immigration officer filmed lengthy immigration queues at heathrow the number of students entering the uk from india and bangladesh has risen sharply since a new visa system began , the bbc has learned .
the uk border agency had said it believed the total number of students was " roughly the same " as last year .
but a freedom of information request revealed the numbers entering from those countries , thought to be hotspots for bogus students , has tripled .
the home office insists that the figures do not reflect a global trend .
' raise the bar ' the new points-based immigration system was introduced last year .
it was designed to be tougher and more selective than the old one .
the then home secretary jacqui smith promised that the new system would " raise the bar " and lead to " fewer migrants coming to the uk from outside the eu " .
but earlier this month , immigration officers told bbc radio 5 live they feared more bogus students are arriving in the uk under the new system , partly because of the large volume of arrivals which must be processed .
officers said a significant number of those arriving on student visas had previously been denied entry to the uk , and they suspected that many had come here to work and not study .
one heathrow-based whistleblower told the donal macintyre programme that many so-called students could not speak english , and knew nothing about the courses they claimed to be studying .
he said many of these students came from the indian subcontinent .
sharp increase responding to the immigration officers ' concerns , jeremy oppenheim , who runs the points-based system at the uk border agency , said that the number of students coming into the uk this year was " roughly the same as last year " .
but figures subsequently obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show there has been a sharp increase in the number of student visas granted in india and bangladesh - two of the biggest centres for non-eu student visa applications .
between june and august 2008 -lrb- before the new system for students came into force -rrb- , the british high commissions in mumbai , new delhi and dhaka issued 6,771 student visas .
during the same period this year -lrb- under the new points-based immigration system -rrb- , the three offices issued 19,950 visas .
the number of student visa applications rejected also rose from 3,997 to 6,261 .
' flexible ' the government says it has cracked down on bogus colleges , and that the number of institutions able to bring students into the uk from outside the european union has been halved since the introduction of the new points-based immigration system .
in a statement , mr oppenheim told the donal macintyre programme : " the uk border agency has 74 visa-issuing posts worldwide , so three cities should not be taken as representative of a global trend .
" the points-based system is designed to be flexible , " he added .
" it enables us to regularly check and monitor all student applications and colleges to ensure that they meet the required standards , and take action where necessary . "

advertisement one immigration officer filmed lengthy immigration queues at heathrow the number of students entering the uk from india and bangladesh has risen sharply since a new visa system began , the bbc has learned .
the uk border agency had said it believed the total number of students was " roughly the same " as last year .
but a freedom of information request revealed the numbers entering from those countries , thought to be hotspots for bogus students , has tripled .
the home office insists that the figures do not reflect a global trend .
' raise the bar ' the new points-based immigration system was introduced last year .
it was designed to be tougher and more selective than the old one .
the then home secretary jacqui smith promised that the new system would " raise the bar " and lead to " fewer migrants coming to the uk from outside the eu " .
but earlier this month , immigration officers told bbc radio 5 live they feared more bogus students are arriving in the uk under the new system , partly because of the large volume of arrivals which must be processed .
officers said a significant number of those arriving on student visas had previously been denied entry to the uk , and they suspected that many had come here to work and not study .
one heathrow-based whistleblower told the donal macintyre programme that many so-called students could not speak english , and knew nothing about the courses they claimed to be studying .
he said many of these students came from the indian subcontinent .
sharp increase responding to the immigration officers ' concerns , jeremy oppenheim , who runs the points-based system at the uk border agency , said that the number of students coming into the uk this year was " roughly the same as last year " .
but figures subsequently obtained by the bbc under the freedom of information act show there has been a sharp increase in the number of student visas granted in india and bangladesh - two of the biggest centres for non-eu student visa applications .
between june and august 2008 -lrb- before the new system for students came into force -rrb- , the british high commissions in mumbai , new delhi and dhaka issued 6,771 student visas .
during the same period this year -lrb- under the new points-based immigration system -rrb- , the three offices issued 19,950 visas .
the number of student visa applications rejected also rose from 3,997 to 6,261 .
' flexible ' the government says it has cracked down on bogus colleges , and that the number of institutions able to bring students into the uk from outside the european union has been halved since the introduction of the new points-based immigration system .
in a statement , mr oppenheim told the donal macintyre programme : " the uk border agency has 74 visa-issuing posts worldwide , so three cities should not be taken as representative of a global trend .
" the points-based system is designed to be flexible , " he added .

by hannah barnes donal macintyre show , bbc radio 5 live it is thought the military have also sought assistance from psychics " quite often the victim in the spirit world will come to me and they often lead you to the name or the person involved in their murder . "
joe power is a psychic medium who has worked with several uk forces trying to solve tough cases .
when asked if he has helped the police solve murders , there is no hesitation : " without a shadow of a doubt , " he says .
when the bbc approached the metropolitan and merseyside police forces they were vague about any dealings with joe .
merseyside said they could not confirm or deny that they had followed up on his information , or that they had actively contacted him a spokesperson for the met said : " we welcome any information from people who feel they are able to assist .
" we are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium . "
a common pattern the bbc has approached a number of police forces after speaking to psychics who claim that their information has been acted upon .
the vast majority are ambiguous in their response .
but there is no denying that some individual officers are pursuing leads that have arisen from someone professing to have paranormal powers .
i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
joe power , psychic medium earlier this month it emerged that dyfed powys police had spent £ 20,000 following a line of investigation in a murder inquiry , based on information passed on by a medium .
the welsh force was widely criticised for wasting taxpayers ' money .
joe power says that he was contacted by the metropolitan police , asking for assistance on a very high profile murder investigation .
" i got an e-mail from the met police asking for assistance , " joe power insists .
" i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
without a doubt they followed up on it . "
in an initial statement , the metropolitan police denied joe had any involvement in the case .
major investigation however , the donal macintyre programme has seen an e-mail which mr power claims was sent to his partner by an officer working on the case .
the officer writes , " can joe or the victim assist with any landmarks that would assist in narrowing the search down ? "
joe is also asked " what sort of vehicle does the killer use , is it a car or a bike ?
can the victim be more specific to joe as to what happened at 2.10 ? "
when approached for a second time about joe power 's involvement with the case , the metropolitan police issued a new statement , authorised by the senior investigating officer .
it said : " we do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with enquiries .
we are not prepared to discuss this further . "
this reluctance to be open is something keith charles can relate to .
some psychics say police are not honest about their work with mediums a former scotland yard man who now practises as a medium , he says : " i think the police are sceptical , but they have a right to be so because some mediums and psychics make false claims . "
" but , ultimately officers do n't mind where the evidence comes from as long as it proves or disproves the case . "
wasting police time however , there are plenty who believe that there is no place at all for so-called psychic mediums in police work .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe from derby university has conducted research into psychic detection for 10 years and says , " there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information . "
" my advice to psychics is to stop providing information to the police , " he says .
explaining that it is difficult for officers to ignore information , dr o 'keeffe claims that details passed on by psychic mediums are simply " diverting budget and man power away from genuine investigation . "
it is not just within policing that the uk shies away from any mention of involvement with the paranormal .
in 2007 the ministry of defence was forced to admit that it had spent £ 18,000 carrying out secret tests to find out whether psychic powers could be used to detect hidden objects .
at the time a spokesperson for the mod said that the study had found that there was " little value " in using the technique in the defence of the nation .
there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe , derby university the us military has experimented on a much larger scale with their stargate project , which investigated whether ' remote viewing ' - the ability to psychically ' see ' people and objects from great distances - could be used for potential military purposes .
some believers have even gone as far to say that us authorities deployed the technique to search for osama bin laden .
lack of recognition but for psychic mediums in the uk , the willingness of police officers to use their information , but not publicly acknowledge them , can be frustrating .
angela mcghee has also contributed information towards an active murder inquiry .
west midlands police told the bbc that " officers interviewed angela mcghee as we would anyone offering information about any offence .
" but she did not have any evidence that was not already known to the investigative team . "

"
while police forces across the uk refuse to either confirm or deny their use of psychics in major investigations , it is difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is .
but joe power is in no doubt that he and others will continue to play a role in solving crime : " i predict that in the next 30 to 40 years you will actually get people like me who will find bodies , where there 's no question about it .
" the psychic world is moving on very fast and it 's getting more accurate with the information all the time . "

by hannah barnes donal macintyre show , bbc radio 5 live it is thought the military have also sought assistance from psychics " quite often the victim in the spirit world will come to me and they often lead you to the name or the person involved in their murder . "
joe power is a psychic medium who has worked with several uk forces trying to solve tough cases .
when asked if he has helped the police solve murders , there is no hesitation : " without a shadow of a doubt , " he says .
when the bbc approached the metropolitan and merseyside police forces they were vague about any dealings with joe .
merseyside said they could not confirm or deny that they had followed up on his information , or that they had actively contacted him a spokesperson for the met said : " we welcome any information from people who feel they are able to assist .
" we are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium . "
a common pattern the bbc has approached a number of police forces after speaking to psychics who claim that their information has been acted upon .
the vast majority are ambiguous in their response .
but there is no denying that some individual officers are pursuing leads that have arisen from someone professing to have paranormal powers .
i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
joe power , psychic medium earlier this month it emerged that dyfed powys police had spent £ 20,000 following a line of investigation in a murder inquiry , based on information passed on by a medium .
the welsh force was widely criticised for wasting taxpayers ' money .
joe power says that he was contacted by the metropolitan police , asking for assistance on a very high profile murder investigation .
" i got an e-mail from the met police asking for assistance , " joe power insists .
" i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
without a doubt they followed up on it . "
in an initial statement , the metropolitan police denied joe had any involvement in the case .
major investigation however , the donal macintyre programme has seen an e-mail which mr power claims was sent to his partner by an officer working on the case .
the officer writes , " can joe or the victim assist with any landmarks that would assist in narrowing the search down ? "
joe is also asked " what sort of vehicle does the killer use , is it a car or a bike ?
can the victim be more specific to joe as to what happened at 2.10 ? "
when approached for a second time about joe power 's involvement with the case , the metropolitan police issued a new statement , authorised by the senior investigating officer .
it said : " we do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with enquiries .
we are not prepared to discuss this further . "
this reluctance to be open is something keith charles can relate to .
some psychics say police are not honest about their work with mediums a former scotland yard man who now practises as a medium , he says : " i think the police are sceptical , but they have a right to be so because some mediums and psychics make false claims . "
" but , ultimately officers do n't mind where the evidence comes from as long as it proves or disproves the case . "
wasting police time however , there are plenty who believe that there is no place at all for so-called psychic mediums in police work .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe from derby university has conducted research into psychic detection for 10 years and says , " there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information . "
" my advice to psychics is to stop providing information to the police , " he says .
explaining that it is difficult for officers to ignore information , dr o 'keeffe claims that details passed on by psychic mediums are simply " diverting budget and man power away from genuine investigation . "
it is not just within policing that the uk shies away from any mention of involvement with the paranormal .
in 2007 the ministry of defence was forced to admit that it had spent £ 18,000 carrying out secret tests to find out whether psychic powers could be used to detect hidden objects .
at the time a spokesperson for the mod said that the study had found that there was " little value " in using the technique in the defence of the nation .
there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe , derby university the us military has experimented on a much larger scale with their stargate project , which investigated whether ' remote viewing ' - the ability to psychically ' see ' people and objects from great distances - could be used for potential military purposes .
some believers have even gone as far to say that us authorities deployed the technique to search for osama bin laden .
lack of recognition but for psychic mediums in the uk , the willingness of police officers to use their information , but not publicly acknowledge them , can be frustrating .
angela mcghee has also contributed information towards an active murder inquiry .
west midlands police told the bbc that " officers interviewed angela mcghee as we would anyone offering information about any offence .

while police forces across the uk refuse to either confirm or deny their use of psychics in major investigations , it is difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is .
but joe power is in no doubt that he and others will continue to play a role in solving crime : " i predict that in the next 30 to 40 years you will actually get people like me who will find bodies , where there 's no question about it .

by hannah barnes donal macintyre show , bbc radio 5 live it is thought the military have also sought assistance from psychics " quite often the victim in the spirit world will come to me and they often lead you to the name or the person involved in their murder . "
joe power is a psychic medium who has worked with several uk forces trying to solve tough cases .
when asked if he has helped the police solve murders , there is no hesitation : " without a shadow of a doubt , " he says .
when the bbc approached the metropolitan and merseyside police forces they were vague about any dealings with joe .
merseyside said they could not confirm or deny that they had followed up on his information , or that they had actively contacted him a spokesperson for the met said : " we welcome any information from people who feel they are able to assist .
" we are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium . "
a common pattern the bbc has approached a number of police forces after speaking to psychics who claim that their information has been acted upon .
the vast majority are ambiguous in their response .
but there is no denying that some individual officers are pursuing leads that have arisen from someone professing to have paranormal powers .
i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
joe power , psychic medium earlier this month it emerged that dyfed powys police had spent £ 20,000 following a line of investigation in a murder inquiry , based on information passed on by a medium .
the welsh force was widely criticised for wasting taxpayers ' money .
joe power says that he was contacted by the metropolitan police , asking for assistance on a very high profile murder investigation .
" i got an e-mail from the met police asking for assistance , " joe power insists .
" i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
without a doubt they followed up on it . "
in an initial statement , the metropolitan police denied joe had any involvement in the case .
major investigation however , the donal macintyre programme has seen an e-mail which mr power claims was sent to his partner by an officer working on the case .
the officer writes , " can joe or the victim assist with any landmarks that would assist in narrowing the search down ? "
joe is also asked " what sort of vehicle does the killer use , is it a car or a bike ?
can the victim be more specific to joe as to what happened at 2.10 ? "
when approached for a second time about joe power 's involvement with the case , the metropolitan police issued a new statement , authorised by the senior investigating officer .
it said : " we do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with enquiries .
we are not prepared to discuss this further . "
this reluctance to be open is something keith charles can relate to .
some psychics say police are not honest about their work with mediums a former scotland yard man who now practises as a medium , he says : " i think the police are sceptical , but they have a right to be so because some mediums and psychics make false claims . "
" but , ultimately officers do n't mind where the evidence comes from as long as it proves or disproves the case . "
wasting police time however , there are plenty who believe that there is no place at all for so-called psychic mediums in police work .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe from derby university has conducted research into psychic detection for 10 years and says , " there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information . "
" my advice to psychics is to stop providing information to the police , " he says .
explaining that it is difficult for officers to ignore information , dr o 'keeffe claims that details passed on by psychic mediums are simply " diverting budget and man power away from genuine investigation . "
it is not just within policing that the uk shies away from any mention of involvement with the paranormal .
in 2007 the ministry of defence was forced to admit that it had spent £ 18,000 carrying out secret tests to find out whether psychic powers could be used to detect hidden objects .
at the time a spokesperson for the mod said that the study had found that there was " little value " in using the technique in the defence of the nation .
there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe , derby university the us military has experimented on a much larger scale with their stargate project , which investigated whether ' remote viewing ' - the ability to psychically ' see ' people and objects from great distances - could be used for potential military purposes .
some believers have even gone as far to say that us authorities deployed the technique to search for osama bin laden .
lack of recognition but for psychic mediums in the uk , the willingness of police officers to use their information , but not publicly acknowledge them , can be frustrating .
angela mcghee has also contributed information towards an active murder inquiry .
west midlands police told the bbc that " officers interviewed angela mcghee as we would anyone offering information about any offence .

while police forces across the uk refuse to either confirm or deny their use of psychics in major investigations , it is difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is .
but joe power is in no doubt that he and others will continue to play a role in solving crime : " i predict that in the next 30 to 40 years you will actually get people like me who will find bodies , where there 's no question about it .

by hannah barnes donal macintyre show , bbc radio 5 live " quite often the victim in the spirit world will come to me and they often lead you to the name or the person involved in their murder . "
joe power is a psychic medium who has worked with several uk forces trying to solve tough cases .
when asked if he has helped the police solve murders , there is no hesitation : " without a shadow of a doubt , " he says .
when the bbc approached the metropolitan and merseyside police forces they were vague about any dealings with joe .
merseyside said they could not confirm or deny that they had followed up on his information , or that they had actively contacted him a spokesperson for the met said : " we welcome any information from people who feel they are able to assist .
" we are unaware of any inquiries significantly progressed solely by information provided by a psychic medium . "
a common pattern the bbc has approached a number of police forces after speaking to psychics who claim that their information has been acted upon .
the vast majority are ambiguous in their response .
but there is no denying that some individual officers are pursuing leads that have arisen from someone professing to have paranormal powers . "
i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side . "
joe power , psychic medium earlier this month it emerged that dyfed powys police had spent £ 20,000 following a line of investigation in a murder inquiry , based on information passed on by a medium .
the welsh force was widely criticised for wasting taxpayers ' money .
joe power says that he was contacted by the metropolitan police , asking for assistance on a very high profile murder investigation .
" i got an e-mail from the met police asking for assistance , " joe power insists .
" i gave them some information that was coming through the murder victim and people on the other side .
without a doubt they followed up on it . "
in an initial statement , the metropolitan police denied joe had any involvement in the case .
major investigation however , the donal macintyre programme has seen an e-mail which mr power claims was sent to his partner by an officer working on the case .
the officer writes , " can joe or the victim assist with any landmarks that would assist in narrowing the search down ? "
joe is also asked " what sort of vehicle does the killer use , is it a car or a bike ?
can the victim be more specific to joe as to what happened at 2.10 ? "
when approached for a second time about joe power 's involvement with the case , the metropolitan police issued a new statement , authorised by the senior investigating officer .
it said : " we do not identify people we may or may not speak with in connection with enquiries .
we are not prepared to discuss this further . "
this reluctance to be open is something keith charles can relate to .
a former scotland yard man who now practises as a medium , he says : " i think the police are sceptical , but they have a right to be so because some mediums and psychics make false claims . "
" but , ultimately officers do n't mind where the evidence comes from as long as it proves or disproves the case . "
wasting police time however , there are plenty who believe that there is no place at all for so-called psychic mediums in police work .
dr ciaran o 'keeffe from derby university has conducted research into psychic detection for 10 years and says , " there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information . "
" my advice to psychics is to stop providing information to the police , " he says .
explaining that it is difficult for officers to ignore information , dr o 'keeffe claims that details passed on by psychic mediums are simply " diverting budget and man power away from genuine investigation . "
it is not just within policing that the uk shies away from any mention of involvement with the paranormal .
in 2007 the ministry of defence was forced to admit that it had spent £ 18,000 carrying out secret tests to find out whether psychic powers could be used to detect hidden objects . "
there is n't any scientific evidence for psychic detectives being able to provide accurate information . "
dr ciaran o 'keeffe , derby university the us military has experimented on a much larger scale with their stargate project , which investigated whether ' remote viewing ' - the ability to psychically ' see ' people and objects from great distances - could be used for potential military purposes .
some believers have even gone as far to say that us authorities deployed the technique to search for osama bin laden .
lack of recognition but for psychic mediums in the uk , the willingness of police officers to use their information , but not publicly acknowledge them , can be frustrating .
angela mcghee has also contributed information towards an active murder inquiry .
west midlands police told the bbc that " officers interviewed angela mcghee as we would anyone offering information about any offence .
" but she did not have any evidence that was not already known to the investigative team . "

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- us senate approves health debate bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 06:12 gmt , sunday , 22 november 2009 us senate approves health debate the us senate has narrowly voted to hold a full debate on a landmark bill designed to overhaul the country 's healthcare .
all 58 democrats , plus two independent senators , approved it .
all but one of 40 republican senators voted against .
two democratic senators whose support had been in doubt earlier said they would back the package , a key election pledge of president barack obama .
the white house said mr obama was " gratified " by the result .
a full senate debate on healthcare reform will now begin on 30 november . "
we 're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent this measure from becoming law " mitch mcconnell republican senate leader q & a : us healthcare reform us healthcare : who wants what ?
the house of representatives narrowly passed its own version of the reforms earlier this month .
the legislation - designed to secure coverage for millions of uninsured americans - could lead to the biggest changes in us healthcare in decades , if approved .
senate democratic leader harry reid says his $ 849bn -lrb- £ 508bn -rrb- bill would extend coverage to another 31 million people , or 94 % of eligible citizens .
the legislation , which was outlined in a 2,074-page document , is said by democratic aides to reduce deficits by $ 127bn -lrb- £ 76bn -rrb- over a decade and by as much as $ 650bn -lrb- £ 389bn -rrb- in the 10 years after that .
' historic ' but republicans say it will be too expensive , and have vowed to block it .
fewer than 60 votes for the initial measure would have left the bill vulnerable to republican delaying tactics .
next steps 30 nov - senators return from thanksgiving recess to debate and propose amendments to the bill at least three weeks later - senators vote on final bill if passed , conference committee set up to reconcile senate and house bills both chambers vote on final version if passed , president obama signs bill into law q & a : us healthcare reform the us health system ' headache ' us healthcare : who wants what ?
a white house spokesman said president obama was " gratified that the senate has acted to begin consideration of health insurance reform legislation " .
" tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiralling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance , and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , " said robert gibbs .
speaking after the vote , mr reid said he was looking forward to the coming debate and to " finally bringing quality health care to the american people " .
but republican senate leader mitch mcconnell said he would continue to oppose the motion .
" the american people are asking us to stop this bill and we 're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent this measure from becoming law , " he said .
efforts to get the vote passed had focused on three centrist democrats - ben nelson of nebraska , blanche lincoln of arkansas and mary landrieu of louisiana - who expressed doubts about the bill .
sen nelson said on friday he would back the procedural vote , but senators lincoln and landrieu declared themselves available only hours before it was due to take place .
' deep reservations ' after confirming her support , sen lincoln said that it was important to start debating the issue and that saturday 's vote would " mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the us senate , not the end " .
senator landrieu said there were " enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward , but much more work needs to be done " .
all three democrats continue to have deep reservations about the bill .
under the senate bill , most americans would have to have health insurance , while private insurers would be banned from refusing to provide insurance because applicants had pre-existing medical conditions .
insurance would be made more affordable with subsidies available to help those in lower income bands , the democrats say .
people would also be able to take part in new insurance market places and be able to choose to buy government-sold insurance from 2014 , a provision intended to help regulate the prices charged by private companies .
large companies would be required by law to provide coverage to staff .
the costs would be covered by government cuts on future medicare spending .
if the senate eventually passes its bill , it must then be reconciled with the house of representatives bill and voted on again before the programme can become law .
mr reid 's bill differs to the house bill in that he calls for an increase of a half percentage point in medicare payroll tax for people with an income of over $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 119,779 -rrb- per annum - rising to $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 149,724 -rrb- for couples .
there is also a tax on high-value insurance policies that is not contained in the house version of the bill .

the legislation - designed to secure coverage for millions of uninsured americans - could lead to the biggest changes in us healthcare in decades , if approved .
senate democratic leader harry reid says his $ 849bn -lrb- £ 508bn -rrb- bill would extend coverage to another 31 million people , or 94 % of eligible citizens .
the legislation , which was outlined in a 2,074-page document , is said by democratic aides to reduce deficits by $ 127bn -lrb- £ 76bn -rrb- over a decade and by as much as $ 650bn -lrb- £ 389bn -rrb- in the 10 years after that .
' historic ' but republicans say it will be too expensive , and have vowed to block it .
fewer than 60 votes for the initial measure would have left the bill vulnerable to republican delaying tactics .
next steps 30 nov - senators return from thanksgiving recess to debate and propose amendments to the bill at least three weeks later - senators vote on final bill if passed , conference committee set up to reconcile senate and house bills both chambers vote on final version if passed , president obama signs bill into law q & a : us healthcare reform the us health system ' headache ' us healthcare : who wants what ?
a white house spokesman said president obama was " gratified that the senate has acted to begin consideration of health insurance reform legislation " .
" tonight 's historic vote brings us one step closer to ending insurance company abuses , reining in spiralling health care costs , providing stability and security to those with health insurance , and extending quality health coverage to those who lack it , " said robert gibbs .
speaking after the vote , mr reid said he was looking forward to the coming debate and to " finally bringing quality health care to the american people " .
but republican senate leader mitch mcconnell said he would continue to oppose the motion .
" the american people are asking us to stop this bill and we 're going to do anything and everything we can to prevent this measure from becoming law , " he said .
efforts to get the vote passed had focused on three centrist democrats - ben nelson of nebraska , blanche lincoln of arkansas and mary landrieu of louisiana - who expressed doubts about the bill .
sen nelson said on friday he would back the procedural vote , but senators lincoln and landrieu declared themselves available only hours before it was due to take place .
' deep reservations ' after confirming her support , sen lincoln said that it was important to start debating the issue and that saturday 's vote would " mark the beginning of consideration of this bill by the us senate , not the end " .
senator landrieu said there were " enough significant reforms and safeguards in this bill to move forward , but much more work needs to be done " .
all three democrats continue to have deep reservations about the bill .
the bill will face stiff opposition inside and outside congress under the senate bill , most americans would have to have health insurance , while private insurers would be banned from refusing to provide insurance because applicants had pre-existing medical conditions .
insurance would be made more affordable with subsidies available to help those in lower income bands , the democrats say .
people would also be able to take part in new insurance market places and be able to choose to buy government-sold insurance from 2014 , a provision intended to help regulate the prices charged by private companies .
large companies would be required by law to provide coverage to staff .
the costs would be covered by government cuts on future medicare spending .
if the senate eventually passes its bill , it must then be reconciled with the house of representatives bill and voted on again before the programme can become law .
mr reid 's bill differs to the house bill in that he calls for an increase of a half percentage point in medicare payroll tax for people with an income of over $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 119,779 -rrb- per annum - rising to $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 149,724 -rrb- for couples .
there is also a tax on high-value insurance policies that is not contained in the house version of the bill .

many of them were written by army officers , who are said to have " vented their frustration and anger with ministers and whitehall officials " .
the paper says it is publishing the material to ensure the failures in planning are never repeated .
" sunlight , after all , is the best disinfectant , " it says .
' save the cheque ' an observer opinion poll suggests the tories ' lead is shrinking , boosting labour 's hopes of a " great escape " .
the ipsos mori poll puts the conservatives on 37 % and labour on 31 % - the narrowest margin , according to the paper , since last december .
the sunday times says banks may scrap cheques as they cost four times more to process than electronic payments .
the number written fell by two-thirds in 20 years but the paper says groups may campaign to " save the cheque " .
' inherit the earth ' there is much debate in the papers about the appointment of the belgian pm and lady ashton to europe 's top jobs .
the mail on sunday claims lady ashton 's appointment as high representative for foreign affairs was forced on britain , as france and germany are said to feel they can exert control over her .
the ministry of defence finds itself in the sights of the people for the money it has spent on ceremonial uniforms .
the paper reckons more than £ 4m has been forked out in the past five years on new bearskins , red tunics and white gloves for the brigade of guards while troops in afghanistan complain of equipment shortages .
grandma song the sunday mirror reports that 10 servicewomen have been flown home from afghanistan in the past six months because they have become pregnant .

fourteen ex-members of st winifred 's school choir have re-recorded " there 's no one quite like grandma " .

many of them were written by army officers , who are said to have " vented their frustration and anger with ministers and whitehall officials " .
the paper says it is publishing the material to ensure the failures in planning are never repeated .
" sunlight , after all , is the best disinfectant , " it says .
' save the cheque ' an observer opinion poll suggests the tories ' lead is shrinking , boosting labour 's hopes of a " great escape " .
the ipsos mori poll puts the conservatives on 37 % and labour on 31 % - the narrowest margin , according to the paper , since last december .
the sunday times says banks may scrap cheques as they cost four times more to process than electronic payments .
the number written fell by two-thirds in 20 years but the paper says groups may campaign to " save the cheque " .
' inherit the earth ' there is much debate in the papers about the appointment of the belgian pm and lady ashton to europe 's top jobs .
the mail on sunday claims lady ashton 's appointment as high representative for foreign affairs was forced on britain , as france and germany are said to feel they can exert control over her .
the ministry of defence finds itself in the sights of the people for the money it has spent on ceremonial uniforms .
the paper reckons more than £ 4m has been forked out in the past five years on new bearskins , red tunics and white gloves for the brigade of guards while troops in afghanistan complain of equipment shortages .
grandma song the sunday mirror reports that 10 servicewomen have been flown home from afghanistan in the past six months because they have become pregnant .
finally , a song the sunday telegraph says inspires " affection and loathing " in equal measure is released on monday .
fourteen ex-members of st winifred 's school choir have re-recorded " there 's no one quite like grandma " .
the original sold one million copies in 1980 but has been a regular feature of " worst song " compilations ever since .

israel 's military said the attacks targeted two weapons-making factories and a smuggling tunnel .
the strikes were in retaliation for a rocket fired into southern israel from the hamas-controlled enclave , it added .
the attacks came a day after hamas and other gaza-based militants said they were going to stop firing rockets .
fathi hammad , who acts as hamas interior minister , said the ceasefire aimed to prevent retaliatory attacks by israel and build stability .
but he said rockets would continue to be fired from the gaza strip in the event of any israeli incursions .
sporadic attacks israel 's military said sunday 's air strikes were in response to a rocket fired from the gaza strip on saturday which caused no damage when it landed near the southern israeli city of sderot .
hamas has observed a ceasefire for months , but other groups have carried out sporadic cross-border attacks .
israel says rocket-building materials are still being smuggled into gaza through tunnels dug from the egyptian border .
rocket attacks have decreased since israeli forces launched an offensive against hamas in the gaza strip last december and january .
about 1,300 palestinians and 10 israeli soldiers were killed in the three weeks of fighting .
three israeli citizens also died in rocket attacks during the operation .

israel 's military said the attacks targeted two weapons-making factories and a smuggling tunnel .
the strikes were in retaliation for a rocket fired into southern israel from the hamas-controlled enclave , it added .
the attacks came a day after hamas and other gaza-based militants said they were going to stop firing rockets .
fathi hammad , who acts as hamas interior minister , said the ceasefire aimed to prevent retaliatory attacks by israel and build stability .
but he said rockets would continue to be fired from the gaza strip in the event of any israeli incursions .
sporadic attacks israel 's military said sunday 's air strikes were in response to a rocket fired from the gaza strip on saturday which caused no damage when it landed near the southern israeli city of sderot .
hamas has observed a ceasefire for months , but other groups have carried out sporadic cross-border attacks .
israel says rocket-building materials are still being smuggled into gaza through tunnels dug from the egyptian border .
rocket attacks have decreased since israeli forces launched an offensive against hamas in the gaza strip last december and january .
about 1,300 palestinians and 10 israeli soldiers were killed in the three weeks of fighting .
three israeli citizens also died in rocket attacks during the operation .
