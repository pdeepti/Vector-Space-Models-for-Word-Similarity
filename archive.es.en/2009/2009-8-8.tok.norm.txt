program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .
but , guard wolfgang muecke does n't want people to think that life in prison is a walk in the park . " imprisonment is always tough , " he said .
" it 's the worst thing imaginable - at least here in germany . " renewed confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are printed by hand while working in the shop does help make the time in prison easier , it also gives the prisoners a sense of purpose , especially since part of the products ' proceeds go to the " weisser ring , " an organization that helps victims of crime .
it also fosters a sense of confidence among the prisoners - that what they are producing is recognized and in demand " outside . " ultimately , it helps prepare inmates for a life outside the prison and for a future without crime . mehmed , who prints t-shirts in the workshop , can attest to how the recognition has boosted his confidence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .

young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .

less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .

the owners paid 1.9-million-euro -lrb- $ 2.7 million -rrb- ransom to the pirates . the hansa stavanger , which was seized by somali pirates some four months ago off the horn of africa , was escorted to kenya by german navy frigate the brandenburg .
the container vessel 's 24 crew , including five germans , are all said to be in sound health , though they were to undergo medical checks once they had reached land .
prior to the ship 's docking , an official for the local shipping agent , inchcape , said the vessel had been " checked for live explosives , as one previous ship held by the pirates was found to have rpgs -lrb- rocket-propelled grenades -rrb- on it . "
peter benn , a spokesman for the european union 's atalanta anti-piracy mission , told german news agency dpa that german federal police would board the ship upon its arrival at the mombasa port .
he added that the vessel would be treated as a crime scene .
" the company has asked that the crew be left alone as they have gone through a traumatic ordeal , " benn added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 08.08.2009 marketing prison products helps inmates stay out of trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buttons produced " inside " for the " outside " a german prison has put inmates to work designing and marketing tongue-in-cheek fashion products .
the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .
but , guard wolfgang muecke does n't want people to think that life in prison is a walk in the park . " imprisonment is always tough , " he said .
" it 's the worst thing imaginable - at least here in germany . " renewed confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are printed by hand while working in the shop does help make the time in prison easier , it also gives the prisoners a sense of purpose , especially since part of the products ' proceeds go to the " weisser ring , " an organization that helps victims of crime .
it also fosters a sense of confidence among the prisoners - that what they are producing is recognized and in demand " outside . " ultimately , it helps prepare inmates for a life outside the prison and for a future without crime . mehmed , who prints t-shirts in the workshop , can attest to how the recognition has boosted his confidence .
he was permitted to go on vacation outside of the prison and while walking down the street he saw some santu fu t-shirts in a shop window . " i realized that some of that was my work , or from my colleagues , " he says .
" i was proud to get that public recognition . " bildunterschrift : t-shirts are packed into plastic and shipped to stores author : dirk schneider -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2009 german newspapers facing readership crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are newspaper readers a dying breed ?
germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .
but , guard wolfgang muecke does n't want people to think that life in prison is a walk in the park . " imprisonment is always tough , " he said .
" it 's the worst thing imaginable - at least here in germany .

the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .
but , guard wolfgang muecke does n't want people to think that life in prison is a walk in the park . " imprisonment is always tough , " he said .

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2009 german newspapers facing readership crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are newspaper readers a dying breed ?
germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

" our conclusion is : no damage has been done to the federal budget , " said a spokesman for the office , and added that schmidt had correctly declared her use of the car on her tax return .
the story first came to light when her limousine was reported stolen in the spanish town of alicante .
opposition politicians were outraged that she would drive her car some 2,500 kilometers to spain , calling it a waste of taxpayers ' money .
when the situation first came to light , the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- dropped her from the party 's shadow cabinet fearing she would be a liability for the upcoming elections at the end of september .
however , a statement released by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that since the definition of the audit office was clear and definite , he was re-instating her as part of his team .
the spd party has experienced a drop in opinion poll ratings in recent weeks after the affair came to light .

for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .

financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination .

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has pleaded for clemency from the clerical leadership as a second round of trials begins in the iranian capital . clotilde reiss , the french lecturer who was put on trial on saturday , told the court she participated in post-election protests in iran , but added that it was a " mistake , " official media has reported .
" my motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
but i accept that it was a mistake and i should not have gone to these gatherings , " reiss told a revolutionary court in tehran , according to the state irna news agency .
reiss , who was in the country to teach french , has been charged with acting against the country 's national security for being involved in unrest after the disputed june 12 presidential vote .
she allegedly took a photograph of one of the riots and emailed it to a friend in tehran .
she was arrested by iranian authorities while trying to board her plane back home on july 1 .
also on trial are two employees of the french and british governments .
nazak afshar , who works for the french embassy , told a tehran court on saturday that she and other staffers had been told to offer shelter to protesters if required , the official irna news agency said .
" in the event that confrontations occurred in front of the cultural department of the embassy , we were told to offer refuge to protesters if they asked , " afshar told the court .

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 08.08.2009 marketing prison products helps inmates stay out of trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buttons produced " inside " for the " outside " a german prison has put inmates to work designing and marketing tongue-in-cheek fashion products .
the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2009 german newspapers facing readership crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are newspaper readers a dying breed ?
germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.08.2009 german newspapers facing readership crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are newspaper readers a dying breed ?
germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

she has pleaded for clemency from the clerical leadership as a second round of trials begins in the iranian capital . clotilde reiss , the french lecturer who was put on trial on saturday , told the court she participated in post-election protests in iran , but added that it was a " mistake , " official media has reported .
" my motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
but i accept that it was a mistake and i should not have gone to these gatherings , " reiss told a revolutionary court in tehran , according to the state irna news agency .
reiss , who was in the country to teach french , has been charged with acting against the country 's national security for being involved in unrest after the disputed june 12 presidential vote .
she allegedly took a photograph of one of the riots and emailed it to a friend in tehran .
she was arrested by iranian authorities while trying to board her plane back home on july 1 .
also on trial are two employees of the french and british governments .
nazak afshar , who works for the french embassy , told a tehran court on saturday that she and other staffers had been told to offer shelter to protesters if required , the official irna news agency said .
" in the event that confrontations occurred in front of the cultural department of the embassy , we were told to offer refuge to protesters if they asked , " afshar told the court .
the other defendant in the dock is british embassy local staffer hossein rassam , detained during riots along with eight embassy colleagues .
he has been charged with espionage .

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .

germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .

but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .

the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination .

the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .

she has pleaded for clemency from the clerical leadership as a second round of trials begins in the iranian capital . clotilde reiss , the french lecturer who was put on trial on saturday , told the court she participated in post-election protests in iran , but added that it was a " mistake , " official media has reported .
" my motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
but i accept that it was a mistake and i should not have gone to these gatherings , " reiss told a revolutionary court in tehran , according to the state irna news agency .
reiss , who was in the country to teach french , has been charged with acting against the country 's national security for being involved in unrest after the disputed june 12 presidential vote .
she allegedly took a photograph of one of the riots and emailed it to a friend in tehran .
she was arrested by iranian authorities while trying to board her plane back home on july 1 .
also on trial are two employees of the french and british governments .
nazak afshar , who works for the french embassy , told a tehran court on saturday that she and other staffers had been told to offer shelter to protesters if required , the official irna news agency said .
" in the event that confrontations occurred in front of the cultural department of the embassy , we were told to offer refuge to protesters if they asked , " afshar told the court .
the other defendant in the dock is british embassy local staffer hossein rassam , detained during riots along with eight embassy colleagues .
he has been charged with espionage .

defeated moderate candidates mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi accused authorities of election rigging , and tens of thousands of their supporters took to the streets in tehran and other major cities .
at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have since been released , though there are still around 250 in jail. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 08.08.2009 german defense minister rebuffs call for more troops in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has some 4,500 troops stationed in afghanistan german defense minister jung has spoken out against a call by the head of nato to deploy more troops in afghanistan as tension mounts over confirmation of the death of the taliban leader in neighboring pakistan . germany 's defense minister franz josef jung has rejected calls by the new nato secretary general andres fogh rasmussen for a greater german engagement in afghanistan .
in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 08.08.2009 marketing prison products helps inmates stay out of trouble großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : buttons produced " inside " for the " outside " a german prison has put inmates to work designing and marketing tongue-in-cheek fashion products .
the work gives them the self-confidence they need to stay out of trouble after they 're released . glasmoor , located just north of hamburg , is an " open prison " and looks more like a farm and is surrounded by forests and fields .
one of the buildings on the compound used to be a farm .
its door is usually wide open , welcoming visitors to the headquarters of " santa fu " - a brand of products that uses the prison both as their motto and their logo . " the people have to make the decision to stay here every day - without prison walls , each prisoner still must decide to stay put and not try to escape , " said prison director angela biermann .
the idea is that the lack of fences and barbed wire contributes to a positive atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the door to the workshop in glasmoor is always open inside the former barn , tables are scattered around the room and the walls are adorned with posters .
a cage is located on the left side , but it 's not a cell : it 's a storage space for santa fu products .
there 's an office to the right - walled in with windows , behind which a plump man with a moustache sits he sports a dark polo shirt with the word " judiciary , " printed in white lettering . the guard and the bad boys wolfgang muecke is the guard in the workshop .
the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .
the knaves , in this case , are six men in the shop , who are printing t-shirts and pin-on buttons with prison jargon . " since i 'm doing time myself , it would be a little weird wearing the brand , " said patrick , one of the workers .
" i do think it 's funny , though . " glasmoor is home to the warehouse and shipping department of the santa fu products .
the name of the brand actually stems from the " santu fu " nickname given to fuhlsbuettel prison , also located near hamburg . prisoners at both the glasmoor and fuhlsbuettel facilities work together with several advertising and marketing agencies to decide on which products to sell and which designs and sayings they should have on them . santa fu products have meanwhile become cult objects .
everything from t-shirts to games like " memory " to zippo lighters - the limited edition items are all printed with jargon relating to life in prison , all done in an authentic - yet tongue-in-cheek - style . " i gave some people the t-shirts with the words " life sentence / life imprisonment " printed on them as gifts - on the night before they got married , " said muecke with a proud look on his face .
" the little ' santa fu ' label printed on each t-shirt is now almost as popular as that little green crocodile of one of our competitor 's . " the only difference , he notes , is that competitors do not manufacture their products in prisons . bildunterschrift : wolfgang muecke is proud of the products gallows humor is a life-saver however successful the brand may be , one could still wonder whether all the poking fun - like the t-shirts with " life imprisonment " printed on them - could be insulting to the prisoners . " do n't forget that the products , and all the sayings on them , were developed by the prisoners themselves , " said prison director biermann .
" no one told them they have to print ' just released ' or ' life imprisonment ' on the shirts . " henrik works on one of the presses that print the jail jargon on pin-on buttons .
he thinks the humor found in the products is liberating : " there 's a bit of gallows humor involved .
it kind of helps us forget that we 're imprisoned . " the atmosphere is relaxed in the workshop , with the men often cracking jokes .
but , guard wolfgang muecke does n't want people to think that life in prison is a walk in the park . " imprisonment is always tough , " he said .
" it 's the worst thing imaginable - at least here in germany . " renewed confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : t-shirts are printed by hand while working in the shop does help make the time in prison easier , it also gives the prisoners a sense of purpose , especially since part of the products ' proceeds go to the " weisser ring , " an organization that helps victims of crime .
it also fosters a sense of confidence among the prisoners - that what they are producing is recognized and in demand " outside . " ultimately , it helps prepare inmates for a life outside the prison and for a future without crime . mehmed , who prints t-shirts in the workshop , can attest to how the recognition has boosted his confidence .

the 55-year-old has a cozy , jovial manner about him - as though he were really an actor playing the role of constable in a children 's film , in which he jokingly threatens the knaves with his fist .

but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .

inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "

however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .

according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 08.08.2009 bumper british bank profits reignite bonus debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bankers are looking forward to a return to happier times the uk economy is showing signs of recovery and banks are among the first to benefit from the improving conditions .
but , there is concern bankers are preparing to rake in enormous bonuses , once again . less than a year ago , some of britain 's biggest banks such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland faced collapse .
as they begged for taxpayers ' cash , bank chiefs lined up before a parliamentary committee and apologized profusely .
now , however , the situation looks somewhat different .
although unemployment continues to rise in the uk , there are signs that the worst downturn in decades could be coming to an end ; output from both manufacturing and services is up and the pound is performing well on currency markets .
the banks seem to be among the first to benefit from the improved financial conditions .
million euro salaries john purcell , one of london 's top head hunters , said the good times are just beginning to roll again – especially for the star traders and dealers , the so-called " rainmakers " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders on the stock exchange are reaping the rewards of the upturn " we 've just heard that one of these rainmakers has just gone from one bank to another for a basic salary of £ 40 million euros -lrb- 47 million euros , $ 67.6 million -rrb- , " purcell said .
" it 's huge bucks . "
the british bank group barclays pcl , which benefited indirectly from taxpayer support for the financial industry , but did not take a direct cash injection , is expected to pay out large bonuses after posting a bumper 2.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 3.16 billion -rrb- profit for the first six months of the year .
guaranteed bonuses bob diamond , head of barclays investment arm , barclay capital conceded that the bank has hired 200 staff on guaranteed bonuses since november last year and admitted to having contravened regulatory guidelines by awarding multi-year guaranteed bonuses to " less than a handful " .
" it is pay for performance and it is based on principles we have followed for a while now , " diamond said .
the bonus pool for british employees at the us bank goldman sachs is even bigger – 7 million euros .
but , the backlash has begun .
jack dromey , the deputy head of the unite labour union , said the evidence was “ absolutely clear ” that precisely these extravagant rewards fuelled the risky behaviour which caused the economic crisis in the first place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bonus culture has sparked protests in the past " there are some that have learned absolutely nothing from the debacle of the past , " dromey said .
" a debacle that has put at risk the jobs of hundreds of thousands that we represent .
inflated profits ?
even among enthusiasts for the free market system , some are worried .
according to former investment banker ros altman , people have to ask how “ meaningful ” these profits actually are .
" are they just exceptional items that we are managing to earn because the cost of funding is so low and the competition has gone away for a while , or is this some kind of real recovery , " altman asked .
as in the united states , british banks received unprecedented levels of support from the taxpayer – more than 1.4 trillion euros worth .
since the beginning of the financial crunch , the bank of england -lrb- the british central bank -rrb- has held short-term interest rates unnaturally low , allowing financial institutions to borrow cheaply and make a bigger profit on their loans .
all this makes the return of the bonus culture even more embarrassing for prime minister gordon brown , who denounced the lavish payouts in parliament barely six months ago , stating then that " the short-term bonus culture in banks has got to end . "
necessary evil ?
however , the bonuses are proving all but impossible to banish .
for one thing , says jillian tett of the financial times newspaper , the banks themselves have little choice because they are “ operating within a competitive environment . ”
" there is concern among the banks that if they do n't pay people well , they could lose some of the key people they need to keep their businesses , " tett said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banking sector is a vital component of britain 's economy with billions of euros worth of british taxpayer 's cash invested in some key british banks , the government has a keen interest in the financial institutions quickly rebuilding their businesses .
financial services are also a vital source of tax revenue for the uk government .
according to tett , this means a unilateral crackdown on bonuses is potentially out of the question .
" if the uk were to act alone in trying to clamp down on the bankers , if it did n't act within an international coordination , there is a real risk that the business could simply rush out of the uk , " tett said .
tett pointed out that one of the " tragedies " of the crisis is that at the very time governments need meaningful international coordination to change the way financial systems operate , " the severity of the crisis means there 's a growing tendency for each country to take measures without that kind of international coordination . "
nevertheless , political pressure is increasing .
as unemployment and home repossessions rise , so does resentment towards bankers ' bonuses .
a recent article in rolling stone magazine describing goldman sachs as " a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " has received a great deal of attention in the uk .

she has pleaded for clemency from the clerical leadership as a second round of trials begins in the iranian capital . clotilde reiss , the french lecturer who was put on trial on saturday , told the court she participated in post-election protests in iran , but added that it was a " mistake , " official media has reported .
" my motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
but i accept that it was a mistake and i should not have gone to these gatherings , " reiss told a revolutionary court in tehran , according to the state irna news agency .
reiss , who was in the country to teach french , has been charged with acting against the country 's national security for being involved in unrest after the disputed june 12 presidential vote .
she allegedly took a photograph of one of the riots and emailed it to a friend in tehran .
she was arrested by iranian authorities while trying to board her plane back home on july 1 .
also on trial are two employees of the french and british governments .
nazak afshar , who works for the french embassy , told a tehran court on saturday that she and other staffers had been told to offer shelter to protesters if required , the official irna news agency said .
" in the event that confrontations occurred in front of the cultural department of the embassy , we were told to offer refuge to protesters if they asked , " afshar told the court .
the other defendant in the dock is british embassy local staffer hossein rassam , detained during riots along with eight embassy colleagues .
he has been charged with espionage .
second round of trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiss is one of more than 100 activists on trial in tehran this is the second round of trials of iranian dissidents in tehran .
more than 100 activists , including several former officials , are charged with fomenting a revolution against the country 's islamic system , following the disputed june 12 presidential vote . the poll led to the re-election of hardline president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
defeated moderate candidates mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi accused authorities of election rigging , and tens of thousands of their supporters took to the streets in tehran and other major cities .
at least 20 protesters were killed and more than 1,000 were arrested in the biggest internal crisis to hit iran since the 1979 islamic revolution .
most of the people taken into custody have since been released , though there are still around 250 in jail. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she has pleaded for clemency from the clerical leadership as a second round of trials begins in the iranian capital . clotilde reiss , the french lecturer who was put on trial on saturday , told the court she participated in post-election protests in iran , but added that it was a " mistake , " official media has reported .
" my motive to take part in the gatherings was a personal one .
but i accept that it was a mistake and i should not have gone to these gatherings , " reiss told a revolutionary court in tehran , according to the state irna news agency .
reiss , who was in the country to teach french , has been charged with acting against the country 's national security for being involved in unrest after the disputed june 12 presidential vote .
she allegedly took a photograph of one of the riots and emailed it to a friend in tehran .
she was arrested by iranian authorities while trying to board her plane back home on july 1 .
also on trial are two employees of the french and british governments .
nazak afshar , who works for the french embassy , told a tehran court on saturday that she and other staffers had been told to offer shelter to protesters if required , the official irna news agency said .
" in the event that confrontations occurred in front of the cultural department of the embassy , we were told to offer refuge to protesters if they asked , " afshar told the court .
the other defendant in the dock is british embassy local staffer hossein rassam , detained during riots along with eight embassy colleagues .
he has been charged with espionage .

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .
" in this area we 've done a lot more than many of our european partners , " he said .
nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .
he justified the request by pointing out that the first success against insurgents in the south of the country only came after an increase in the number of troops .
pakistani taliban chief suspected dead meanwhile there is still uncertainty over the death of pakistani taliban leader baitullah mehsud , following a us drone strike in the northwest of the country .
government officials said they were awaiting full confirmation .
there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .
american officials and analysts said it may be too early to tell if the strike that apparently killed mehsud will prompt pakistan to sustain its active campaign against taliban and other militant leaders in the lawless region bordering afghanistan. mrm / ap / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with german newspaper bild am sonntag , jung said that there was no reason to commit more troops or money , adding that germany already has 4,500 soldiers deployed in the region with another 300 who are responsible for the upkeep of awacs planes .
the airborne warning and control systems crafts are versatile spy planes with advanced radar capabilities used to monitor military air traffic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung says more attention needs to be put on civilian reconstruction according to jung , the german government has invested 200 million euros -lrb- $ 286 million -rrb- each year in the region since 2002 , bringing the total so far to 1.2 billion euros .
the defense minister added that it is n't just about the military aspect anymore and that reconstruction of civilian infrastructure was just as important .

nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the call for more troops in afghanistan on friday .

there have been reports that the strike also killed mehsud 's wife and several guards in the tribal district of south waziristan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers across pakistan reported the death of baitullah mehsud despite his allegiance to afghan taliban leader mullah omar , mehsud was mainly focused on attacking government and civilian targets inside pakistan , sending only a few fighters from his militia - believed to be up to 20,000 strong - and several squads of suicide bombers to afghanistan .
that might have been the reason that dozens of strikes by cia operated pilotless aircraft spared him until recently , when washington realized that his terrorist acts could destabilize pakistan , a key ally in the fight against terrorism .
in march , the us state department announced a $ 5 million bounty on his head .

" we are encouraged that so may of our close friends and allies are also considering assisting us in our efforts to close the guantanamo bay detention facilities , " state department deputy spokesman robert wood said .
obama has pledged to close the prison by the end of january as he attempts to rebuild the us ’ image in the world .
the facility has been a source of sharp criticism of the united states , especially from the european union .

more than 200 detainees remain locked up at the camp on the naval installation in cuba .
wood said the united states and portugal were still working on the details to transfer custody .

germany 's newspapers are fighting for survival .
online news sources offer stiff competition and are free of charge , while the advertising market is shrinking .
especially younger readers are not buying a daily paper . for decades , newspapers were as much a part of a german breakfast as a cup of coffee or a bread roll , but now the internet boom – coupled with the economic bust – is threatening to make them a thing of the past .
young people , in particular , are shunning a visit to the newsstand and are logging on to computers instead .
according to a survey by the german paper sueddeutsche zeitung , only four percent of germans under the age of 20 still read a daily newspaper .
the sueddeutsche 's headline read simply : “ why a newspaper ? ”
crisis of content and circumstance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nowadays , a laptop would fit on the breakfast table , too it 's a question many consumers are asking themselves as well .
german newspapers have lost one fifth of their subscribers over the past decade .
to make matters worse , the current recession has led to a dramatic decline in the advertising sector , further threatening print media .
less advertising income means lower budgets , smaller papers and fewer reporters , leading inexorably to reduced content and a loss of quality .
completing this vicious circle is the drop in quality , meaning less news content for the same price .
the result drives even regular newspaper readers to seek better value for their money from other sources .
cutting costs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : writers for the axel springer publishing house are working shorter shifts nevertheless , major german publishers are being forced to react to their changing revenue streams .
late in july , such major players as gruner & jahr and axel springer introduced shorter shifts for many of their employees and , prior to that , the german editions of the lifestyle magazines “ vanity fair ” , “ amica ” , and “ tomorrow ” shut their doors for good .
germany 's biggest local paper , the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung made the biggest headlines earlier this year , though , laying off over 250 employees and closing two regional offices .
even insiders , like the editor-in-chief of financial times germany , stefan klusman , are prophesizing the death of the newspaper industry .
he said that the daily paper would be “ killed by the i-phone ” within the next five to 10 years .
embracing the internet bildunterschrift : newspapers need to attract readers of all ages however , there are editors that see some hope despite the rise of alternative media .
bernd ziesemer from the german business paper handelsblatt – which now has its own website – points out that most popular news websites rely on their newspaper , radio or television station editorial staffs to provide their content .
the answer , ziesemer believes , is to find a way to generate new revenue via the internet to make up for losses in the print medium .
but he also stresses that serious newspapers can not afford to lose their identities and must not cut costs so drastically that they can no longer maintain their reputation as original sources of exclusive content .
“ just sitting at a keyboard and throwing an article up on the internet by no means makes you a journalist , ” he says .
“ and , we -lsb- journalists -rsb- should be proud of that , if you ask me !
a really well-written article – regardless of whether it ends up online or in a newspaper – will always play an important role in our society . ”

properties are typically being undervalued by at least 10 % , said the national association of estate agents .
it said surveyors afraid of being sued by lenders were being overcautious .
but the royal institution of chartered surveyors denied the claim , saying the housing market was constantly changing and had lots of " imperfections " .
mortgage lenders , such as banks , routinely commission surveys to ensure the price agreed for a sale reflects the property 's current value .
' insurance fear ' if the valuation placed on the property by the lender is lower than the agreed price , the lender may choose to offer a smaller mortgage , leaving the buyer without enough money to cover the asking price and causing the deal to collapse .
lenders may also check the value of a property when it is being remortgaged to ensure they are not lending more than it is worth .
if a property is repossessed and the lender is forced to sell below its purchase price , it can sue the original valuer for negligence .

chief executive peter bolton king told the bbc : " they are perhaps worried about their professional indemnity insurance - they are thinking back to the 90s when surveyors were being sued by lenders for allegedly not getting the valuations right .
" they are perhaps worrying about the market and almost deliberatively knocking off 10 % almost regardless of what the property sold for .
" the other reason , which i found more worrying , is that we are hearing anecdotally that lenders are giving specific instructions to their valuers as to how they should approach these valuations . "
' duty bound ' sellers are also affected by undervaluing as they may have to drop prices and those seeking remortgages are left with little or no flexibility .
one homeowner , theresa timms , told the bbc she had had problems remortgaging her home in bridgend .
" the bank sent their own valuer who valued it at £ 80,000 , but i knew it was worth far more so i paid £ 300 to get it revalued , " she said .
" the valuer came and said it was worth £ 100,000 , but it was the same person that made the first valuation . "
there will be a range of valuations that the valuer will look at before they arrive at their opinion of value barry hall , royal institution of chartered surveyors andrew frankish , managing director of independent broker mortgage talk , said : " with the mortgages that are not completing , we believe up to half of them are affected by the valuation .
" what we mean by that is the valuation is coming back at lower than they predicted , which pushes them into a higher loan to value , which means the products are too expensive or the banks are reluctant to lend in that market at all .
" this is even worse in remortgages where around three-quarters of remortgages are affected . "
the council of mortgage lenders said it works with professionals who are duty bound to give accurate valuations .
those who value homes also deny any deliberate undervaluing .
barry hall , from the royal institution of chartered surveyors , said : " we are dealing with a market where there are lots of imperfections and there will be a range of valuations that the valuer will look at before they arrive at their opinion of value .
" that opinion of value could well be different from another opinion of value and could fluctuate over a period of time as well . "

properties are typically being undervalued by at least 10 % , said the national association of estate agents .
it said surveyors afraid of being sued by lenders were being overcautious .
but the royal institution of chartered surveyors denied the claim , saying the housing market was constantly changing and had lots of " imperfections " .
mortgage lenders , such as banks , routinely commission surveys to ensure the price agreed for a sale reflects the property 's current value .
' insurance fear ' if the valuation placed on the property by the lender is lower than the agreed price , the lender may choose to offer a smaller mortgage , leaving the buyer without enough money to cover the asking price and causing the deal to collapse .
lenders may also check the value of a property when it is being remortgaged to ensure they are not lending more than it is worth .

chief executive peter bolton king told the bbc : " they are perhaps worried about their professional indemnity insurance - they are thinking back to the 90s when surveyors were being sued by lenders for allegedly not getting the valuations right .
" they are perhaps worrying about the market and almost deliberatively knocking off 10 % almost regardless of what the property sold for .
" the other reason , which i found more worrying , is that we are hearing anecdotally that lenders are giving specific instructions to their valuers as to how they should approach these valuations . "
' duty bound ' sellers are also affected by undervaluing as they may have to drop prices and those seeking remortgages are left with little or no flexibility .
one homeowner , theresa timms , told the bbc she had had problems remortgaging her home in bridgend .
" the bank sent their own valuer who valued it at £ 80,000 , but i knew it was worth far more so i paid £ 300 to get it revalued , " she said .

" what we mean by that is the valuation is coming back at lower than they predicted , which pushes them into a higher loan to value , which means the products are too expensive or the banks are reluctant to lend in that market at all .
