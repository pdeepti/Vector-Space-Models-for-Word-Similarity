but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.02.2009 germany 's steinmeier talks tough on economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to capitalize on voters ' concerns about slowing growth and looming layoffs germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democrat candidate for the next chancellor , aims to turn financial regulation and restoring economic confidence into key campaign issues . in an interview with the london-based financial times this week , steinmeier said he would push for tough new regulations for investors , shareholders and managers if elected to germany 's top post in the fall .
" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
however , denying the holocaust is n't illegal in argentina , so authorities there claimed to have found some irregularities in williamson 's immigrations papers .
argentina is home to the largest jewish community in south america .
it was also considered a safe haven for many nazis fleeing germany after world war ii , including adolf eichmann , a key player in the conspiracy to exterminate the jews .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

25 , in a statement on his ministry 's web site that a " lion 's share of the contracts are going to german companies . "
guttenberg labeled the deals an " excellent message for germany 's export economy , " which has been hit hard by the global economic slump and is currently in a recession .
thirty-six contracts were sealed in total , with german automakers audi , bmw , daimler and vw securing chinese business , news agency afp reported .
the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .
ministers : no place for protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , left , and chen argued against protectionism at a meeting in berlin , chen and guttenberg said free trade and anti-protectionism were integral to helping germany and china through the global economic downturn .
" protectionism will not save the global economy , it will deepen the crisis , " chen said , speaking through an interpreter .
" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

he told his followers that chinese authorities were plotting a crackdown of " unimaginable " force .
" there is a heavy presence of armed security and military forces in most of the cities all over tibet , " the dalai lama said in his new year 's message .
" in all the places , those who dare to come out even with a slight hint of their aspirations have to face torture and detention . "
german government should speak up for tibet march 10 marks the 50th anniversary of tibet 's uprising in 1959 and the dalai lama 's subsequent exile to india .

" no one can say at the moment how our fellow countrymen in tibet are going to react to the pressure , " said tid 's head of the board , dalha agyitsang .

" this is a miracle . " the number of casualties was less than could have been expected because the plane hit soft , muddy ground and did not erupt in flames , yildirim added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 25.02.2009 german court upholds cashier 's dismissal for petty theft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cashiers need to be particularly trustworthy , the court said a german labor court has upheld the firing of a cashier who stole coupons worth 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.67 -rrb- .
but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .

" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 25.02.2009 google backs eu antitrust charges against microsoft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu charges could greatly damage internet explorer 's market share google has thrown its weight behind european commission antitrust charges against microsoft , insisting the software giant 's bundling of internet explorer web browser with windows is stifling competition and innovation . google vice president for product management , sundar pichai , lashed out at microsoft in a company blog on tuesday , feb .
24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .

although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .

-lrb- 09:31 gmt -rrb- . " the chance of survival in plane accidents is close to zero , " said turkish airlines and transportation minister binali yildirim , according to the anatolia news agency .
" this is a miracle . " the number of casualties was less than could have been expected because the plane hit soft , muddy ground and did not erupt in flames , yildirim added .

several incoming flights were directed to rotterdam airport . the plane from turkish airlines was built in 2002 and its last technical inspection was in december 2008 . the last major airplane crash in the netherlands was on october 4 , 1992 , when an el al cargo boeing 747f 4x-axg hit several high rise buildings south amsterdam 's bijlmer area , killing 43 people after two of its engines broke off during takeoff . author : mark mattox -lrb- ap / dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn / trinity hartman / sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .

schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.02.2009 hungary seeks a speedy switch to the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary sees euro zone accession as key to fighting financial crisis hungary 's prime minister has called on the eu to speed up procedures allowing new members to swap their national currencies for the euro .
a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 25.02.2009 opinion : obama shows confidence in face of gloomy times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his first important speech to congress , president barrack obama did n't sugarcoat the situation , but added he was confidant that the country would pull itself up again , say deutsche welle 's christina bergmann . barack obama did n't really have anything new to say in his speech , but that was n't necessary .
after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 25.02.2009 opinion : obama shows confidence in face of gloomy times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his first important speech to congress , president barrack obama did n't sugarcoat the situation , but added he was confidant that the country would pull itself up again , say deutsche welle 's christina bergmann . barack obama did n't really have anything new to say in his speech , but that was n't necessary .
after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
however , denying the holocaust is n't illegal in argentina , so authorities there claimed to have found some irregularities in williamson 's immigrations papers .
argentina is home to the largest jewish community in south america .
it was also considered a safe haven for many nazis fleeing germany after world war ii , including adolf eichmann , a key player in the conspiracy to exterminate the jews .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "

" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

germans are reportedly opting to stash extra cash in safes . german safe merchants said there had been a 30 percent increase in sales to private customers since october last year , news magazine der spiegel reported . while there are no concrete figures on exactly what is being locked away in attics around germany , the general feeling is that people are stockpiling cash .
" the customers have had diminished faith in the banks since about that time , it 's something we 're noticing again and again in conversations with customers , " said thies hartmann at safe merchant hamburger stahltresor .
yet using a safe for storing cash is by no means a risk-free method .
sure , there 's the possibility of a burglary .
and there 's also the need to remember that tricky combination .

a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

25 , in a statement on his ministry 's web site that a " lion 's share of the contracts are going to german companies . "
guttenberg labeled the deals an " excellent message for germany 's export economy , " which has been hit hard by the global economic slump and is currently in a recession .
thirty-six contracts were sealed in total , with german automakers audi , bmw , daimler and vw securing chinese business , news agency afp reported .
the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .
ministers : no place for protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , left , and chen argued against protectionism at a meeting in berlin , chen and guttenberg said free trade and anti-protectionism were integral to helping germany and china through the global economic downturn .
" protectionism will not save the global economy , it will deepen the crisis , " chen said , speaking through an interpreter .
" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .
eu-china summit back on the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china canceled the last summit in protest the signing of the trade deals comes as european union officials are seeking to revive a postponed eu-china summit originally scheduled for december last year .
the czech eu presidency has proposed a replacement meeting be held in may , but chinese officials have yet to respond to the suggestion , afp reported wednesday .
" during the -lrb- january -rrb- visit of premier wen jiabao to brussels ... they agreed the postponed summit would be held under the czech presidency in prague , most likely in may , " said a statement by the czech ambassador to china , vitezslav grepl .
the original summit was called off by china in protest over a meeting between exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and french president nicolas sarkozy .
france had held the rotating eu presidency at the time .
the eu-china meetings have been held yearly , with the exception of last year , since 1998 to discuss a range of bilateral , regional and global cooperation issues between the two countries .

germans are reportedly opting to stash extra cash in safes . german safe merchants said there had been a 30 percent increase in sales to private customers since october last year , news magazine der spiegel reported . while there are no concrete figures on exactly what is being locked away in attics around germany , the general feeling is that people are stockpiling cash .
" the customers have had diminished faith in the banks since about that time , it 's something we 're noticing again and again in conversations with customers , " said thies hartmann at safe merchant hamburger stahltresor .
yet using a safe for storing cash is by no means a risk-free method .
sure , there 's the possibility of a burglary .
and there 's also the need to remember that tricky combination .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .

" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "

" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .

the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .

the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.02.2009 bundesliga big boys bayern , bremen struggling after winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen went unrewarded in their clash with cottbus the new year has so far been unkind to german soccer giants bayern munich and werder bremen .
the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .

hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .

" there is a heavy presence of armed security and military forces in most of the cities all over tibet , " the dalai lama said in his new year 's message .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

25 , as their trade ministers oversaw the signing of a raft of business contracts worth more than $ 10 billion -lrb- 7.85 billion euros -rrb- . germany 's economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said wednesday , feb .
25 , in a statement on his ministry 's web site that a " lion 's share of the contracts are going to german companies . "
guttenberg labeled the deals an " excellent message for germany 's export economy , " which has been hit hard by the global economic slump and is currently in a recession .
thirty-six contracts were sealed in total , with german automakers audi , bmw , daimler and vw securing chinese business , news agency afp reported .
the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .
ministers : no place for protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , left , and chen argued against protectionism at a meeting in berlin , chen and guttenberg said free trade and anti-protectionism were integral to helping germany and china through the global economic downturn .
" protectionism will not save the global economy , it will deepen the crisis , " chen said , speaking through an interpreter .
" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .
eu-china summit back on the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china canceled the last summit in protest the signing of the trade deals comes as european union officials are seeking to revive a postponed eu-china summit originally scheduled for december last year .
the czech eu presidency has proposed a replacement meeting be held in may , but chinese officials have yet to respond to the suggestion , afp reported wednesday .
" during the -lrb- january -rrb- visit of premier wen jiabao to brussels ... they agreed the postponed summit would be held under the czech presidency in prague , most likely in may , " said a statement by the czech ambassador to china , vitezslav grepl .
the original summit was called off by china in protest over a meeting between exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and french president nicolas sarkozy .
france had held the rotating eu presidency at the time .
the eu-china meetings have been held yearly , with the exception of last year , since 1998 to discuss a range of bilateral , regional and global cooperation issues between the two countries .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
however , denying the holocaust is n't illegal in argentina , so authorities there claimed to have found some irregularities in williamson 's immigrations papers .
argentina is home to the largest jewish community in south america .
it was also considered a safe haven for many nazis fleeing germany after world war ii , including adolf eichmann , a key player in the conspiracy to exterminate the jews .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .

the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 25.02.2009 opinion : obama shows confidence in face of gloomy times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his first important speech to congress , president barrack obama did n't sugarcoat the situation , but added he was confidant that the country would pull itself up again , say deutsche welle 's christina bergmann . barack obama did n't really have anything new to say in his speech , but that was n't necessary .
after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .

juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .

" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .

bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .

although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

-lrb- 09:31 gmt -rrb- . " the chance of survival in plane accidents is close to zero , " said turkish airlines and transportation minister binali yildirim , according to the anatolia news agency .
" this is a miracle . " the number of casualties was less than could have been expected because the plane hit soft , muddy ground and did not erupt in flames , yildirim added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 25.02.2009 german court upholds cashier 's dismissal for petty theft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cashiers need to be particularly trustworthy , the court said a german labor court has upheld the firing of a cashier who stole coupons worth 1.30 euros -lrb- $ 1.67 -rrb- .
but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .
but we 've also been lucky , as our rivals are still only just ahead of us , " bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said after the clash .
" we 've lost two in a row , and we need to get out of this rut very quickly , starting with wednesday 's game in lisbon . "
' we lost our cool ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern gave away too much space in the box against cologne klinsmann brought in lukas podolski for the injured luca toni , but the germany striker - who is heading to cologne at the end of the season - could not impress and was replaced at half-time by us striker landon donovan .
" not much went right for us today .
we had the opening goal -lrb- from miroslav klose -rrb- disallowed , then we went behind and lost our cool , " klinsmann said .
" this is a really irritating defeat .
yet again , we 've missed a chance to go top of the table .
that 's very bitter .
put simply , it was a poor performance . "
schaaf : our own worst enemy bremen , meanwhile , would have hoped that their encouraging 1-1 midweek home draw with ac milan might improve their chances of earning bundesliga points over the weekend , but it was not to be at cottbus .
playmaker diego was well shackled and despite taking the lead through hugo almeida , bremen went down to goals from ivica iliev and dimitar rangelov .
bremen coach thomas schaaf said his side had only themselves to blame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus are fighting to avoid relegation from the bundesliga " again we have allowed our opponents too many chances and again we have put a lot of effort into a game and got too little out of it , " he said afterwards .
the defeat leaves bremen in 11th place with hopes of european football next season fading fast .
although still nine points off the relegation zone , a defeat at home to bayern would leave the team in trouble .
as it stands , the 21 rounds played so far this year represent bremen 's worst season since schaaf and sports director thomas allofs took the reins 10 years ago .
hoffenheim positive hertha meanwhile relinquished top spot after their defeat at wolfsburg .
the loss left them fuming after edin dzeko 's winner six minutes from time was allowed although the striker appeared to push josip simunic as he headed the ball over the line .
" it 's hard for us to take but referees are only human and make mistakes .
i only hope something like that does n't happen again , " hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre said .
the hoffenheim camp remains upbeat despite missing out on the full three points against stuttgart after sejad salihovic blasted over the bar from a stoppage-time penalty .
hoffenheim had taken the lead , but then were forced to twice come from behind in the 3-3 draw thanks to a hat-trick from senegal striker demba ba .

thirty-six contracts were sealed in total , with german automakers audi , bmw , daimler and vw securing chinese business , news agency afp reported .
the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .

" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .

the czech eu presidency has proposed a replacement meeting be held in may , but chinese officials have yet to respond to the suggestion , afp reported wednesday .
" during the -lrb- january -rrb- visit of premier wen jiabao to brussels ... they agreed the postponed summit would be held under the czech presidency in prague , most likely in may , " said a statement by the czech ambassador to china , vitezslav grepl .
the original summit was called off by china in protest over a meeting between exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and french president nicolas sarkozy .
france had held the rotating eu presidency at the time .
the eu-china meetings have been held yearly , with the exception of last year , since 1998 to discuss a range of bilateral , regional and global cooperation issues between the two countries .

the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .
ministers : no place for protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , left , and chen argued against protectionism at a meeting in berlin , chen and guttenberg said free trade and anti-protectionism were integral to helping germany and china through the global economic downturn .
" protectionism will not save the global economy , it will deepen the crisis , " chen said , speaking through an interpreter .
" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .
eu-china summit back on the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china canceled the last summit in protest the signing of the trade deals comes as european union officials are seeking to revive a postponed eu-china summit originally scheduled for december last year .
the czech eu presidency has proposed a replacement meeting be held in may , but chinese officials have yet to respond to the suggestion , afp reported wednesday .
" during the -lrb- january -rrb- visit of premier wen jiabao to brussels ... they agreed the postponed summit would be held under the czech presidency in prague , most likely in may , " said a statement by the czech ambassador to china , vitezslav grepl .
the original summit was called off by china in protest over a meeting between exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and french president nicolas sarkozy .
france had held the rotating eu presidency at the time .
the eu-china meetings have been held yearly , with the exception of last year , since 1998 to discuss a range of bilateral , regional and global cooperation issues between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 25.02.2009 opinion : obama shows confidence in face of gloomy times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his first important speech to congress , president barrack obama did n't sugarcoat the situation , but added he was confidant that the country would pull itself up again , say deutsche welle 's christina bergmann . barack obama did n't really have anything new to say in his speech , but that was n't necessary .
after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .
" we 're disappointed .
a win would have put us top of the table .

the bad luck is set to continue for one of the clubs when they meet each other in the upcoming round of bundesliga clashes . champions bayern slumped to a loss at home to cologne on saturday in what was their third defeat in four games since the bundesliga resumed after the winter break .
bremen meanwhile went down to a last-minute goal to lowly energie cottbus and have managed just one point from a possible 12 since the season resumed .
over a weekend of thrills and spills , all but one of bayern 's immediate rivals on the competition ladder faltered , unable to seize upon the defeat of juergen klinsmann 's men .
hertha berlin had led at wolfsburg but eventually lost 2-1 , while hoffenheim missed a stoppage-time penalty in an entertaining 3-3 draw against vfb stuttgart .
hamburg , however , rose to the top of the table after downing bayer leverkusen away from home , thanks to two unlikely goals from defender marcell jansen .
hoffenheim 's single point put them into second place on 40 points , ahead of hertha on goal difference , while bayern sit two points behind in fourth place and two points ahead of bayer .
important matchup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen klinsmann 's squad needs a win againt bremen to stay in the hunt while bayern still remain very much in the title race , bremen , champions in 2004 and for so long bayern 's chief rivals , are on the slide this season .
both clubs now face a crucial week ahead .
bayern play away against sporting lisbon in the champions league on wednesday , feb .
25 , and bremen visit ac milan in a battle for survival in the uefa cup on thursday .
but of more importance to their domestic standings , the two clubs meet in bremen on sunday for their next bundesliga encounter , and both will be desperate for a win .
bayern will still be licking their wounds after their surprise slip-up at home to cologne on sunday .
juergen klinsmann 's side were hit twice on the break in the first half through fabrice ehret and daniel brosinski , though managed to pull back a late consolation goal through daniel van buyten .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 25.02.2009 germany 's steinmeier talks tough on economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier hopes to capitalize on voters ' concerns about slowing growth and looming layoffs germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is the social democrat candidate for the next chancellor , aims to turn financial regulation and restoring economic confidence into key campaign issues . in an interview with the london-based financial times this week , steinmeier said he would push for tough new regulations for investors , shareholders and managers if elected to germany 's top post in the fall .
" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .

" the customers have had diminished faith in the banks since about that time , it 's something we 're noticing again and again in conversations with customers , " said thies hartmann at safe merchant hamburger stahltresor .
yet using a safe for storing cash is by no means a risk-free method .

" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .

" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

" to recover from this will require more than crisis management ...
it will take many years of work to restore people 's confidence in this economic system and its rules , " steinmeier told the newspaper in an interview published on monday , feb 23 .
his comments come as europe 's largest economy grapples with its worst recession in decades and struggles to prop up tottering banks and rescue ailing companies in an attempt to avoid large-scale layoffs .
steinmeier , currently the country 's foreign minister and vice chancellor , is leading the social democrats to challenge current chancellor angela merkel 's conservative bloc in national elections scheduled for september this year .
the interview with the london financial times is seen to be an attempt by steinmeier to raise his profile ahead of elections , according to the dpa news agency .
steinmeier facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turbo-capitalism is dead , " steinmeier said it 's been a difficult few years for steinmeier 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which has seen its popularity fall to historic lows .
the latest polls show that only 22 percent of germans would vote for the spd if elections were held today .
that 's far short of the majority steinmeier would need to become chancellor .
so far , the party has been unable to capitalize on voters ' worries about slowing economic growth and impending layoffs .
and the party has until now been unable to stop a surge in popularity for the opposition business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
steinmeier offered an indirect criticism of the fdp during the interview by criticizing the policies that led to the recent economic boom and bust .
" the turbo-capitalism of the past few years is dead , irrevocably so , " steinmeier told the financial times .
" we must now create a new order for the future , " he said .
making the case for intervention steinmeier stressed the need for aggressive government intervention when necessary to help the economy .
boosting consumption or offering tax cuts simply is n't enough when it comes to protecting germany 's industrial base during a global recession , he said .
steinmeier said he does not favor protectionism but he did say he believed the government should intervene to protect key german industries , instead of relying on stimulus measures , according to the ft .
he also hinted that bailouts could be acceptable in rare cases .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's government is using new incentives to drag the car industry out of its downturn in the interview , steinmeier proposed increasing the minimum amount of time investors must hold shares to avoid paying capital gains tax .
he also criticized fair-value accounting for encouraging risk-taking .
and he suggested the government set limits on the amount of debt private-equity investors should be allowed to use when taking over a business .
steinmeier also warned that germany 's business culture was changing .
" many shareholders became interested primarily in short-term success , " he said .
focus on reform merkel , steinmeier 's rival for the upcoming elections , has made it clear that she also wants economic reform .
this past weekend , merkel chaired a meeting of the european union 's biggest economies .
there , leaders drew up an action plan for overhauling the global financial system and combating the economic crisis .
the proposals will be presented in april to leaders of the group of 20 -lrb- g20 -rrb- leading industrial and emerging economies .
merkel used the meeting in berlin to signal that she is keen to play a leading role in drawing up a new regulatory framework for tackling the global financial crisis .
merkel has proposed cracking down on hedge funds and has endorsed a charter aimed at encouraging sustainable economic growth .

" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .

heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .

microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
however , denying the holocaust is n't illegal in argentina , so authorities there claimed to have found some irregularities in williamson 's immigrations papers .
argentina is home to the largest jewish community in south america .
it was also considered a safe haven for many nazis fleeing germany after world war ii , including adolf eichmann , a key player in the conspiracy to exterminate the jews .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "

the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .

but long-time supermarket employee 's supporters claim the woman was victimized for union activities . the theft was not a big one .
the cashier at a supermarket allegedly pocketed two coupons which had been lost by a customer .
the coupons were for a cash credit the store gave out for returning empty bottles .
but the stolen 1.30 euros was enough to get the 50-year-old supermarket employee fired .
the appeal judges in berlin ruled on tuesday , feb .
24 that it was within the rights of supermarket chain kaiser 's tengelmann to fire the cashier without notice .
the court said it was proven that barbara e. , whose full name was not made public , had taken and cashed in two empties vouchers .
the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .

25 , in a statement on his ministry 's web site that a " lion 's share of the contracts are going to german companies . "
guttenberg labeled the deals an " excellent message for germany 's export economy , " which has been hit hard by the global economic slump and is currently in a recession .
thirty-six contracts were sealed in total , with german automakers audi , bmw , daimler and vw securing chinese business , news agency afp reported .
the global auto industry is under particular pressure with worldwide sales having plunged since the financial crisis took hold late last year .
chinese trade minister chen deming is currently leading a delegation of more than 200 chinese companies on a tour of germany , spain , britain and switzerland to clench deals with auto , electronics and technology firms .
ministers : no place for protectionism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , left , and chen argued against protectionism at a meeting in berlin , chen and guttenberg said free trade and anti-protectionism were integral to helping germany and china through the global economic downturn .
" protectionism will not save the global economy , it will deepen the crisis , " chen said , speaking through an interpreter .
" we want to remain committed to opening up .
we will not engage in -lrb- protectionism -rrb- . "
chen said germany was " the most important economic partner " in europe .
guttenberg said that as the world 's two biggest export nations , germany and china have been significantly affected by the crisis .
" that 's why it 's particularly important for our two countries to strengthen bilateral trade relations , " he said .
he said the fresh deals between the two nations constituted " a powerful response to the global economy 's current crisis , which is a challenge for us both . "
guttenberg went on to urge china to take down trade barriers to enable german exporters greater access to the chinese market .
eu-china summit back on the cards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china canceled the last summit in protest the signing of the trade deals comes as european union officials are seeking to revive a postponed eu-china summit originally scheduled for december last year .
the czech eu presidency has proposed a replacement meeting be held in may , but chinese officials have yet to respond to the suggestion , afp reported wednesday .
" during the -lrb- january -rrb- visit of premier wen jiabao to brussels ... they agreed the postponed summit would be held under the czech presidency in prague , most likely in may , " said a statement by the czech ambassador to china , vitezslav grepl .
the original summit was called off by china in protest over a meeting between exiled tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama and french president nicolas sarkozy .
france had held the rotating eu presidency at the time .
the eu-china meetings have been held yearly , with the exception of last year , since 1998 to discuss a range of bilateral , regional and global cooperation issues between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.02.2009 hungary seeks a speedy switch to the euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary sees euro zone accession as key to fighting financial crisis hungary 's prime minister has called on the eu to speed up procedures allowing new members to swap their national currencies for the euro .
a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .

it 's the company 's first overall loss since privatization of the german postal industry in 1995 . the high losses at the world 's biggest logistics company were largely a result of the company 's loss-making us business arm dhl express mail , as well as deficits at the company 's postbank subsidiary , according to an announcement made on wednesday , feb .
25 . the board of management has turned down any bonus payments for 2008 , deutsche post spokeswoman silje skogstad said . unlike managers , deutsche post shareholders will receive a reduced dividend of 0.6 euros per share for 2008 , compared to a 0.9-euro dividend the year before . much bad news bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl express has cost the post a lot of money in the fourth quarter of 2008 , earnings before tax and interest , cleared of one-off charges , stood at 765 million euros .
for the same period in 2007 , this figure stood at 1.04 billion euros . bottom-line earnings fell from 253 million euros in the previous year , to minus 3.16 billion euros in 2008 .
turnover from october to the end of december shrank from 14.5 billion euros in 2007 to 14.02 billion euros last year . tough year ahead given the disappointing results for 2008 and the difficult economic environment at present , the board of deutsche post is presently not giving estimates for 2009 .

a downturn in eastern europe could hurt lenders in richer western nations . hungarian prime minister ferenc gyurcsany said a quicker entry into the euro zone would help eastern europe counteract the current economic crisis . " the best protection against foreign exchange problems is to join the euro zone , " gyurcsany told journalists in brussels on tuesday , feb .
24 .
" we should see how the steps towards the euro could be made quicker . "
in particular , countries which have met the eu 's strict rules on inflation and budget discipline should be allowed to join the single currency without having to spend two years in the preparatory " exchange rate mechanism 2 , " gyurcsany said after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso .
" without relaxing the conditions of euro accession , do we have to wait two years in the anteroom ? "
gyurcsany said .
" is it important to keep these countries in the lobby for so long ? "
barroso said while the eu 's executive was keen to see all eu newcomers join the euro , those countries would have to meet the criteria for joining the currency , and would have to win the approval of current members for any fast-track accession .
crisis hitting eastern europe hard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gyurcsany wants hungary to quickly switch to the euro according to ratings agency standard & poor 's , rapid growth in eastern europe is " shuddering to a halt . "
" all the ingredients for a crisis are in place , " it said in a report .
this was due to rising government debt and a heavy reliance on foreign lending , often foreign currency loans for real estate purchases .
in order to join the euro zone , members have to keep their inflation below agreed levels and maintain their government budget deficits at below three percent of gross domestic product .
according to the commission , hungary 's 2009 deficit should fall below this mark for the first time in over a decade .
currently , 16 of the 27 member states have the common currency euro .
" the euro has been a very important factor of stability - a shield of protection , " barroso said .
eu support for hungary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso says hungary has responded appropriately to the crisis eastern european currencies have fallen strongly against the euro in recent months .
in october , the commission agreed to give hungary 6.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- as part of an international rescue plan with the international monetary fund and the world bank .
it is aimed at reinforcing the hungarian currency forint .
barroso said hungary 's crisis response plan showed the " right policies . "
" our assessment is positive and the next installment will be paid at the end of march , " barroso said , without giving an amount .
the hungarian government had agreed to tight budgetary policies in exchange for the massive lifeline to help it avert default .
however , the economy was still experiencing major problems , gyurcsany said .
" we 're in serious trouble indeed , " the hungarian prime minister said .

" we desperately hope that this year , demonstrators wo n't again be brutally beaten down and tibetans persecuted in masses . "

after just five weeks in office , his administration has accomplished amazing things : they 've passed an almost $ 800 billion -lrb- 628 billion euro -rrb- stimulus package , got the ball rolling on help for families forced to sell their homes and for banks that have gone into a tailspin , sent special envoys to the world 's trouble spots and ordered the closing of guantanamo .
no one should seriously expect these measures to have an immediate effect .
the usa is like a supertanker : the new captain on board can order a new course , but such a large ship will still take a while to change direction .
so the president has done what is , at the moment , the most important thing he can do – conveyed an image of confidence to his fellow countrymen .
in america the economic crisis is also a crisis of trust .
the stock market does n't trust the government , banks do n't trust consumers , and consumers have no trust in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann however the americans still trust their president .
obama 's approval rating has barely budged since he took office .
obama is very thankful to the people of the us , who he is certain will maintain the new course .
he radiates calm and assurance ; because what the us needs the least is a president willing to throw his principles overboard .
while the dourness and resistance to criticism that marked the bush administration has n't continued , it 's still too early to label barack obama as perfect .
many things that the new government has undertaken have had their problems .
the stock market is still waiting for the second half of the program to support the financial sector .
the third nominee for secretary of commerce has been put forth , after the first two that obama had found pulled out .
and evidence of bi-partisan cooperation is hard to find .
but this is small change compared to the mammoth task facing barack obama and his administration .
those who have accused the young president of failing need to ask themselves whether or not his republican rival for the presidency , john mccain , really would have been a better alternative in this situation .

bishop richard williamson , former head of a seminary of the society of saint pius x , caused international outrage when he said in an interview with swedish televisions that no more than 300,000 jews died at the hands of the nazis during world war ii and specifically claimed that no gas chambers were used .
he was among four ultra-traditionalist members of the bishops whose 1988 excommunication pope benedict xvi revoked last month , a decision that unleashed waves of furor through both the jewish and catholic communities worldwide .
argentine outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until recently , williamson was head of the seminary of the society of st. pius x in la reja , argentina the argentine government had given williamson 10 days to leave argentina before he was forcibly removed because his remarks on the holocaust as " deeply offensive to argentine society , the jewish people and humanity . "
however , denying the holocaust is n't illegal in argentina , so authorities there claimed to have found some irregularities in williamson 's immigrations papers .
argentina is home to the largest jewish community in south america .
it was also considered a safe haven for many nazis fleeing germany after world war ii , including adolf eichmann , a key player in the conspiracy to exterminate the jews .

the kaiser 's attorney karin schindler-abbes said the dispute was not about the money .
" it 's about trust , " schindler-abbes told german television ard .
" a cashier has to be absolutely trustworthy and 100 percent honest .
if a cashier puts the trust of his employer at risk through his conduct , he has to reckon with losing his job . "
in its ruling , the court said an " irreparable loss of confidence " had resulted through the cashier 's behavior .
this was a decisive factor in the dismissal , despite the over 30 years e. spent behind the cash register at the store .
the amount did not play a role .
" the loss of confidence was in this case even more strong as the claimant consistently made false statements during the employer 's questioning , which she then simply dropped when they were refuted by the employer , " the court said in a statement .
" she , for example , incriminated a colleague who had nothing to do with the matter without reason or justification . "
hundreds of similar cases the case has seen various solidarity campaigns for e. , nicknamed " emmely . "
her supporters , including labor groups , said she was victimized for union activities .
in 2007 , e. led strikes against the supermarket 's new owners for higher pay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara e. fought back tears following the ruling but the court said in its ruling that it could not determine a connection between the cashier 's participation in strikes and her dismissal .
it said there was no evidence of victimization .
supporters have organized " solidarity with emmely " demonstrations , along with an emmely web site .
they have mounted protests all over germany , putting emmely stickers on fruit in the chain 's other stores .
numerous supporters were at the ruling on tuesday , leading to a heated atmosphere in the courtroom .
one of the " solidarity with emmely " members told reporters that the interest was so large because this was " a typical case . "
" we know from conversations with works councils that there are hundreds of similar cases , " he said .
the ruling sparked roars of laughter in the courtroom , with some spectators calling " class justice . "
" this is carte blanche for every employer to throw out people who speak their minds , " said one viewer .
e. 's attorney benno hopmann said the verdict was " a scandal . "
" this ruling is a ruling from the employer 's point of view , " hopmann said .
" my client 's perspective completely fell by the wayside . "
the big fish get away the confederation of german trade unions dgb said that while normal employees had to bear the brunt of the law , top managers safeguarded themselves in their contracts against becoming liable for mismanagement or bankruptcy .
the left-wing faction in berlin 's city parliament said the case was incomprehensible and left " a bitter aftertaste . "
" it 's infuriating that in times of economic and financial crises , a shortage of 1.30 euros leads to losing a job , while in contrast , billions of losses in companies are sweetened with bonuses for managers , " said faction leader carola bluhm .
following tuesday 's ruling , hopmann said he will submit a complaint of unconstitutionality , even going as far as the european court of human rights , if necessary .
e. can not appeal the ruling .
e. , the mother of two children , now draws hartz iv social benefits .
she had begun work at the shop in 1977 , when it was an east german food store , and saw it transformed into a western-style supermarket after communism ended .
" i did n't do what i 've been accused of , " e. said in tears after the ruling .

24 , saying the tying of internet explorer -lrb- ie -rrb- to windows gave the program an unfair advantage over other browsers .
he said google would apply to become a third party in the commission 's antitrust proceeding against microsoft .
the search engine leader joins mozilla - producer of the firefox web browser - and private norwegian firm opera in arguing against microsoft 's practices .
" google 's perspective will be useful as the european commission evaluates remedies to improve the user experience and offer consumers real choices , " pichai said in his blog .
" we do n't know how the commission 's proceeding will evolve , " he said .
" but we are confident that more competition in this space will mean greater innovation on the web and a better user experience for people everywhere .
" greater competition will drive more innovation within browsers themselves - as well as in web design , enabling sites to load faster and offer new kinds of interactive tools and applications . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other browsers such as firefox are overwhelmed by internet explorer microsoft market leader google unveiled its own browser , chrome , late last year , but the application has yet to attract significant market share .
as of january , microsoft 's ie has a hold on 67.5 percent of web users , while firefox is next with 21.53 percent , followed by apple 's safari with 8.29 percent and chrome with 1.12 percent , according to figures from internet research firm net applications , news agency afp reported .
" google believes that the browser market is still largely uncompetitive , which holds back innovation for users , " pichai said .
in january , european regulators formally charged microsoft with abusing its overwhelming market position by bundling its ie web browser with its windows operating systems , which are used in 95 percent of the world 's pcs .
heavy fines a possibility if microsoft loses the case , it could be made to pay considerable fines in addition to untying ie from windows , and possibly even allow customers to disable ie , a commission spokesman said in brussels on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google chrome has barely been able to break into the market the commission would consider ordering microsoft to give users an objective opportunity to choose between competing web browsers instead of , or in addition to , internet explorer , the spokesman said .
" microsoft could also be ordered to technically allow the user to disable internet explorer code should the user choose to install a competing browser , " the spokesman added .
microsoft has until march to respond to the commission 's charges .
the company has already been fined more than $ 2 billion -lrb- 1.56 billion euros -rrb- for past violations and for failing to act on commission rulings .

some 125 labour mps oppose the scheme , fearing full privatisation and job cuts and citing labour 's election pledge to keep the service public .
lord mandelson said he was " absolutely clear " it would stay publicly owned .
but he told the bbc that new investment was sorely needed as royal mail " was in danger of running out of money " .
while he said he was sorry for the " political pain " that the proposals were causing in labour ranks , he vowed not to " walk away " from the plans .
political fight the government says the royal mail needs new investment in technology to survive .
ministers insist the plan , due to be introduced in the house of lords on thursday , is not a sell-off but a " partnership " which maintains labour 's manifesto commitment to keep the royal mail in public ownership .
a total of 145 mps have signed a commons motion opposing the move .
the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said there was disagreement on tuesday over how the bill should be presented to parliament at a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee , responsible for legislation , chaired by harriet harman .
although ministers deny any differences over the substance of the bill , nick robinson said there was anxiety about the prospect of a political fight the government may struggle to win .
lord mandelson said the taxpayer could not be expected to fund potential liabilities in the region of £ 8bn without seeing an improvement in the performance of the company .
the government has proposed taking over responsibility for the pension scheme as part of the proposed sell-off package .
in a letter to lord mandelson , jane newell - the chair of trustees of royal mail 's pension scheme - warned its deficit could rise well in excess of its current £ 5.9bn , should a stake not be sold .
but the communication workers ' union said the publication of the letter was an effort to " scare " mps into voting with the government . "

when the pension deficit was revalued , it was expected to reach between £ 8bn and £ 9bn , he said .
he added : " the simple fact is the business does n't generate enough cash to fund the investment required to modernise the business and ensure the future of the uso -lrb- universal service obligation -rrb- . "

the government has proposed taking over responsibility for the pension scheme as part of the proposed sell-off package .
in a letter to lord mandelson , jane newell - the chair of trustees of royal mail 's pension scheme - warned its deficit could rise well in excess of its current £ 5.9bn , should a stake not be sold .

he added : " the simple fact is the business does n't generate enough cash to fund the investment required to modernise the business and ensure the future of the uso -lrb- universal service obligation -rrb- . "

they are worried about possible job losses and the impact of the private sector involvement on the universal service .

stressing the severity of the economic crisis , mr obama told lawmakers the us would emerge stronger when it ended .
" we will rebuild , we will recover , " mr obama said , adding : " now is the time to act boldly and wisely . "
republicans said mr obama 's plans were " wasteful " , saying they spent " money we do not have on things we do not need " .
mr obama has seen congress pass a $ 787bn -lrb- £ 545bn -rrb- economic stimulus plan and is preparing to announce a budget .

obama : ' we will recover ' the package , signed after compromises debated in both houses , was designed to channel federal money toward infrastructure projects , health care , renewable energy development and conservation programmes .
the first month of mr obama 's presidency has also included a banking bail-out worth at least $ 1.5 trillion -lrb- £ 1.02 trillion -rrb- and a plan to support " responsible homeowners " struggling with mortgages .
he won a standing ovation when he told his audience that banks and bankers taking public money would be fully accountable , vowing that tax dollars would not be frittered away .
" those days are over , " mr obama said .
" it 's not about helping banks , it 's about helping people . "
see whole word cloud of barack obama 's speech to congress the speech came days before the unveiling of the administration 's first budget , with sights set on reducing the giant us deficit , currently standing at about $ 1 trillion .
mr obama said the vast deficit and the " crushing cost " of healthcare made the need for wide-ranging reform more urgent than ever , and he pledged to reform and improve the nation 's schooling and boost the numbers of students in higher education .
he restated a pledge made on monday to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term , and said officials had begun to go " line by line " through the federal budget " to eliminate wasteful and ineffective " schemes .
foreign fields the bbc 's kevin connolly in washington says barack obama delivered a powerful address , offering more hope than in recent major speeches .
the address looks and feels like the state of the union speech which normally come at about this point in the political calendar .
but because mr obama is new to office , and therefore not in a position to take responsibility for the triumphs and disasters of 2008 , this was billed simply as an address to the joint houses , our correspondent adds .
while much of his speech focused on domestic issues , mr obama also touched on the key foreign policy issues facing his administration .
reviews of us involvement in both iraq and afghanistan were currently ongoing , the president said , and would soon deliver their results .
the terrorists - in obamaland - are lumped in with other problems the world faces : global warming , disease , etc justin webb bbc north america editor read justin webb 's blog will obama feed hunger for hope ?
he promised a " new and comprehensive strategy " for afghanistan and pakistan aimed at defeating al-qaeda and defeating extremism .
and while he paid tribute to us troops serving overseas , there was no detailed reference to plans for iraq , or any reference to iran , whose nuclear programme is viewed by many analysts as a major foreign policy challenge for the new president .
the speech came as some of the first polls analysing mr obama 's level of public support indicated that voters still strongly back the man they chose for office fewer than four months ago .
a new york times / cbs news poll published ahead of his speech put the president 's approval rating at 63 % , with a washington post / abc news survey showing 68 % support .
the presidential address - which began late and lasted a little over 45 minutes - was followed by a response from republican bobby jindal .
the 37-year-old governor of louisiana - the first indian-american to occupy such a post - is one of the republican party 's rising stars , and is tipped as a likely contender for the white house four years from now .
he was highly critical of mr obama 's plans , dismissing the stimulus plan and banking bail-out as washington waste .
" the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of washington politicians , " he said .
reaction to president obama 's speech the economic crisis requires immediate , bold and comprehensive action .
and on tuesday night , mr obama displayed the ambition and the sweeping vision that won him the white house - and that this crisis demands .
it was a refreshing change after his less-than-forceful handling of the stimulus bill .
editorial , new york times the speech capped an often frantic start for his administration that has surpassed even the first month of fdr 's new deal .
and for obama , it was a chance to step back and spell out the full scope of the challenges facing the nation — and connect the dots of his economic plan for moving ahead .
david rogers , politico well , this was an extraordinary speech .
we certainly do have a new president .
my own reaction was that obama looked stronger and more confident tonight than i have ever seen him before - and he has never lacked for confidence in the past .
robert g kaiser , washington post well , the problem for republicans is that , -lrb- a -rrb- , americans support obama 's tax plan as laid out during the campaign . -lrb- b -rrb- , americans are demanding more government involvement .

obama : ' we will recover ' the package , signed after compromises debated in both houses , was designed to channel federal money toward infrastructure projects , health care , renewable energy development and conservation programmes .
the first month of mr obama 's presidency has also included a banking bail-out worth at least $ 1.5 trillion -lrb- £ 1.02 trillion -rrb- and a plan to support " responsible homeowners " struggling with mortgages .
he won a standing ovation when he told his audience that banks and bankers taking public money would be fully accountable , vowing that tax dollars would not be frittered away .
" those days are over , " mr obama said .
" it 's not about helping banks , it 's about helping people . "
see whole word cloud of barack obama 's speech to congress the speech came days before the unveiling of the administration 's first budget , with sights set on reducing the giant us deficit , currently standing at about $ 1 trillion .
mr obama said the vast deficit and the " crushing cost " of healthcare made the need for wide-ranging reform more urgent than ever , and he pledged to reform and improve the nation 's schooling and boost the numbers of students in higher education .
he restated a pledge made on monday to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term , and said officials had begun to go " line by line " through the federal budget " to eliminate wasteful and ineffective " schemes .
foreign fields the bbc 's kevin connolly in washington says barack obama delivered a powerful address , offering more hope than in recent major speeches .
the address looks and feels like the state of the union speech which normally come at about this point in the political calendar .
but because mr obama is new to office , and therefore not in a position to take responsibility for the triumphs and disasters of 2008 , this was billed simply as an address to the joint houses , our correspondent adds .
while much of his speech focused on domestic issues , mr obama also touched on the key foreign policy issues facing his administration .
reviews of us involvement in both iraq and afghanistan were currently ongoing , the president said , and would soon deliver their results .
the terrorists - in obamaland - are lumped in with other problems the world faces : global warming , disease , etc justin webb bbc north america editor read justin webb 's blog will obama feed hunger for hope ?
he promised a " new and comprehensive strategy " for afghanistan and pakistan aimed at defeating al-qaeda and defeating extremism .
and while he paid tribute to us troops serving overseas , there was no detailed reference to plans for iraq , or any reference to iran , whose nuclear programme is viewed by many analysts as a major foreign policy challenge for the new president .
the speech came as some of the first polls analysing mr obama 's level of public support indicated that voters still strongly back the man they chose for office fewer than four months ago .
a new york times / cbs news poll published ahead of his speech put the president 's approval rating at 63 % , with a washington post / abc news survey showing 68 % support .
the presidential address - which began late and lasted a little over 45 minutes - was followed by a response from republican bobby jindal .
the 37-year-old governor of louisiana - the first indian-american to occupy such a post - is one of the republican party 's rising stars , and is tipped as a likely contender for the white house four years from now .
he was highly critical of mr obama 's plans , dismissing the stimulus plan and banking bail-out as washington waste .
" the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of washington politicians , " he said .
reaction to president obama 's speech the economic crisis requires immediate , bold and comprehensive action .
and on tuesday night , mr obama displayed the ambition and the sweeping vision that won him the white house - and that this crisis demands .
it was a refreshing change after his less-than-forceful handling of the stimulus bill .
editorial , new york times the speech capped an often frantic start for his administration that has surpassed even the first month of fdr 's new deal .
and for obama , it was a chance to step back and spell out the full scope of the challenges facing the nation — and connect the dots of his economic plan for moving ahead .
david rogers , politico well , this was an extraordinary speech .
we certainly do have a new president .
my own reaction was that obama looked stronger and more confident tonight than i have ever seen him before - and he has never lacked for confidence in the past .
robert g kaiser , washington post well , the problem for republicans is that , -lrb- a -rrb- , americans support obama 's tax plan as laid out during the campaign . -lrb- b -rrb- , americans are demanding more government involvement .

the address looks and feels like the state of the union speech which normally come at about this point in the political calendar .
but because mr obama is new to office , and therefore not in a position to take responsibility for the triumphs and disasters of 2008 , this was billed simply as an address to the joint houses , our correspondent adds .
while much of his speech focused on domestic issues , mr obama also touched on the key foreign policy issues facing his administration .
reviews of us involvement in both iraq and afghanistan were currently ongoing , the president said , and would soon deliver their results . "
the terrorists - in obamaland - are lumped in with other problems the world faces : global warming , disease , etc " justin webb bbc north america editor read justin webb 's blog will obama feed hunger for hope ?
he promised a " new and comprehensive strategy " for afghanistan and pakistan aimed at defeating al-qaeda and defeating extremism .
and while he paid tribute to us troops serving overseas , there was no detailed reference to plans for iraq , or any reference to iran , whose nuclear programme is viewed by many analysts as a major foreign policy challenge for the new president .
the speech came as some of the first polls analysing mr obama 's level of public support indicated that voters still strongly back the man they chose for office fewer than four months ago .
a new york times / cbs news poll published ahead of his speech put the president 's approval rating at 63 % , with a washington post / abc news survey showing 68 % support .
the presidential address - which began late and lasted a little over 45 minutes - was followed by a response from republican bobby jindal .
the 37-year-old governor of louisiana - the first indian-american to occupy such a post - is one of the republican party 's rising stars , and is tipped as a likely contender for the white house four years from now .
he was highly critical of mr obama 's plans , dismissing the stimulus plan and banking bail-out as washington waste .
" the way to lead is not to raise taxes and put more money and power in hands of washington politicians , " he said .
reaction to president obama 's speech " the economic crisis requires immediate , bold and comprehensive action .
and on tuesday night , mr obama displayed the ambition and the sweeping vision that won him the white house - and that this crisis demands .
it was a refreshing change after his less-than-forceful handling of the stimulus bill . "
editorial , new york times " the speech capped an often frantic start for his administration that has surpassed even the first month of fdr 's new deal .
and for obama , it was a chance to step back and spell out the full scope of the challenges facing the nation — and connect the dots of his economic plan for moving ahead . "
david rogers , politico " well , this was an extraordinary speech .
we certainly do have a new president .
my own reaction was that obama looked stronger and more confident tonight than i have ever seen him before - and he has never lacked for confidence in the past . "
robert g kaiser , washington post " well , the problem for republicans is that , -lrb- a -rrb- , americans support obama 's tax plan as laid out during the campaign . -lrb- b -rrb- , americans are demanding more government involvement .
remember october 2008 : the specter of socialism , as dredged up by the gop , failed .
and the problems were n't as bad as they are now ! "

the president 's speech lasted nearly an hour and came days before his first budget as us leader .
the speech brought the audience to its feet more than 30 times , but with its references to the $ 787bn economic stimulus bill the republicans opposed , it was not universally well-received .
it took more than five minutes for the president to reach the dais because of the crowd of well-wishers - and the crush was a similar size on the way out as members of the audience tried to get a handshake or a photo .
the speech made reference both to the healthcare and education reforms mr obama plans , and also the desire not to fritter away tax dollars .
the address looked and felt like the state of the union speech , which normally comes at about this point in the political calendar .
as america comes to terms with the depth of the economic recession , president obama 's speech struck an optimistic tone - america would bounce back .

the prince of wales scholarship programme will recruit 100 top graduates between 2009 and 2012 .

the university of wales , which is running the scheme , said it would allow the university and wales to compete on a global stage .

" this is about recruiting extraordinary people to make sure wales is at the frontier of research and industrial excellence and we anticipate that we will have the best graduates globally competing to get on the scheme . "

the graduates will receive funding which organisers say is one of the best phd packages in the world - £ 20,000 each year , plus tuition fees and a £ 5,000 research grant .
they will work with businesses to help create new products , processes , patents and services , and improve research and development .
the prince of wales , who is chancellor of the university of wales , said it was a " new and exciting " scheme that would make a " significant impact " on innovation in wales .

deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones , who is also minister for the economy , said the scholarships would enhance wales ' " contribution to economic prosperity as the world emerges from recession " .
" in this increasingly competitive global environment , science is vital for a successful 21st century economy , " he said .
" we need to ensure business has ready access to the latest developments in science and technology , and these scholarships will help ensure we incorporate innovation into the goods and services we produce and export around the world . "
the scheme will be run by the university of wales global academy and is partly funded by the european regional development fund .
it is expected that the scholarships will continue beyond 2012 , subject to funding .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- wales politics -pipe- ' yes ' , but not yet , says plaid am bbc news / wales politics graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- magazine 07:25 gmt , wednesday , 25 february 2009 ' yes ' , but not yet , says plaid am bethan jenkins has been a plaid cymru am since 2007 ' true wales ' against more powers the all wales convention is running a series of public events to consider arguments for and against further assembly powers .
we asked two figures on either side of the devolution fence the same key questions to highlight the major issues as they see them .
here plaid cymru am bethan jenkins insists there is no evidence a referendum on full law-making powers would be lost but says it is not time for a " yes " campaign just yet .
why is your campaign so important to you ?
i think it is firstly important to emphasise that a " yes " campaign has not yet been established , that is something that could only happen formally , once the all wales convention has concluded .
the cross-party group i 've been working on is about bringing people together to discuss how a yes campaign best articulates the reasons we need a ' yes ' vote .
what makes you believe many people will take notice of your efforts ?
i believe that people in wales are growing more frustrated at the laborious constitutional process we have to implement to pass the most basic of policies for the good of our communities , and that we are the only country in the uk with such a process .
if a referendum was carried out now what do you think the result would be and why ?
i am heartened by the few opinion polls that have been conducted which show a majority in favour of increased powers and i think that reflects the growing confidence of our people in wanting decisions made closer to home .
but despite this clear trend , i want all of us who believe in the need for change to work hard for it .
i see it as my job to ensure that we make improvements for the people of wales .
how democratic is it to hold a referendum only at a time when one side believes it can win ?
that in itself is democratic because if there was absolutely no desire for further powers then we could n't be considering a referendum on that issue .
the people of wales are sovereign and it is they who should always have the final say on constitutional change .
would you be willing to support a referendum even if the evidence indicates you are likely to lose , in order to allow people 's voice to be heard ?
there is no evidence to suggest that a referendum would be lost and the all wales convention is currently in our communities , gauging public opinion .
it would be wrong to pre-empt the work of the convention .
if your arguments were to win a referendum would this settle the matter for a generation or more , or would you want further significant changes sooner ?
my party has been consistent on the general principle that the people of wales are sovereign .
they decide on constitutional questions and they decide the pace of constitutional change .
no politician has the right to say " this far and no further " to the people of any nation .
what is the best example of success or failure under the current system to back your argument ?
nearly two years ago , a process started to get powers from westminster which would enable wag -lrb- the welsh assembly government -rrb- to suspend the right to buy council or housing association properties where there are not enough to go round .
today , we 're still no nearer legislating to implement our policy to tackle this serious issue .
such a system is surely unsustainable ?
what future do you foresee for the 40 welsh mps ?
for as long as important decisions are made in westminster that have an effect on the people of wales , we need to ensure our communities have strong representation there .
but of course , i hope that more decisions affecting our communities will be made closer to those communities .
what question do you think people should be asked in the vote ?
" do you believe the national assembly for wales should have primary law-making powers on devolved matters ? "
should people have a chance to vote to abolish the assembly , in order to reflect views fully , and why ?
i personally have always favoured multi-choice referenda , and would have preferred us to have had several options in the original referendum in 1997 .
but i think it is a positive thing that people have a clear choice ahead of them at this referendum , and its pointless re-visiting decisions that the people have already made .
should people also be able to vote for independence and why ?
this is not a vote on independence and the scope of this referendum is limited by the 2006 government of wales act .
some people want to mislead the people of wales about the scope of this referendum , which shows their inability to formulate constructive arguments on the issue at hand .

we asked two figures on either side of the devolution fence the same key questions to highlight the major issues as they see them .
here plaid cymru am bethan jenkins insists there is no evidence a referendum on full law-making powers would be lost but says it is not time for a " yes " campaign just yet .
why is your campaign so important to you ?
i think it is firstly important to emphasise that a " yes " campaign has not yet been established , that is something that could only happen formally , once the all wales convention has concluded .
the cross-party group i 've been working on is about bringing people together to discuss how a yes campaign best articulates the reasons we need a ' yes ' vote .
what makes you believe many people will take notice of your efforts ?
i believe that people in wales are growing more frustrated at the laborious constitutional process we have to implement to pass the most basic of policies for the good of our communities , and that we are the only country in the uk with such a process .
if a referendum was carried out now what do you think the result would be and why ?
i am heartened by the few opinion polls that have been conducted which show a majority in favour of increased powers and i think that reflects the growing confidence of our people in wanting decisions made closer to home .
but despite this clear trend , i want all of us who believe in the need for change to work hard for it .
i see it as my job to ensure that we make improvements for the people of wales .
how democratic is it to hold a referendum only at a time when one side believes it can win ?
bethan jenkins argues it takes far too long to make welsh laws that in itself is democratic because if there was absolutely no desire for further powers then we could n't be considering a referendum on that issue .
the people of wales are sovereign and it is they who should always have the final say on constitutional change .
would you be willing to support a referendum even if the evidence indicates you are likely to lose , in order to allow people 's voice to be heard ?
there is no evidence to suggest that a referendum would be lost and the all wales convention is currently in our communities , gauging public opinion .
it would be wrong to pre-empt the work of the convention .
if your arguments were to win a referendum would this settle the matter for a generation or more , or would you want further significant changes sooner ?
my party has been consistent on the general principle that the people of wales are sovereign .
they decide on constitutional questions and they decide the pace of constitutional change .
no politician has the right to say " this far and no further " to the people of any nation .
what is the best example of success or failure under the current system to back your argument ?
nearly two years ago , a process started to get powers from westminster which would enable wag -lrb- the welsh assembly government -rrb- to suspend the right to buy council or housing association properties where there are not enough to go round .
today , we 're still no nearer legislating to implement our policy to tackle this serious issue .
such a system is surely unsustainable ?
what future do you foresee for the 40 welsh mps ?
for as long as important decisions are made in westminster that have an effect on the people of wales , we need to ensure our communities have strong representation there .
but of course , i hope that more decisions affecting our communities will be made closer to those communities .
what question do you think people should be asked in the vote ?
" do you believe the national assembly for wales should have primary law-making powers on devolved matters ? "
should people have a chance to vote to abolish the assembly , in order to reflect views fully , and why ?
i personally have always favoured multi-choice referenda , and would have preferred us to have had several options in the original referendum in 1997 .
but i think it is a positive thing that people have a clear choice ahead of them at this referendum , and its pointless re-visiting decisions that the people have already made .
should people also be able to vote for independence and why ?
this is not a vote on independence and the scope of this referendum is limited by the 2006 government of wales act .
some people want to mislead the people of wales about the scope of this referendum , which shows their inability to formulate constructive arguments on the issue at hand .

mps from east yorkshire and northern lincolnshire debated the issue in the house of commons .
they said abolition of the tolls would lead to growth in the area 's economy , but the government said there were more pressing transport demands .
a public inquiry is due to examine a proposed increase in the bridge tolls next week .
the planned rise means car drivers would pay £ 2.90 each way across the bridge , 20p more than current prices .
rises ' wrong ' the conservative mp for beverley and holderness , graham stuart , told mps the tolls were already too high .
he said : " five pounds forty for a return crossing is a significant financial burden .
" increasing the cost of crossing the bridge at a time when unemployment is rising and household budgets are being squeezed would be completely the wrong thing to do and fly in the face of other government policies supposedly to stimulate the economy . "
shona mcisaac , the labour mp for cleethorpes , said research had shown that people would be in favour of paying a more-affordable " token toll " of £ 1 .
and labour mp for great grimsby , austin mitchell , told mps that if the tolls were abolished the treasury would make more in taxes through the growth in the local economy than it currently did through the tolls .
but transport minister paul clark said : " i hear the demands to write off debt to do away with tolls but i have to say that there are many competing demands in terms of the transport requirements in terms of trains , in terms of bus subsidies , in terms of fare subsidies , that have to be met .
" i therefore urge that we have to await the outcome of the public inquiry . "

mps from east yorkshire and northern lincolnshire debated the issue in the house of commons .
they said abolition of the tolls would lead to growth in the area 's economy , but the government said there were more pressing transport demands .
a public inquiry is due to examine a proposed increase in the bridge tolls next week .
the planned rise means car drivers would pay £ 2.90 each way across the bridge , 20p more than current prices .
rises ' wrong ' the conservative mp for beverley and holderness , graham stuart , told mps the tolls were already too high .
he said : " five pounds forty for a return crossing is a significant financial burden .
" increasing the cost of crossing the bridge at a time when unemployment is rising and household budgets are being squeezed would be completely the wrong thing to do and fly in the face of other government policies supposedly to stimulate the economy . "
shona mcisaac , the labour mp for cleethorpes , said research had shown that people would be in favour of paying a more-affordable " token toll " of £ 1 .
and labour mp for great grimsby , austin mitchell , told mps that if the tolls were abolished the treasury would make more in taxes through the growth in the local economy than it currently did through the tolls .
but transport minister paul clark said : " i hear the demands to write off debt to do away with tolls but i have to say that there are many competing demands in terms of the transport requirements in terms of trains , in terms of bus subsidies , in terms of fare subsidies , that have to be met .
" i therefore urge that we have to await the outcome of the public inquiry . "

mps from east yorkshire and northern lincolnshire debated the issue in the house of commons .
they said abolition of the tolls would lead to growth in the area 's economy , but the government said there were more pressing transport demands .
a public inquiry is due to examine a proposed increase in the bridge tolls next week .
the planned rise means car drivers would pay £ 2.90 each way across the bridge , 20p more than current prices .
rises ' wrong ' the conservative mp for beverley and holderness , graham stuart , told mps the tolls were already too high .
he said : " five pounds forty for a return crossing is a significant financial burden .
" increasing the cost of crossing the bridge at a time when unemployment is rising and household budgets are being squeezed would be completely the wrong thing to do and fly in the face of other government policies supposedly to stimulate the economy . "
shona mcisaac , the labour mp for cleethorpes , said research had shown that people would be in favour of paying a more-affordable " token toll " of £ 1 .
and labour mp for great grimsby , austin mitchell , told mps that if the tolls were abolished the treasury would make more in taxes through the growth in the local economy than it currently did through the tolls .
but transport minister paul clark said : " i hear the demands to write off debt to do away with tolls but i have to say that there are many competing demands in terms of the transport requirements in terms of trains , in terms of bus subsidies , in terms of fare subsidies , that have to be met .
" i therefore urge that we have to await the outcome of the public inquiry . "

but for many others those drab cases and standardised components are the blank canvas they use to create something that demands attention - for its looks and raw computational power .
" it 's a cross between performance and aesthetics , " said david penfold , who has turned many of those drab cases and chugging components into something far greater .
his latest creation , called overclocked orange , consumed months of his spare time as he built it and then tuned it to get the best performance .
benchmarking tools helped , said mr penfold , and were a key part of making the machine stable and useable .

advertisement watercoolinguk 's rob creathorne says liquid cooling systems can give computers a lot of zest overclocked orange is no skittish pureblood good for only a mad dash over a short distance followed by a collapse into exhaustion .
it 's a working machine that mr penfold has tested and tweaked to be as stable as a factory-bought clone , if not more so .
" it 's a media server , i use it for work and playing games , " he said .
" there 's not a day goes by that i 'm not on my pc . "
at the heart of the orange monster is one of the latest intel i7 quad core chips accelerated , or overclocked , to 3.99ghz.
it has 6gb triple channel ddr of ram , and alongside that sit three overclocked nvidia gtx280 graphics cards .
it has four terabytes of storage for games , movies and music .
it has a dual-loop water-cooling system plumbed throughout the case to take away the heat generated by the feverish processor and graphics cards .
" you can get stock air coolers but they are never going to be able to shift as much heat as a decent water set up , " he said , adding that water-cooling has another advantage - less noise .
the finished machine sits on the desk in the computer room in his home and its glowing orange innards , bright chrome fittings and sheer size make it dominate the room .

" if you were into liquid cooling your computer 4-5 years ago you would not have been able to buy a case and put all that stuff in it , " he said .
" you would have had to drill the holes yourself to fit the radiators in . "
in the early days of case modding and overclocking , said mr penfold , many people scavenged parts such as pumps from fish tanks or shopped in diy stores for the bits they needed .
the rising popularity of the net has also helped , said mr penfold , as it is now much easier to find people who can answer questions or have had similar experiences .
there is another reason that overclocking is proving popular , said steven dodd , an experienced pc builder despite still being a teenager .
" overclocking is free , " he said .
" you do not need to go out and buy an upgrade to get more performance . "
mr dodd built his first pc at 13 but his most recent project was very ambitious and involved him building the case for the computer himself from 3mm thick acrylic sheets .
the aero design , as he called it , took about six months to finish .
the inspiration for embarking on the project was the gift of a samsung flat panel tv that has a pc input .
mr dodd wanted a pc that could act as a media server but did not look like the common or garden desktop pc .
his lack of funds led to him seeking sponsors to supply parts .
five firms responded to the 150 or so e-mails he sent out and eventually chip maker amd , storage firm seagate and memory specialist crucial donated parts .
fans can help but purists prefer to water-cool their computers " without them , " said mr dodd , " i probably would still be saving up for parts now . "
also key to the build were friends he made on the forums of ccl computers who acted as a sounding board as the project rolled on .
the properties of the acrylic sheets and design he chose to cut into it proved tricky to complete .
while building the machine , he said , he learned a lot about working with acrylic and he used a lot of vaseline to cool drill bits and blades used to shape the sheets .
" sometimes i did think ' why am i doing this ?
why do n't i go out and buy a case ? " ' he said .
" but i liked the challenge , i like having something of mine that no-one else would have , " he said , adding " i also wanted it to match the telly .
i 'm a bit of a perfectionist like that . "
while all the parts went in the aero case were standard , mr dodd did have to make some adjustments to the power supply .
" i 'd heard it was loud , " he said . " when i turned it on it was incredibly loud and i had to open it up and replace the fan . "
the difficult creation process has only slightly dented his enthusiasm for modifying pcs .
" i will do it again , " he said , " but not soon . "

" if you were into liquid cooling your computer 4-5 years ago you would not have been able to buy a case and put all that stuff in it , " he said .

in the early days of case modding and overclocking , said mr penfold , many people scavenged parts such as pumps from fish tanks or shopped in diy stores for the bits they needed .

the aero design , as he called it , took about six months to finish .
the inspiration for embarking on the project was the gift of a samsung flat panel tv that has a pc input .
mr dodd wanted a pc that could act as a media server but did not look like the common or garden desktop pc .
his lack of funds led to him seeking sponsors to supply parts .

in the early days of case modding and overclocking , said mr penfold , many people scavenged parts such as pumps from fish tanks or shopped in diy stores for the bits they needed .

the aero design , as he called it , took about six months to finish .
the inspiration for embarking on the project was the gift of a samsung flat panel tv that has a pc input .
mr dodd wanted a pc that could act as a media server but did not look like the common or garden desktop pc .
his lack of funds led to him seeking sponsors to supply parts .

also key to the build were friends he made on the forums of ccl computers who acted as a sounding board as the project rolled on .
the properties of the acrylic sheets and design he chose to cut into it proved tricky to complete .
while building the machine , he said , he learned a lot about working with acrylic and he used a lot of vaseline to cool drill bits and blades used to shape the sheets .
" sometimes i did think ' why am i doing this ?

while all the parts went in the aero case were standard , mr dodd did have to make some adjustments to the power supply .

some suspect this is part of an attempt by hardline mugabe supporters to scuttle the agreement .
catherine meredith , 40 , tells the bbc what happened to her farm . "
on february 6 , a crowd of 30 men showed up on our land .
most of them were young , many of them wearing -lsb- president mugabe 's -rsb- zanu-pf t-shirts .
i was away in south africa visiting my son at university but my husband had stayed behind .
we had a feeling that something could happen so we decided one of us should stay .
they told my husband that our farm was now being taken over by a local businessman .
their manner was boastful and arrogant .
when i came back from south africa a few days later , i was advised by the french embassy not to return to the farm -lrb- i 'm originally from france -rrb- .
this is because in 2008 there were similar invasions of white-owned farms and it got quite violent .
back then , there were people threatening to kill us and we had to leave our farm for some time .
this time , there was less violence , but i was in touch with my staff on the mobile from harare .
they told me the invaders had been menacing towards them and stopped them from working .
this made my staff very angry , but they were under strict instructions from me not to lose it .
' rent-a-crowd ' after a week , my husband and i returned to the farm .
in the meantime we had obtained a court order in harare saying the squatters had no right to our land .
the crowd was still there .
the atmosphere was very tense , very unpleasant .
we calmly handed the eviction papers to the leader of the pack .
we want to follow the law by the letter .
the local sheriff was with us .
he explained to them that they had no right to be there .
they kept saying they had n't been violent .
but that is n't true .
last week they seized a member of my staff and pushed his face to the ground to get him to hand over the keys to our garden gate .
then , 17 of them broke into our garden .
luckily , the police for once stuck up for us and prevented them from breaking into our house .
these squatters are arbitrary people who have been paid to squat on our farm .
we call them ' rent-a-crowd ' .
but generally the local police have n't been very helpful .
despite the eviction order , they have n't tried to force the squatters off our land .
they claim they have n't got the manpower to help us .
' greedy people ' there are several reasons why these people have invaded our land now , just as a new unity government emerges .
either it 's a last push from zanu-pf to seize all commercial white farms . "
the businessman who ordered the invasion is a zanu-pf member - he seems to be a collector of farms " or it 's an attempt by the old regime to endanger the new government and show that it is n't working .
or it 's just the last attempt of a group of greedy people who do n't own their own farm to grab one from others .
although the men that invaded our farm were wearing zanu-pf t-shirts , it does n't necessarily mean they are members of the party .
they might just be one of the few t-shirts they own - zanu has handed out so many .
but the businessman who ordered the invasion is a zanu-pf member .
he seems to be a collector of farms - he already owns three others that he has taken by force .
financially this has cost us a great deal .
the man who ordered the crowd to seize our land has allowed his cattle to walk through our maize fields .
this has partly destroyed our crops .
emotionally , it 's absolutely draining .
you think you are protected by the law and then this happens .
all of our children are grown up and have moved away and thank goodness for that .
otherwise we would have to worry about their safety as well .
on the surface , this invasion seems more peaceful than the one last year .
but there are still about 12 of them on our land and you never know what they are capable of .

some suspect this is part of an attempt by hardline mugabe supporters to scuttle the agreement .
catherine meredith , 40 , tells the bbc what happened to her farm .
on february 6 , a crowd of 30 men showed up on our land .
most of them were young , many of them wearing -lsb- president mugabe 's -rsb- zanu-pf t-shirts .
i was away in south africa visiting my son at university but my husband had stayed behind .
we had a feeling that something could happen so we decided one of us should stay .
they told my husband that our farm was now being taken over by a local businessman .
their manner was boastful and arrogant .
when i came back from south africa a few days later , i was advised by the french embassy not to return to the farm -lrb- i 'm originally from france -rrb- .
this is because in 2008 there were similar invasions of white-owned farms and it got quite violent .
back then , there were people threatening to kill us and we had to leave our farm for some time .
this time , there was less violence , but i was in touch with my staff on the mobile from harare .
they told me the invaders had been menacing towards them and stopped them from working .
this made my staff very angry , but they were under strict instructions from me not to lose it .
' rent-a-crowd ' after a week , my husband and i returned to the farm .
in the meantime we had obtained a court order in harare saying the squatters had no right to our land .
past farm occupations by so-called war veterans have turned violent the crowd was still there .
the atmosphere was very tense , very unpleasant .
we calmly handed the eviction papers to the leader of the pack .
we want to follow the law by the letter .
the local sheriff was with us .
he explained to them that they had no right to be there .
they kept saying they had n't been violent .
but that is n't true .
last week they seized a member of my staff and pushed his face to the ground to get him to hand over the keys to our garden gate .
then , 17 of them broke into our garden .
luckily , the police for once stuck up for us and prevented them from breaking into our house .
these squatters are arbitrary people who have been paid to squat on our farm .
we call them ' rent-a-crowd ' .
but generally the local police have n't been very helpful .
despite the eviction order , they have n't tried to force the squatters off our land .
they claim they have n't got the manpower to help us .
' greedy people ' there are several reasons why these people have invaded our land now , just as a new unity government emerges .
either it 's a last push from zanu-pf to seize all commercial white farms .
the businessman who ordered the invasion is a zanu-pf member - he seems to be a collector of farms or it 's an attempt by the old regime to endanger the new government and show that it is n't working .
or it 's just the last attempt of a group of greedy people who do n't own their own farm to grab one from others .
although the men that invaded our farm were wearing zanu-pf t-shirts , it does n't necessarily mean they are members of the party .
they might just be one of the few t-shirts they own - zanu has handed out so many .
but the businessman who ordered the invasion is a zanu-pf member .
he seems to be a collector of farms - he already owns three others that he has taken by force .
financially this has cost us a great deal .
the man who ordered the crowd to seize our land has allowed his cattle to walk through our maize fields .
this has partly destroyed our crops .
emotionally , it 's absolutely draining .
you think you are protected by the law and then this happens .
all of our children are grown up and have moved away and thank goodness for that .
otherwise we would have to worry about their safety as well .
on the surface , this invasion seems more peaceful than the one last year .
but there are still about 12 of them on our land and you never know what they are capable of .
they drink and smoke pot quite a bit , and it worries me .
i have lived here since i was 23 .
zimbabwe is my home now , i would n't know where else to go .
my husband was born in this area and he speaks shona .
we belong here .
we are not giving up .
we strongly believe that change is coming to zimbabwe .
my feeling is that we are very near the end of these troubles .
we have a new prime minister now .
i 'm 100 % confident that in five years ' time , i 'll still be living on this farm .
