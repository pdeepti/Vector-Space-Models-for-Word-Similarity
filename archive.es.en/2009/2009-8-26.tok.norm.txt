they ’ ve been divided since the koran war ended in 1953 . contact by phone or by post is not permitted . since 2000 , there have been 16 rounds of face to face reunions , and several via video conference . the last gathering was in 2007 .

in september , washington ’ s point man to north korea , stephen bosworth , will visit east asia . there is speculation that his agenda will also include a stop in pyongyang . timothy savage , deputy director of the nautilus institute ’ s seoul branch , says south korea needs to keep pace with the us when dealing with pyongyang .
" if south korea is too adamant about sticking to its guns and doesn ’ t rebuild some sort of relationship , some sort of ongoing project with the north , there is a good chance they could end up sidelined and that would not be in south korea ’ s own interest . "
for now , the barack obama administration says that it will not engage one on one with north korea over its nuclear program , unless pyongyang first returns to multilateral talks with its neighbours .

they are discussing the resumption of reunions for separated families .
following a series of apparent good will gestures from pyongyang , some analysts say now is the time for south korea and the us to re-engage the north . a team of south korean delegates departed on wednesday morning for the mt .
kumgang resort in north korea .
there they are meeting with officials from pyongyang to work out the details for the next round of family reunions .
kim young-chol leads seoul ’ s delegation . he says his team will try to ensure that during the next round of reunions as many elderly south koreans as possible will have the opportunity to meet with their separated relatives . thousands of divided families according to the korean red cross , the organisation which oversees the reunions , 600,000 south koreans have relatives in the north .
they ’ ve been divided since the koran war ended in 1953 . contact by phone or by post is not permitted . since 2000 , there have been 16 rounds of face to face reunions , and several via video conference . the last gathering was in 2007 .
that is because pyongyang called off reunions in protest over seoul ’ s halting of financial aid last year . but after months of hostile rhetoric as well as a long range rocket and nuclear test , the kim jong-il regime appears to be offering an olive branch . re-engaging pyongyang over the weekend , north korea dispatched representatives to pay respects to the late south korean leader kim dae-jung , who began the engagement strategy known as the sunshine policy a decade ago .
pyongyang has also offered to restart joint tourism ventures with seoul and freed a detained south korean engineer at a co-owned factory in the north . moon chung-in is a professor in politics at seoul ’ s yonsei university . he says that south korean president lee myung-bak must re-engage pyongyang and drop his demand that north korea ends its nuclear weapons program first . " if denuclearization is a precondition for the resumption of the sunshine policy or engagement policy , then the lee myung-bak government is bound to fail . " washington ’ s role moon says the time is also right for washington to hold talks with north korea .
" what the north korean leadership thinks is very simple and straightforward : they believe if there are improved washington-pyongyang ties , then seoul-pyongyang ties will automatically improve . "
in september , washington ’ s point man to north korea , stephen bosworth , will visit east asia . there is speculation that his agenda will also include a stop in pyongyang . timothy savage , deputy director of the nautilus institute ’ s seoul branch , says south korea needs to keep pace with the us when dealing with pyongyang .
" if south korea is too adamant about sticking to its guns and doesn ’ t rebuild some sort of relationship , some sort of ongoing project with the north , there is a good chance they could end up sidelined and that would not be in south korea ’ s own interest . "
for now , the barack obama administration says that it will not engage one on one with north korea over its nuclear program , unless pyongyang first returns to multilateral talks with its neighbours .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .

" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .
on tuesday , netanyahu met with brown , with whom he discussed his own vision of israeli-palestinian peace .
the israeli 's " three-track " approach calls for a crackdown on palestinian militants , improved economic development and a demilitarized palestine. hf / afp / dpa / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .
" in that regard there 's nothing scandalous or surprising about it , " he added .

the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .
" that price is anything but fair , " said ulrich hocker , chief of germany 's dsw private investors ' association , which plans to challenge the forced sale in court .
hre shares were worth more than 57 euros in early 2006 and have since lost about 98 percent of their value. sje / dpa / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .

there they are meeting with officials from pyongyang to work out the details for the next round of family reunions .
kim young-chol leads seoul ’ s delegation . he says his team will try to ensure that during the next round of reunions as many elderly south koreans as possible will have the opportunity to meet with their separated relatives . thousands of divided families according to the korean red cross , the organisation which oversees the reunions , 600,000 south koreans have relatives in the north .
they ’ ve been divided since the koran war ended in 1953 . contact by phone or by post is not permitted . since 2000 , there have been 16 rounds of face to face reunions , and several via video conference . the last gathering was in 2007 .
that is because pyongyang called off reunions in protest over seoul ’ s halting of financial aid last year . but after months of hostile rhetoric as well as a long range rocket and nuclear test , the kim jong-il regime appears to be offering an olive branch . re-engaging pyongyang over the weekend , north korea dispatched representatives to pay respects to the late south korean leader kim dae-jung , who began the engagement strategy known as the sunshine policy a decade ago .

in september , washington ’ s point man to north korea , stephen bosworth , will visit east asia . there is speculation that his agenda will also include a stop in pyongyang . timothy savage , deputy director of the nautilus institute ’ s seoul branch , says south korea needs to keep pace with the us when dealing with pyongyang .
" if south korea is too adamant about sticking to its guns and doesn ’ t rebuild some sort of relationship , some sort of ongoing project with the north , there is a good chance they could end up sidelined and that would not be in south korea ’ s own interest . "
for now , the barack obama administration says that it will not engage one on one with north korea over its nuclear program , unless pyongyang first returns to multilateral talks with its neighbours .

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .

the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .
" that price is anything but fair , " said ulrich hocker , chief of germany 's dsw private investors ' association , which plans to challenge the forced sale in court .

there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .

g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "

bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .

figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 26.08.2009 separatist caucasus regions go separate ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how jubliant are the separatists a year into their proclaimed independence ?
one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

he scored two first-half goals , after kamil kosowski had given the hosts an early lead .
the london side arsenal beat celtic 3-1 in a tie billed in some media as the battle of britain and cruised into the group stage 5-1 on aggregate .
the final place in the group stage went to greek giants olympiakos , who beat unfancied moldovan side sheriff 1-0 and thus go through on a 3-0 aggregate .
on tuesday , olympique lyon , maccabi haifa , debrecen , fc zurich and atletico madrid progressed to the group stage , at the expense of anderlecht , salzburg , levski sofia , ventspils and panathinaikos respectively. av / jk / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .

shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.08.2009 vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough shots for everybody - health ministers are planning to order enough doses for a third of the population failing to reach agreement over funding the german government 's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties .
experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .
" this method is safer compared to what the europeans and germany are doing " , he added .
the latter 's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu .

" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

the final place in the group stage went to greek giants olympiakos , who beat unfancied moldovan side sheriff 1-0 and thus go through on a 3-0 aggregate .

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.08.2009 vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough shots for everybody - health ministers are planning to order enough doses for a third of the population failing to reach agreement over funding the german government 's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties .
experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .
" this method is safer compared to what the europeans and germany are doing " , he added .
the latter 's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .
on tuesday , netanyahu met with brown , with whom he discussed his own vision of israeli-palestinian peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2009 governments struggle to combat piracy with legal measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few western nations are willing to arrest and prosecute suspected pirates nabbed by their navies western nations have spent millions to arm their navies patroling the lawless shipping lanes off the somali coast .
but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

the london side arsenal beat celtic 3-1 in a tie billed in some media as the battle of britain and cruised into the group stage 5-1 on aggregate .

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.08.2009 government could shift position on opel sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's fate remains unclear after gm rejected magna 's offer for the company the german government may make several major concessions in order to secure a sale of general motors ' opel unit , according to media reports on wednesday . the biggest concession is that the government may be willing to accept a bid from the belgium-based investment fund rhj international instead of its preferred partner , canadian auto parts maker magna , according to unnamed sources cited by the a mass-circulation bild newspaper .
last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

he scored two first-half goals , after kamil kosowski had given the hosts an early lead .
the london side arsenal beat celtic 3-1 in a tie billed in some media as the battle of britain and cruised into the group stage 5-1 on aggregate .
the final place in the group stage went to greek giants olympiakos , who beat unfancied moldovan side sheriff 1-0 and thus go through on a 3-0 aggregate .
on tuesday , olympique lyon , maccabi haifa , debrecen , fc zurich and atletico madrid progressed to the group stage , at the expense of anderlecht , salzburg , levski sofia , ventspils and panathinaikos respectively. av / jk / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 26.08.2009 mideast peace efforts revived as europe increases pressure on israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel will attempt to get concessions from benjamin netanyahu on israel 's settlement policy chancellor angela merkel has joined other world leaders in urging israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to freeze the jewish settlements in the palestinian territories .
but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .

but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2009 governments struggle to combat piracy with legal measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few western nations are willing to arrest and prosecute suspected pirates nabbed by their navies western nations have spent millions to arm their navies patroling the lawless shipping lanes off the somali coast .
but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2009 governments struggle to combat piracy with legal measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few western nations are willing to arrest and prosecute suspected pirates nabbed by their navies western nations have spent millions to arm their navies patroling the lawless shipping lanes off the somali coast .
but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .

public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .
" this method is safer compared to what the europeans and germany are doing " , he added .
the latter 's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 26.08.2009 separatist caucasus regions go separate ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how jubliant are the separatists a year into their proclaimed independence ?
one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2009 governments struggle to combat piracy with legal measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few western nations are willing to arrest and prosecute suspected pirates nabbed by their navies western nations have spent millions to arm their navies patroling the lawless shipping lanes off the somali coast .
but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .
the issue of market regulation is sure to be high on the agenda at the summit of group of 20 nations in the us city of pittsburgh in late september .
g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "
" france will propose that all the great financial centers of the g20 adopt the rules for transparency , oversight and responsibility that are now in place on the paris market , " he said .
the issue is also expected to be discussed when sarkozy meets with german chancellor angela merkel next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy will seek to convince g20 members next month new restrictions for french banks sarkozy announced tougher controls for french banks after meeting with financial executives at the elysee palace in paris on tuesday .
sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .
bonuses at bnp paribas the issue of bank bonuses resurfaced recently when it was revealed that bnp paribas had set aside one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- for possible bonuses after it reported a rise of 6.6 percent in its second quarter profits .
baudoin prot , the ceo of bnp paribas , who is taking over as head of the french banking federation , said that french banks would comply with the president 's new banking rules , but added that the rules would have to be adopted globally if they were to have a significant effect. ca / av / reuters / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .

" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .
the issue of market regulation is sure to be high on the agenda at the summit of group of 20 nations in the us city of pittsburgh in late september .
g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "
" france will propose that all the great financial centers of the g20 adopt the rules for transparency , oversight and responsibility that are now in place on the paris market , " he said .
the issue is also expected to be discussed when sarkozy meets with german chancellor angela merkel next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy will seek to convince g20 members next month new restrictions for french banks sarkozy announced tougher controls for french banks after meeting with financial executives at the elysee palace in paris on tuesday .
sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .
bonuses at bnp paribas the issue of bank bonuses resurfaced recently when it was revealed that bnp paribas had set aside one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- for possible bonuses after it reported a rise of 6.6 percent in its second quarter profits .
baudoin prot , the ceo of bnp paribas , who is taking over as head of the french banking federation , said that french banks would comply with the president 's new banking rules , but added that the rules would have to be adopted globally if they were to have a significant effect. ca / av / reuters / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 26.08.2009 governments struggle to combat piracy with legal measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few western nations are willing to arrest and prosecute suspected pirates nabbed by their navies western nations have spent millions to arm their navies patroling the lawless shipping lanes off the somali coast .
but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

the final place in the group stage went to greek giants olympiakos , who beat unfancied moldovan side sheriff 1-0 and thus go through on a 3-0 aggregate .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .
on tuesday , netanyahu met with brown , with whom he discussed his own vision of israeli-palestinian peace .

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .
" in that regard there 's nothing scandalous or surprising about it , " he added .

the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .
" that price is anything but fair , " said ulrich hocker , chief of germany 's dsw private investors ' association , which plans to challenge the forced sale in court .
hre shares were worth more than 57 euros in early 2006 and have since lost about 98 percent of their value. sje / dpa / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

he scored two first-half goals , after kamil kosowski had given the hosts an early lead .
the london side arsenal beat celtic 3-1 in a tie billed in some media as the battle of britain and cruised into the group stage 5-1 on aggregate .

but experts say legal efforts to deter pirates are lagging because of complex laws and logistics . last week , a german warship apprehended a pirate boat near the somali coast and found ak-47 assault rifles , ammunition and anti-tank weapons on board .
despite the explosive discovery , the pirates went free after being disarmed . the incident is not an isolated one .
in recent years , foreign navies policing the waters off the somali coast have detained several ships operated by armed sea gangs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a surge in pirate attacks off the coast of somalia has prompted western nations to arm their navies in the area but most have been released after having their weapons confiscated and few suspected pirates have been put on trial , underlining the legal difficulties involved in their prosecutions . experts say such leniency sends the wrong signals to would-be sea robbers . “ you can ’ t just take away the pirates ’ weapons and allow them to go scot-free .
pirates are like any other criminals .
they ’ ll just get other weapons and attempt the same thing again , ” michael stehr from the bonn-based german maritime institute , told deutsche welle .
“ legal deterrence is vital - without it the whole fight against piracy is threatened . ” piracy attacks around the world , in particular on the vast shipping lanes linking asia and europe near the somali coast , have risen sharply .
they more than doubled to 240 from 114 during the first six months of this year , according to the icc international martime bureau ’ s piracy reporting center . confusing and disparate laws the united nations law of the sea convention defines piracy as a universal crime and each of the 158 states that have signed the treaty may arrest pirates at sea and prosecute them at home .
but many countries have not fully incorporated this into their national legislation . some countries such as denmark and canada have no provisions in their penal codes to treat piracy as a punishable offence .
others like germany - which operates under the eu anti-piracy mission atalanta off the coast of somalia - can only make arrests if its own interests are affected . “ the legal prosecution of pirates in germany is possible if a german ship is attacked , if the victims are german or if the attack results in a huge economic loss , ” uwe jenisch , a maritime expert at the walter schücking institute of international law in the northern german city of kiel , told deutsche welle . “ the final decision is up to a government committee which looks into prosecution on a case by case basis . ” pirates in the dock experts say these huge differences over laws concerning the arrest of pirates has resulted in only a few western nations willing to conduct trials of suspected pirates . in may this year , five suspected somali pirates nabbed by the danish navy went on trial in a court in the netherlands .
in the same month , a somali teenager , the sole-surviving accused pirate from an attack on an american container ship , was indicted in the us on ten counts . some point out that building a legal case against suspected pirates reflects the difficulties many nations find themselves in when deciding what to with a suspected pirate once they are arrested . gathering evidence , assembling witnesses who are often far out at sea and of different nationalities and the logistical and legal burdens in transporting pirate suspects to western countries remains daunting , according to cyrus mody from the london-based international maritime bureau . “ getting everything in place - the evidence , the witnesses and paying for the process - is difficult enough , ” mody told deutsche welle . “ but the other big concern in western nations is that if the pirates are held here until the lengthy trial is completed , they could apply for asylum . ” concern over kenya pirate trials that 's one reason why a number of western governments - including the us and within the european union - have signed agreements with somalia ’ s neighbor kenya on the transfer of suspected somali pirates for trial in the african country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say western nations are shirking their responsibilities by transferring suspected pirates to african nations for trial the practice has been strongly criticized by legal experts and rights groups who say kenya ’ s dubious human rights record means it can not guarantee a fair trial . “ it ’ s very convenient for western nations to just wash their hands off the pirates by handing them over to kenya and thus avoid potential legal headaches , ” jenisch said .
“ but morally , it ’ s a very questionable practice . ” according to jenisch , around 130 pirate suspects have been transferred to kenya this year alone . international piracy court in hamburg ? the legal challenges posed by 21st century piracy has prompted several nations to call for an international court to be established to deal with the prosecutions .
the option is viewed by many as costly and judicially cumbersome . germany is debating conducting pirate prosecutions at the international tribunal for the law of the sea , an independent judicial body based in hamburg with close links to the un . legal experts say the hamburg court , which hears disputes between states over the un law of the sea convention , would need a new mandate to conduct pirate prosecutions - a process that could take years and long negotiations between un member states . but some point out that ultimately , legal tools to deter pirates remain a secondary option at best . " it 's much more important that western nations try to find a political solution to the underlying conflicts within somalia if they are really interested in stamping out piracy , " jenisch said . author : sonia phalnikar editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .
" in that regard there 's nothing scandalous or surprising about it , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck is n't surprised to hear hre needs more capital hre has already received more than 100 billion euros in government loans and state guarantees , prompting berlin to buy up 90 percent of the company 's stock .
the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .
" that price is anything but fair , " said ulrich hocker , chief of germany 's dsw private investors ' association , which plans to challenge the forced sale in court .
hre shares were worth more than 57 euros in early 2006 and have since lost about 98 percent of their value. sje / dpa / afp / ap editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .
the issue of market regulation is sure to be high on the agenda at the summit of group of 20 nations in the us city of pittsburgh in late september .
g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "
" france will propose that all the great financial centers of the g20 adopt the rules for transparency , oversight and responsibility that are now in place on the paris market , " he said .
the issue is also expected to be discussed when sarkozy meets with german chancellor angela merkel next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy will seek to convince g20 members next month new restrictions for french banks sarkozy announced tougher controls for french banks after meeting with financial executives at the elysee palace in paris on tuesday .
sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .
bonuses at bnp paribas the issue of bank bonuses resurfaced recently when it was revealed that bnp paribas had set aside one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- for possible bonuses after it reported a rise of 6.6 percent in its second quarter profits .
baudoin prot , the ceo of bnp paribas , who is taking over as head of the french banking federation , said that french banks would comply with the president 's new banking rules , but added that the rules would have to be adopted globally if they were to have a significant effect. ca / av / reuters / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .

the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .
negotiations between gm and the german government are set to resume friday , the state economy minister of thuringia , juergen reinholz , told bloomberg news. bn / ap / dpa / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .

the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.08.2009 government could shift position on opel sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's fate remains unclear after gm rejected magna 's offer for the company the german government may make several major concessions in order to secure a sale of general motors ' opel unit , according to media reports on wednesday . the biggest concession is that the government may be willing to accept a bid from the belgium-based investment fund rhj international instead of its preferred partner , canadian auto parts maker magna , according to unnamed sources cited by the a mass-circulation bild newspaper .
last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .
negotiations between gm and the german government are set to resume friday , the state economy minister of thuringia , juergen reinholz , told bloomberg news. bn / ap / dpa / reuters editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .
" gm 's future concept of opel envisions among other things the closing of eisenach , bochum or antwerp , and beyond that dramatic cuts in personnel and capping investment , " said klaus franz , chair of opel 's works council , in an interview with the die welt newspaper . with elections just one month away , the opel sale has also become a political football for german politicians on the campaign trail . the center-left social democratic party , which is currently the junior partner in a coalition with merkel 's christian democrats and is lagging far behind in the polls , is hoping to use merkel 's handling of the sale to demonstrate why she should not be given another term as chancellor . the spd has also made zu guttenberg , who belongs to the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , as a target for criticism . " i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.08.2009 vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough shots for everybody - health ministers are planning to order enough doses for a third of the population failing to reach agreement over funding the german government 's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties .
experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .
" this method is safer compared to what the europeans and germany are doing " , he added .
the latter 's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 26.08.2009 mideast peace efforts revived as europe increases pressure on israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel will attempt to get concessions from benjamin netanyahu on israel 's settlement policy chancellor angela merkel has joined other world leaders in urging israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to freeze the jewish settlements in the palestinian territories .
but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .

officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .

out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .

" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .

the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "

netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

the final place in the group stage went to greek giants olympiakos , who beat unfancied moldovan side sheriff 1-0 and thus go through on a 3-0 aggregate .

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .
the issue of market regulation is sure to be high on the agenda at the summit of group of 20 nations in the us city of pittsburgh in late september .
g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "
" france will propose that all the great financial centers of the g20 adopt the rules for transparency , oversight and responsibility that are now in place on the paris market , " he said .
the issue is also expected to be discussed when sarkozy meets with german chancellor angela merkel next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy will seek to convince g20 members next month new restrictions for french banks sarkozy announced tougher controls for french banks after meeting with financial executives at the elysee palace in paris on tuesday .
sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.08.2009 government could shift position on opel sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's fate remains unclear after gm rejected magna 's offer for the company the german government may make several major concessions in order to secure a sale of general motors ' opel unit , according to media reports on wednesday . the biggest concession is that the government may be willing to accept a bid from the belgium-based investment fund rhj international instead of its preferred partner , canadian auto parts maker magna , according to unnamed sources cited by the a mass-circulation bild newspaper .
last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .
political football after making concessions worth 100 million euros for a deal with magna , unions representing opel workers are upset by gm 's change of heart and say it could lead to plant closures across europe .

" i believe that mr. zu guttenberg also carries part of the responsibility in that he has sent very different signals towards america , " said spd economy spokeswoman ute berg on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 26.08.2009 france to push g20 to curb banker bonuses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says he wants banks to be punished if they do n't apply new rules french president nicolas sarkozy says he will push g20 nations to accept tougher controls on bonuses for bankers .
the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .
the issue of market regulation is sure to be high on the agenda at the summit of group of 20 nations in the us city of pittsburgh in late september .
g20 finance ministers are also meeting in london at the beginning of the month and banking controls are to be one of the top issues on the agenda .
there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .
" obviously the question of bonuses can not be handled by france alone , " sarkozy said .
" but that is no reason to sit and do nothing . "
" france will propose that all the great financial centers of the g20 adopt the rules for transparency , oversight and responsibility that are now in place on the paris market , " he said .
the issue is also expected to be discussed when sarkozy meets with german chancellor angela merkel next week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy will seek to convince g20 members next month new restrictions for french banks sarkozy announced tougher controls for french banks after meeting with financial executives at the elysee palace in paris on tuesday .
sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .
bonuses at bnp paribas the issue of bank bonuses resurfaced recently when it was revealed that bnp paribas had set aside one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.43 billion -rrb- for possible bonuses after it reported a rise of 6.6 percent in its second quarter profits .
baudoin prot , the ceo of bnp paribas , who is taking over as head of the french banking federation , said that french banks would comply with the president 's new banking rules , but added that the rules would have to be adopted globally if they were to have a significant effect. ca / av / reuters / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.08.2009 government could shift position on opel sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's fate remains unclear after gm rejected magna 's offer for the company the german government may make several major concessions in order to secure a sale of general motors ' opel unit , according to media reports on wednesday . the biggest concession is that the government may be willing to accept a bid from the belgium-based investment fund rhj international instead of its preferred partner , canadian auto parts maker magna , according to unnamed sources cited by the a mass-circulation bild newspaper .
last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
“ what we 're currently hearing from general motors is that they 're still interested in an investor solution . ”
gm wants to maintain control bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union leaders fear opel 's eisenach factory could be closed if gm continues as opel 's owner german chancellor angela merkel and her government have played a central role in the rescue of opel , which is currently being kept afloat with a 1.5 billion euro state bridging loan .
shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .
on tuesday , netanyahu met with brown , with whom he discussed his own vision of israeli-palestinian peace .

one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 26.08.2009 separatist caucasus regions go separate ways großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how jubliant are the separatists a year into their proclaimed independence ?
one year has passed since russia officially recognised the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
but as the rest of the world stands by its refusal to follow suit , genuine sovereignty is still out of reach . if a day is a long time in politics , then a year is an eternity and ample opportunity for new beginnings .
and although both south ossetia and abkhazia have experienced some fundamental changes since the russia-georgia war last august , neither region holds the key to its own fate .
those are now firmly in the hands of moscow , something which for its part , south ossetia has welcomed whole-heartedly .
with its predominantly uncultivated mountain terrain , the region has nothing like the kind of infrastructure it would need to sustain itself .
" more than 90 percent of south ossetia 's budget comes directly from moscow , " lawrence sheet , caucasus project director of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
but he said the issue of russian dominance does not seem to trouble the area 's some 40,000 inhabitants .
" there is no home-grown movement for full independence , " sheet said .
" the remaining population seem to be happy to be a part of russia . "
russian brothers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south ossetia de facto leader , eduard kokoity indeed , south ossetia 's de facto ruler , eduard kokoity , recently told the reuters newsagency that he would work with russia to build a statehood .
" we do n't rule out that there will come a time when we will become part of russia , " he said .
alexander rahr , director of the russian program at the german council on foreign relations said the south ossetians feel safer , both in economic and military terms , now that they are clearly in russian hands .
" people are getting help from moscow , " rahr told deutsche welle .
" the money is real , so economically they are winning . "
and with any threat of a georgian military strike removed by the presence of russian troops in the area , rahr says there is also a feeling of greater security among south ossetians .
that same sense of military protection goes for the people of abkhazia , but that is where the similarities between the two separatist regions end .
abkhaz independence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black sea coast is popular with russian tourists when moscow officially recognised the breakaway entity as an independent state , the sense of elation fuelled abkhaz dreams of carving a sovereign future from its fertile land and pretty black sea coastline . only that is not what has happened .
the world has honoured its recognition of georgian territorial integrity , thereby leaving abkhazia with but one notable ally .
and although abkhazia is not wrapped quite so tightly in russia 's arms as south ossetia , it still relies on moscow for 50 percent of its budget and 99 percent of its trade .
consequently , the elation felt this time last year has morphed into an increasing sense of discontent among the abkhaz people , and the political elite is now in the difficult position of trying to achieve sovereignty without biting the hand which feeds it .
international distance successfully pulling off that tightrope walk would require some help from outside , and as alexander rahr points out , europe and the rest of the world are not willing to get involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow is where the money is " the eu has understood that it can not fight russia in this region , " he said , adding that without saying so , europe has accepted that moscow is now responsible for abkhazia and south ossetia .
so abkhazia is in a classic catch-22 .
without any western presence in the region , the situation is unlikely to change , and until there is a change , there will be no western presence .
" it is a bit of a dead end , " said lawrence sheet .
" the only way abkhazia can realistcally grow at this juncture is as an appendage of the russian federation . "
he says becoming truly independent will require a whole lot of abkhaz patience because it will likely take " a generational change " to break the status quo . author : tamsin walker editor : robert mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will that make an impression on netanyahu ? earlier this week in talks with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london , benjamin netanyahu made it clear that he wants to avoid creating new hurdles for the peace process .
but in return for giving up settlements , he 's making certain demands .
" the israelis have proven four years ago , when they evacuated all of the gaza strip , " analyst gil yaron told deutsche welle , " that they are willing to pay a price , if they think that a better future will follow .
but the israeli experience with these kind of removals has been very bitter . "
silke tempel , the editor-in-chief of the german council 's of foreign relations bimonthly magazine internationale politik -lrb- international politics -rrb- agreed that over the past years the palestinians in gaza have only made things worse .
" after the withdrawal from gaza , " she said , " israel got a whole range of rocket attacks .
that really did not help .
it took all the courage away from left-wing politicians . "
palestinian divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in return for palestinian security guarantees many israelis would approve an end to the settlements and yet , yaron is convinced that most israelis remain interested in a deal with the palestinians .
" should they be presented with something tangible , something that promises them security and an end of conflict , " he said , " then i think that the majority of israelis would back a removal of settlements , even if that entails a confrontation with the settlers ' movement . "
even though she does n't see any other alternative , tempel is not very optimistic about the likelihood of a peace deal and a two-state solution : " it 's not only that it is very hard for a right-wing government to freeze the settlements , " she said , " it also seems to be very hard for the palestinian side to get into a unity government . "
to yaron , however , the israeli prime minister has more political leeway than it may seem at first sight : " netanyahu has potentially enough coalition partners for his own likud party to continue to govern , " yaron said .
" there is the option of kadima , his major opposition partner . "
kadima , which is led by tzipi livni , refused to enter netanyahu 's coalition , because they were not convinced that he was going to press ahead with a diplomatic solution to the palestinian problem .
" should they become convinced that he is willing to remove settlements , " yaron said , " that he is willing to reach an agreement with the palestinians , they would have no choice but to enter his government .
together with the labour party , the three parties together are large enough to hold a coalition . "
but yaron warns that this would solve only half of the problem : " there is a palestinian partner on the other side , that is completely divided into two entities .
we have the hamas state in the gaza strip and the fatah state in the west bank .
there is no unity on the horizon on the palestinian side .
whatever president mahmoud abbas says does not seem to be binding for hamas . "
different time tables the palestinian divide suits the settlers .
" the settler movement has a history of trying to play for time , " yaron said .
" they think that time is on their side .
with every day that passes they are able to extend their settlements and to create facts on the ground , that will make it even more difficult to create a palestinian state . "
silke tempel said she 's concerned about that kind of scenario . " i think in the long run the settlements might threaten the very existence of israel , because they might hinder the possibility that israel can withdraw from palestinian territory , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the obama administration is trying to deliver new impetus to a middle east peace deal yaron is convinced that the " pragmatic israeli majority " is aware of the fact that " time seems not to be in their favor . "
but , they do have a different time frame than the west , he added .
" the west wants to solve the palestinian problem first and then look at the middle east as a whole .
the israelis say : before we solve the iranian problem , we can not solve anything else , because the iranians are the ones that are pulling the strings behind terror organisations like hezbollah and hamas . "
in the meantime us president barack obama is attempting a more diplomatic approach towards iran than his predecessor george w. bush .
for the time being , the israeli government is willing to wait and see .
" my personal guess , " gil yaron said , " is the israelis will wait until the middle of 2010 and then they are going to press for action .
whether that will be diplomatic , in terms of much harsher sanctions , or military , that remains to be seen . "

ahead of their meeting , merkel appealed to israel to show flexibility in efforts to achieve peace in the middle east .
she told the n24 broadcaster that " we should n't let the window of opportunity close . "
a spokesman in berlin reaffirmed the german government 's stance that further israeli settlements should be stopped .
netanyahu arrived in berlin after meeting with british prime minister gordon brown and us middle east envoy george mitchell in london .
mitchell and netanyahu left their four-hour meeting in london tight-lipped .
while a joint statement released after the talks said that they had " made good progress " on laying the groundwork for resuming peace talks between israeli and the palestinians , there was no indication that either side had given in on the divisive settlements issue .
the men did agree , however , that further talks between mitchell and israeli officials should take place next week in the us .

he said jahangir , who was the sole occupant of the vehicle , was killed and his car was badly damaged in the explosion . taliban spokesman zabiullah mujahid , speaking by phone from an undisclosed location , claimed that his fighters were behind the blast .
he claimed the bomb , which was remotely detonated , killed three more officials in the vehicle . taliban-led attacks are on the rise in the northern region , which was relatively peaceful until recently except for sporadic attacks , mostly roadside bombs . meanwhile , the interior ministry said wednesday 's deadly blast in kandahar province killed 43 people and wounded 65 . death toll rises after truck bomb in kandahar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kandahar bomb hit those ending their ramadan fast gholam ali wahdat , the police commander for the southern region , said earlier that 40 were killed and more than 64 other people , mostly civilians were wounded in the blast , when a truck bomb exploded in the centre of the city as people were breaking their ramadan fast .
" it was a truck bomb .
in total 40 to 41 people have been killed and over 65 other people have been wounded , " he said .
officials in the province had earlier said that they believed the explosion was caused by several explosive-laden vehicles that went off simultaneously . zelmai ayoubi , spokesman for the provincial governor of kandahar gave a different death toll , saying the blast killed 38 people , mostly civilians , and including four pakistani workers , who were employed by a japanese construction company . the area , which is located near government offices , remained sealed off to traffic as police rescue teams were still searching for civilians trapped under rubble . the blast destroyed dozens of houses , set alight a wedding hall and broke windows as far as one kilometer away . there was no immediate claim of responsibility but an interior ministry spokesman blamed the attack on taliban-linked insurgents , who have struck repeatedly during campaigning for last week 's vote .
the blast occurred as kandahar residents had gathered at homes and restaurants to break their day-long fast . afghanistan , where around 99 per cent of the population is muslim , observes the holy month of ramadan from dawn to dusk .
president hamid karzai condemned the attack in a statement issued by his office on wednesday .
it said the president held an emergency meeting with his security chiefs in kabul and ordered them to gather information about the incident . commission offers partial results from presidential poll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iec results show karzai slightly ahead of his rival the blast occurred around one hour after the afghan independent election commission announced partial results of country 's presidential election , which the radical islamist taliban had urged voters to boycott . a partial vote count showed karzai narrowly leading his former foreign minister , abdullah abdullah , by 40.6 per cent to 38.7 per cent , the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- said .
out of the half-million ballots initially counted , the western-backed karzai had 212,927 votes or 40.6 percent , and former foreign minister abdullah was on 202,889 votes or 38.6 percent , according to the iec .
karzai 's camp earlier insisted it had triumphed in last thursday 's election , a pivotal moment in afghanistan 's troubled emergence from years of civil war and taliban rule as western troops battle to defeat a raging insurgency .
but daud najafi , the iec 's chief electoral officer , stressed that it was too early to tell with final results not due until september 3 .
" i repeat again , these are partial results of about 10 percent of the overall vote , " he told a news conference .
" i repeat again , this will definitely change tomorrow , the day after tomorrow .
this is only partial results , " the official said .
the commission has said it expects to release the final results around september 17 , but should the trend seen on tuesday continue , a run-off between karzai and abdullah would be necessary .
suspicions of vote-fixing heighten tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah suspects foul play but tones down his rhetoric the neck-and-neck race between the two increasingly bitter rivals has been tainted with claims of fraud and ballot-stuffing , most of it in favor of karzai , whose camp has been claiming victory since shortly after polls closed .
figures released by karzai 's campaign office , gathered from polling stations by his representatives , show him winning with between 55 and 62 percent of the vote .
the karzai office figures show total turnout at less than 5.5 million , of registered voters numbering between 15 million and 17 million .
analysts have said that such low turnout could raise questions about the legitimacy of the victor , possibly threatening to spark widespread unrest .
the results of afghanistan 's elections could deepen the divides that plague the shaky nation .
abdullah has his powerbase in the north , among ethnic tajiks , while karzai is influential in the pashtun-dominated south .
abdullah , the urbane former minister whose energetic campaign stymied karzai 's hopes of an easy re-election , again accused the president of rampant vote fraud but damped down fears of violence linked to a disputed outcome .
" i 'm urging the afghans to be calm and to be patient and to show responsibility , " he told reporters at his home in kabul .
" i think that the people do n't want to resort to violence , " he said .
" all our efforts were in order to bring stability to this country , and to bring greater governance and greater rule of law . " nda / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last friday gm rejected a proposal to sell a controlling 55 percent stake in opel to magna and the russian state-owned lender sberbank .
the company 's board was reportedly unhappy with strings berlin attached to state funding required to close the deal .
bild reported that berlin may accept the rhj bid if the fund teams up with an international partner from the car industry . the shift in the government 's position followed talks in berlin on tuesday between gm negotiator john smith and jochen homann , who heads the german government 's " opel task force . "
berlin has also acknowledged that it may not be possible to close a deal on opel until after the national election on september 27 .
" if it happens before then , that 's good , but it has to be substantial , " german economy minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

shortly before gm declared bankruptcy in the us in june , it transferred control of opel to a government-backed trust , which owns 65 percent of the company while gm holds the remainder .
the german government has offered up to 4.5 billion euros worth of federal and state loan guarantees to magna , which hoped to buy a 55 percent stake in opel with the help of russia 's sberbank .
merkel and her advisors have favored magna because they believe the company 's plans will involve fewer job cuts from opel 's 50,000 workers , about half of whom are in germany .
rhj 's plans for opel include a substantial downsizing of the auto company - something the german government had hoped to avoid in the lead-up to an election .
now that general motors has exited bankruptcy proceedings in the us , the company has signaled that it hopes to hold onto opel or at least retain the option of repurchasing the company within a few years so it can maintain control over opel 's technology and small car platforms , which it plans to use in the us market .

the announcement follows an agreement by french banks to implement limits . nicolas sarkozy has been one of the loudest critics of the banking industry and he has now promised to fight for stronger commitments on controls at the next g20 meeting .
" i will not be sparing in my efforts to come up with a european approach on this subject , " sarkozy said .

there has been international concern in recent months that bank bonuses have been slowly rising to levels that were equal to those before the global financial meltdown .

sarkozy said that banks would be required to defer two-thirds of bonuses paid to traders over a three-year period and that a third of the payout had to be in bank stocks .
bankers could also face penalties if they lose money for their companies .
the outrage over the bonuses has been inflamed by concerns that banks are not extending credit to small companies in spite of the large amount of public money that has been put into the financial sector .
" we will not work with banks who do not apply these rules , " sarkozy told reporters after his seventh banking summit since the crisis began .
" i want banks who do not play by the rules to be punished , " he added .
the new rules were confirmed by the head of the french banking federation who said that its members had agreed to the new restrictions .

the result means stuttgart join bundesliga champions wolfsburg and bayern munich in this season 's champions league group stage .
the most tense second leg of the playoffs , however , was played out in florence , where fiorentina edged out sporting lisbon on the away-goals rule .
fiorentina battled to a 1-1 draw , courtesy of a vital goal from19-year-old montenegro striker stevan jovetic and go through 3-3 on aggregate , after they drew 2-2 in lisbon last tuesday .
" this is the most important goal of my career so far , " said jovetic .
joao moutinho had put sporting ahead in the stadio artemio franchi in the 35th minute with an elegant free-kick .
but fiorentina came out for the second half with a sense of purpose and determination , and the vital equalizer came nine minutes after the interval .
jovetic got the ball outside the penalty area , calmly cut inside and made it 1-1 with a precise near-post drive .
sporting pushed forward desperately late in the match but failed to get the goal they needed .
" this was a very tense tie , and we would have gone through if we had been a little sharper in both penalty areas , " said paulo bento , sporting 's coach .
sporting now go into the new europa league , together with fc copenhagen , who lost 3-1 in to nicosia , going out 3-2 on aggregate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 26.08.2009 vaccination timetable unclear as swine flu spreads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not enough shots for everybody - health ministers are planning to order enough doses for a third of the population failing to reach agreement over funding the german government 's plan to launch mass vaccinations remains riddled with uncertainties .
experts point to the new drugs ' unknown side effects as another problem . the number of swine flu cases in germany has risen by several hundred since the beginning of the week and now stands at close to 15,000 the robert-koch institute reported on wednesday .
the institution officially in charge of recording the outbreak in germany added that most new infections were caught by people travelling abroad .
faced with the growing extent of the swine flu outbreak in germany , the federal government last week decided to launch the largest mass immunization program in the nation 's history .
vaccinations are expected to start in october when sufficient serum is available , a health ministry spokeswoman said .
federal and state governments are aiming at obtaining a total of 50 million doses from drug company glaxosmithkline .
since every person has to be vaccinated twice , this would be sufficient for 25 million people .
del ays due to unclear funding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and senior citizens are particularly at risk but , state health ministers , who have failed to reach agreement on how to pay for it , have not yet been able to place necessary additional orders , as planned .
public health funds will foot half the bill estimated at about one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , but states and the federal government have not decided on how to split the remainder between them .
as a result , vaccinations for all but the most vulnerable groups , such as children and pensioners , will only start in late fall .
health ministers are planning to hold a special meeting in berlin in two weeks before placing the additional orders stalled so far . side effects feared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health minister ulla schmidt admits there may be side effects experts are concerned about yet another problem due to the massive extent of the operation and the short time available for drug companies to develop and test substances against swine flu .
" we may have to reckon with a larger number of previously unknown side effects " , warned the germany association of pediatricians -lrb- bkjv -rrb- .
a federal medical institute also pointed out that side effects like headaches or swellings may be more likely with vaccines against swine flu compared to those against seasonal flu viruses .
the health ministry does not deny this and minister ulla schmidt last week said she would not recommend vaccinating children until all medical studies have been completed .
another risk lies in the different methods of developing substances in europe and the us , wolfgang becker-brüser told the german newspaper " muenchner merkur " .
the munich-based medical journal editor said that us labs use common flu vaccines and adapt them to deal with the new virus .
" this method is safer compared to what the europeans and germany are doing " , he added .
the latter 's substances are based on the much less tested vaccine against bird flu .

seventy years after the invasion of poland , this documentary was developed by filmmakers from both countries to shed light on this dark chapter in german-polish history and relay the events from different perspectives .
the premiere event was attended by the polish ambassador to germany , marek prawda , and other prominent guests from politics , culture and the media .
christoph lanz , director of television at deutsche welle , and agnieszka romaszewska-guzy from tvp-polonia , officially presented the german-polish co-production .
“ we are very pleased to have had the opportunity to work with tvp polonia and produce this documentary , ” said lanz .
“ after 70 years , it was definitely time for us to form this journalistic link .
i am glad that the collaboration with our polish colleagues went so well . ” “ 70 years after the outbreak of the war that led to one of the greatest tragedies in our country ’ s history , we must once again examine this period – but by way of facts and knowledge rather than prejudices and myths , ” stated romaszewska-guzy , who also stressed that polish and germans should take a shared approach in considering the war ’ s terrible events .
she added that this period of history should not be allowed to fade from memory .
“ we must be in a position to understand the war ’ s consequences and thanks to our friends at deutsche welle , this has proven to be possible . ”
the documentary shows that even before germany opened fire on the westerplatte with its schleswig-holstein ship – an event which is commonly viewed as the official beginning of the war – a series of german air force bombings had already laid the polish town of wielun in ruin .
the directors – peter bardehle and nadine klemens from germany , and michal nekanda-trepka and jan strekowski from poland – use the film to put individuals in the foreground .
the bombing of wielun forms the dramatic frame of the film , which is then narrated by both german soldiers and polish civilians .
seventy years after the war ’ s beginning , these individuals share their personal recollections . “ today ’ s german-polish relationship is practically a miracle ” renowned historians discuss the personal accounts and events of august and september 1939 through the lens of global politics : the director of the german-polish institute in darmstadt , dr. dieter bingen , and the historian norman davies , who lives in oxford and warsaw .
davies wrote the well-known study , “ europe at war 1939-1945 : no simple victory ” and focuses in particular on eastern european perceptions of world war two , together with the former kgb agent viktor suworow , who has researched the hitler-stalin pact for many years .
“ even in 2009 , we must stress what really happened for the sake of german-polish discourse , ” says bingen .
in light of how the nazis handled poland , it is practically a miracle that germany and poland “ have a relatively friendly relationship today , ” according to bingen . broadcast times dw-tv will broadcast the two-part documentary worldwide in german , english , spanish and arabic .
the 26-minute segments will be broadcast in english on tuesday , september 1 and tuesday , september 8 at 19:00 utc .
dw-tv is available in europe via hotbird 8 und astra 1l as well as a live stream on the internet -lrb- www.dw-world.de -rrb- .

the additional bail-out funds would come from the government 's financial market stabilization fund , soffin , which has been set up to provide liquidity for banks struggling with the financial crisis .
" developments over the last months made clear that they will , of course , need extra capital , " finance minister peer steinbrueck said .

the government plans on completing its takeover in october with ' squeeze out ' maneuver that will force the remaining shareholders to sell their stakes for 1.30 euro per share .
" that price is anything but fair , " said ulrich hocker , chief of germany 's dsw private investors ' association , which plans to challenge the forced sale in court .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- should gps be more open on pay ?
bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes 04:59 gmt , wednesday , 26 august 2009 05:59 uk should gps be more open on pay ?
viewpoint dr michael dixon nhs alliance chairman gp pay levels are controversial , with the average family doctor earning over £ 100,000 and claims some earn well in excess of that .
in this week 's scrubbing up , dr michael dixon argues gps must stop simply disputing such figures and be more open about their salaries . "
mud sticks .
when the daily mail claims that gps earn " jaw dropping " amounts of money - some well over £ 300,000 - is it enough to simply dispute this ?
should we be more transparent about what we do actually earn ?
the issue is not simply about how gps want to be perceived . "
transparency may prove to be the only answer " send us your comments we are hardly in the same league as bankers and no-one is suggesting , as in the case of one or two mps , that we might have broken any rules .
my own pay from the nhs before tax is just under £ 100,000 pro rata , including a seniority allowance .
the problem is that , if gps are seen as " fat cats " , earning more than we deserve , this could seriously damage our relationship with patients , who may perceive us to be there just for the money .
this , of course , would have a negative impact on our ability to create a rapport with our patients which is essential if we are to fulfil our role as doctors , including being empathetic and able to comfort our patients .
transparency may prove to be the only answer .
gps , as advocates of patients and their local population , need to take the high moral ground .
to offer transparency before it is demanded of them may become a serious option for them and all those working in the public services .
' taxpayers are our paymasters ' gps do n't need to be defensive .
the overall cost of their general practitioner and practice for each patient is just £ 120 per year , or £ 10 a month , which represents value for money , considering that patients have unlimited access not only to their gp but also to other services the practice may provide .
is simply saying all this enough to convince the public and our patients that doctors are not overpaid ?
it may be reasonable for the public to ask to see the actual figures .
after all , as taxpayers , they are paymasters .
they will point to assertions that the increase in money going into general practice since the new gp contract has only partially gone into paying for more staff and equipment .
some practices have used the new income to improve the service , some have used it to significantly increase take home pay .
others are deservedly earning more money because they are working harder and longer and running more cost-effective practices .
should the public and their patients not be allowed to judge these things just as we have been allowed to judge mps on their salaries and expenses ?

viewpoint dr michael dixon nhs alliance chairman gps receive payments for care including childhood jabs gp pay levels are controversial , with the average family doctor earning over £ 100,000 and claims some earn well in excess of that .
in this week 's scrubbing up , dr michael dixon argues gps must stop simply disputing such figures and be more open about their salaries .
mud sticks .
when the daily mail claims that gps earn " jaw dropping " amounts of money - some well over £ 300,000 - is it enough to simply dispute this ?
should we be more transparent about what we do actually earn ?
the issue is not simply about how gps want to be perceived .
transparency may prove to be the only answer send us your comments we are hardly in the same league as bankers and no-one is suggesting , as in the case of one or two mps , that we might have broken any rules .
my own pay from the nhs before tax is just under £ 100,000 pro rata , including a seniority allowance .
the problem is that , if gps are seen as " fat cats " , earning more than we deserve , this could seriously damage our relationship with patients , who may perceive us to be there just for the money .
this , of course , would have a negative impact on our ability to create a rapport with our patients which is essential if we are to fulfil our role as doctors , including being empathetic and able to comfort our patients .
transparency may prove to be the only answer .
gps , as advocates of patients and their local population , need to take the high moral ground .
to offer transparency before it is demanded of them may become a serious option for them and all those working in the public services .
' taxpayers are our paymasters ' gps do n't need to be defensive .
the overall cost of their general practitioner and practice for each patient is just £ 120 per year , or £ 10 a month , which represents value for money , considering that patients have unlimited access not only to their gp but also to other services the practice may provide .
is simply saying all this enough to convince the public and our patients that doctors are not overpaid ?
it may be reasonable for the public to ask to see the actual figures .
after all , as taxpayers , they are paymasters .
they will point to assertions that the increase in money going into general practice since the new gp contract has only partially gone into paying for more staff and equipment .
some practices have used the new income to improve the service , some have used it to significantly increase take home pay .
others are deservedly earning more money because they are working harder and longer and running more cost-effective practices .
should the public and their patients not be allowed to judge these things just as we have been allowed to judge mps on their salaries and expenses ?

the overall cost of their general practitioner and practice for each patient is just £ 120 per year , or £ 10 a month , which represents value for money , considering that patients have unlimited access not only to their gp but also to other services the practice may provide .
is simply saying all this enough to convince the public and our patients that doctors are not overpaid ?
it may be reasonable for the public to ask to see the actual figures .
after all , as taxpayers , they are paymasters .
they will point to assertions that the increase in money going into general practice since the new gp contract has only partially gone into paying for more staff and equipment .
some practices have used the new income to improve the service , some have used it to significantly increase take home pay .
others are deservedly earning more money because they are working harder and longer and running more cost-effective practices .
should the public and their patients not be allowed to judge these things just as we have been allowed to judge mps on their salaries and expenses ?
only fair this is an issue that is bound to divide the gp profession .
plenty will argue that their take home pay is their own business , as it is for most people .
a few will say that , if the public have a grossly distorted view of what gps earn , then the only way to put the record straight will be for gps and practices to open their accounts to their patients and the public .
gps and their practices have a key role to play in their local community alternatively , it might be possible to devise an index , which would enable public and patients to know if a gp practice is ploughing back sufficient money in to practice and patient services .
clearly , the issue here is not only about how much gps earn , but what services they are providing in return for their salaries .
it would n't be fair to only compare gps ' income without considering how many patients they have , the services they provide and even the specific health issues they are having to tackle in their local communities .
whatever road we decide to take , i would like to think that gps , their patients , the public and the media will really consider our work as more than just a number crunching exercise .
gps and their practices have a key role to play in their local community which is independent of how many patients they have and how much money they earn .

viewpoint dr michael dixon nhs alliance chairman gps receive payments for care including childhood jabs gp pay levels are controversial , with the average family doctor earning over £ 100,000 and claims some earn well in excess of that .
in this week 's scrubbing up , dr michael dixon argues gps must stop simply disputing such figures and be more open about their salaries .
mud sticks .
when the daily mail claims that gps earn " jaw dropping " amounts of money - some well over £ 300,000 - is it enough to simply dispute this ?
should we be more transparent about what we do actually earn ?
the issue is not simply about how gps want to be perceived .
transparency may prove to be the only answer send us your comments we are hardly in the same league as bankers and no-one is suggesting , as in the case of one or two mps , that we might have broken any rules .
my own pay from the nhs before tax is just under £ 100,000 pro rata , including a seniority allowance .
the problem is that , if gps are seen as " fat cats " , earning more than we deserve , this could seriously damage our relationship with patients , who may perceive us to be there just for the money .
this , of course , would have a negative impact on our ability to create a rapport with our patients which is essential if we are to fulfil our role as doctors , including being empathetic and able to comfort our patients .

the charity said there were 124 cases last year , a reduction of four on 2007 , but many more incidents are believed to be undetected and unreported .
crimes included shooting , poisoning , trapping and the theft of birds and their eggs .
denbighshire was the county with the worst record - 24 reported incidents .
gwynedd followed with 18 incidents , while there were eight in anglesey .
the rspb 's investigations unit said of the 124 reported cases in wales 35 were against birds of prey , with buzzards being the most common victims .
wildlife crime it added that welsh incidents accounted for around 11 % of the uk total , and it was using its birdcrime 2008 report to repeat its call for a review of the way these crimes are policed .
in wales , police forces benefit from the support of two dedicated wildlife crime officers seconded to the countryside council for wales .
the charity 's head of investigations ian west said : " the rspb welcomes the two centres of excellence in wales .
however , we believe a review is still needed in order to measure the overall standard of the service in wales . "
director of rspb cymru dr tim stowe said it would do all it could to continue to support wales ' dedicated wildlife crime officers .
he added : " however , the public 's help is also vital in helping us put a stop to these crimes and hold those responsible to account . "
sgt rob taylor , a wildlife and environmental crime officer , said : " there have been a number of high profile cases in north wales in the past months and a number of investigations are still ongoing . "
