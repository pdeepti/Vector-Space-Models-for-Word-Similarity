but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 us seeks to enhance cooperation with european allies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden 's speech was highly anticipated by the 350 political leaders meeting in munich in the us administration 's first major foreign policy speech since taking office , vice-president joe biden promised greater cooperation with europe .
but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .

benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .

his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation .

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry .

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .

" michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need .

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- ... but all that will take time , " williamson was quoted as saying by magazine on saturday , feb .
7 .
" i ask everyone to believe me that i did not deliberately say something false .
i was , on the basis of my research in the 1980s , convinced of the accuracy of my comments .
now i must examine everything again and look at the evidence , " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict called on williamson to retract statements he made about the holocaust the pope had demanded williamson unequivocally distance himself statements he made in an interview with swedish television in which he said only up to 300,000 jews were murdered in nazi concentration camps .
historians put the figure at 6 million . williamson has apologized to the pope " for the unnecessary distress " he has caused him but has not apologized to jews .
the vatican has said benedict was not aware of the statements williamson made two days before the excommunication was lifted . italian priest also denies extent of holocaust the ultra-traditionalist roman catholic group society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , of which williamson is a member , has expelled an italian priest who said he believed gas chambers at nazi death camps were only used to " disinfect " inmates . sspx 's italian branch said father floriano abrahamowicz was expelled for " serious disciplinary reasons , " the ansa news agency reported citing a sspx statement issued friday . abrahamowicz made the remarks while defending williamson . inter-faith dialogue to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has expressed his solidarity with jews since lifting the excommunications israel 's chief rabbinate is resuming dialogue with the vatican after ties were put on ice following the pope 's decision to lift the excommunication of williamson and three other priests of the ultra-traditionalist society of st pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , reuters news agency reported saturday . the rabbinate pulled out of a meeting with vatican officials scheduled for the beginning of march amid an international outcry over the bishops ' rehabilitation .
the meeting will now take place in late february or mid-march and will most likely include a papal audience . benedict is also scheduled to meet with the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations -lrb- cpmajo -rrb- on thursday to make amends , retuers reported .
both the meetings , however , were planned before williamson 's statement to der spiegel . the head of the german bishops council , archbishop robert zollitsch , renewed his call for williamson to be , once again , excommunicated from the catholic church , calling the british-born williamson " irresponsible .

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need .

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 07.02.2009 holocaust denial row damages church , vatican expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row has caused some to formally withdraw from the catholic church the catholic church sees the faithful leaving the church in droves after the controversial lifting of the excommunication of a group of rightist bishops , a german vatican expert said saturday . father eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german service , said in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper that a new " wave of exits " had already set in after pope benedict xvi lifted the excommunication of four leaders of the st. pius x society , one of whom denies the holocaust .
in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if i find proof i would rectify -lrb- earlier statements -rrb- ... but all that will take time , " williamson was quoted as saying by magazine on saturday , feb .
7 .
" i ask everyone to believe me that i did not deliberately say something false .
i was , on the basis of my research in the 1980s , convinced of the accuracy of my comments .
now i must examine everything again and look at the evidence , " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict called on williamson to retract statements he made about the holocaust the pope had demanded williamson unequivocally distance himself statements he made in an interview with swedish television in which he said only up to 300,000 jews were murdered in nazi concentration camps .
historians put the figure at 6 million . williamson has apologized to the pope " for the unnecessary distress " he has caused him but has not apologized to jews .
the vatican has said benedict was not aware of the statements williamson made two days before the excommunication was lifted . italian priest also denies extent of holocaust the ultra-traditionalist roman catholic group society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , of which williamson is a member , has expelled an italian priest who said he believed gas chambers at nazi death camps were only used to " disinfect " inmates . sspx 's italian branch said father floriano abrahamowicz was expelled for " serious disciplinary reasons , " the ansa news agency reported citing a sspx statement issued friday . abrahamowicz made the remarks while defending williamson . inter-faith dialogue to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope has expressed his solidarity with jews since lifting the excommunications israel 's chief rabbinate is resuming dialogue with the vatican after ties were put on ice following the pope 's decision to lift the excommunication of williamson and three other priests of the ultra-traditionalist society of st pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- , reuters news agency reported saturday . the rabbinate pulled out of a meeting with vatican officials scheduled for the beginning of march amid an international outcry over the bishops ' rehabilitation .
the meeting will now take place in late february or mid-march and will most likely include a papal audience . benedict is also scheduled to meet with the conference of presidents of major american jewish organizations -lrb- cpmajo -rrb- on thursday to make amends , retuers reported .
both the meetings , however , were planned before williamson 's statement to der spiegel . the head of the german bishops council , archbishop robert zollitsch , renewed his call for williamson to be , once again , excommunicated from the catholic church , calling the british-born williamson " irresponsible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .
peter ramsauer , the tough-talking head of the csu parliamentary party in berlin , was seen as the most likely successor . in line with tradition , the parties in the ruling coalition propose replacements for their own members who leave the cabinet . the csu lost its absolute majority in bavarian state elections last february and was forced to seek a coalition with the free-market liberal free democratic party . glos has been economics minister since merkel 's conservatives took office in a grand coalition with the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in 2005 .
he joined the csu in 1970 and was elected to parliament six years later . his decision to quit comes at a time when germany is facing its deepest recession in decades , with growth slumping , unemployment rising and banks reluctant to provide credit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 . the minister is a member of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the 64-year-old glos expressed his desire to step down in a letter to csu leader host seehofer , who is also president of the southern german state of bavaria . bild am sonntag , which said it had obtained a copy of the letter , said glos told seehofer he wanted to quit in order to make way for a renewal in the csu .
the letter reportedly said that the csu needed " renewal , creative power and credibility more than ever . " glos told seehofer that after the general election on sept .
27 he no longer wanted to remain in the government and asked to be relieved of his cabinet duties as soon as possible , bild am sonntag said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer said he wanted talk to glos ' about the reasons the resignation offer seehofer , however , refused glos ' resignation on saturday . " michael glos has my complete trust , " seehofer said according to his spokesperson .
" i have informed michael glos that i will not comply with his request . " anonymous sources told the german dpa news agency it was likely seehofer would name a replacement quickly .

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 07.02.2009 analysis : europe optimistic after biden foreign policy speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biden said the us would do more internationally and demand more of its allies the us policy of taking world events into its own hands was officially buried by us vice president joe biden 's speech at the munich security conference .
the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...
i hope that will continue and be expanded to the financial crisis and climate change , " he said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also said there would be some strings attached . us vice-president joe biden on saturday , feb .
7 , promised greater cooperation with european allies on security issues , but only in exchange for greater european contributions to fighting global security threats . biden 's speech before the munich security conference , billed as the new us administration 's first glimpse of an overarching security and defense policy , presented a laundry list of us priorities around the world , combined with a promise of greater us humility in addressing those issues . " i come to europe on behalf of the new administration ... determined to set a new tone not just in washington , but in america 's relations around the world , " biden said .
" america will do more .
that 's the good news .
the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " eying afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european capitals are wary about increased military engagement in afghanistan european politicians warily waited to hear details of the new us administration 's plans for afghanistan , where many are reluctant to contribute more troops to a nato-led mission . but nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer told europeans that the balance within the world 's largest military alliance was being upset . " i am frankly concerned when i hear the united states is planning a major commitment for afghanistan , but other allies ruling out doing more , " he said . us president barack obama has said afghanistan would become the main front in the " war on terrorism " and that he plans to deploy 30,000 more us troops there over the next 18 months . a break from bush bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will tighten international ties , biden said in other issues of foreign policy , biden said the united states would listen to , engage and consult with other countries and international organizations of the world adding , " america needs the world just as , i believe , the world needs america . " he also hinted that washington will still retain the right to strike out on its own when circumstances warrant .
" we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he said . the brunt of biden 's speech focused on the desire for obama 's administration to back away from some of the more confrontational aspects of bush 's foreign policy .
in exchange for the anticipated european cooperation , he vowed that america will no longer torture prisoners and reaffirmed us commitment to closing the prison at guantanamo bay in cuba , while also calling on european countries to be prepared to take in some of the released inmates . he vowed that the united states would stay in close contact with russia on the topic of missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , a policy pursued by former president george w. bush that was met with saber-rattling by russia . merkel : iran a litmus test bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : confronting iran 's nucelar ambitions will test the world , merkel said a day after the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , expressed skepticism about obama 's promise to engage in diplomacy with iran , biden left no doubt that the us administration is willing to engage in talks with iran about its suspected nuclear weapons program .
" we will extend hand to those who unclench their fist , " he said , repeating an oft-used line from the new us administration .
" we will be willing to talk .
we will be willing to talk to iran and offer a clear choice .
continue down the current course and there will be continued pressure and isolation . " german chancellor angela merkel called dealing with iran a " litmus test " for the international community .
she also said berlin would support stricter sanctions against tehran in order to prevent the islamic republic from obtaining nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new trans-atlantic partnership , however , will have its price . it remains to be seen whether the united states will follow through on its promises to consult with its allies and talk with its enemies - and how european leaders will cope with a world where they are expected to provide not just counsel , but also the manpower to turn their policy proposals into reality . " america will do more .
that 's the good news , " said biden , to the delight of most of the european leaders present at the annual conference .
" the bad news is that america will ask for more from our partners as well . " that could mean expectations that european countries will take in guantanamo detainees released if us president barrack obama closes the facility as promised .
it could mean calls for more european troops in un-mandated operations in afghanistan . it will also certainly mean us expectations of european support for yet more sanctions on iran should that nation not open up its nuclear program to weapons inspectors . european anxieties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans look back fondly on days when the us did n't consult them ?
any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .

any one of those issues by itself could prove a tough nut for european politicians to crack . should the united states call on its european allies for help in all of these issues - let alone for unknown threats lurking on the world stage - some leaders might soon find a touch of nostalgia for the days when they were neither consulted , nor expected to contribute . but first reactions were positive .
german chancellor angela merkel welcomed the new us readiness to " work together , not only on analyzing challenges , but also in meeting decisions on implementation . " javier solana , the european union 's high representative for foreign aid and security policy , was likewise optimistic .
" i do n't think it 's bad news , " he said .
" we have to put our contributions forward .
we can not be players and not put anything in the basket . " talking to iran , russia nonetheless , the newfound us openness may not prove popular in all corners .
biden made a point to reiterate the president 's pledge to extend an open hand to any nation that unclenched a fist , a by now familiar reference to iran . but on friday , the speaker of iran 's parliament , ali larijani , said that iran would only consider the new us approach if washington was prepared to acknowledge past wrongs against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us will re-evaluate the missile defense shield planned for eastern europe , biden said similarly , biden 's promise of more openness with russia regarding proposed missile defense facilities in poland and the czech republic - a move that had been anticipated given the democrats ' skepticism toward missile defense - was pre-empted by comments from russian deputy prime minister sergei ivanov on friday night . ivanov made it clear that the only acceptable solution was a world without those systems in eastern europe . unilateral option open nor did biden 's speech rule out the possibility of us unilateralism in times of need . " we 'll work in a partnership whenever we can , " he noted . that , in itself , is not a problem , said karsten voigt , coordinator for german-american cooperation with the german foreign ministry . " that 's the difference between a world power and a country like germany , " voigt told deutsche presse-agentur dpa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voigt said give and take will return to the eu-us relationship countries with limited military power , like germany , must rely on multilateral organizations to achieve their ends .
a defense giant like the united states will always keep the unilateral option in its back pocket , he said . voigt instead focused on the positive . " it was a speech that showed that europe and america will confront the global and regional problems together , " he said .
" that we have a level of balance .
that there is now a give and take . " the main problem he sees is that so many of the major issues facing the united states lie outside europe , whereas the partners from whom it seeks help are predominantly within europe .
that could mean that , even if european allies are willing to lend aid , practical considerations might limit their ability to do so . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the nato chief was critical of moscow , france 's sarkozy said russia posed no military threat . russian president dmitry medvedev 's call for a new treaty in europe " deserves to be taken seriously " and europe and the united states " should engage in this discussion , " eu foreign-policy chief javier solana told the prestigious munich security conference . but the secretary general of nato , jaap de hoop scheffer , whose organization will be crucial to any new security arrangement , ruled out such a discussion as long as russia plans to build military bases in the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . " i can not see how we can have such a discussion of the new architecture ... when russia is building bases inside georgia .
that can not be ignored , and it can not be the foundation of a new security architecture , " de hoop scheffer told some 350 top world politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scheffer said the russia-georgia conflict was a reason not to start security talks french president nicolas sarkozy said that medvedev 's proposal was worth considering .
" russia today does not constitute a military threat to the european union and nato , " he said , adding that moscow had " too many internal challenges " to contemplate military aggression . opposition to spheres of influence any deal would have to uphold the role of the us in european security and the freedom of european states to choose their allies , and ban the idea of " spheres of influence " in europe , solana said . the treaty should not give any country the right to stop another state joining nato , de hoop scheffer agreed . medvedev launched the call for an international treaty aimed at outlawing the use of force " from vancouver to vladivostok " last june .
his proposal came as tensions between moscow and washington were rising over plans by then-us president george w. bush to site elements of a us missile-defense system in central europe and to enlarge nato to bring in georgia and ukraine . medvedev 's call had received a mixed response in europe , which hardened in the wake of russia 's august war with georgia over the breakaway georgian regions of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia ready to reduce nuclear arms on the sidelines of the munich conference , russian foreign minister sergei lavrov on saturday said that russia was prepared to further reduce its nuclear missile arsenal and to engage in talks with the us on replacing the strategic arms reduction treaty , which expires at the end of the this year . the so-called start was a landmark cold war-era disarmament pact between the us and the then-soviet union and moscow has long sought talks on its replacement . while the previous us administration had been slow to address the issue , us secretary of state hillary clinton promised before her appointment to quickly begin negotiations on start . lack of trust between russia , west solana said that the key problem in the relationship between russia and the west was a lack of trust , which should be addressed by creating a " climate of cooperation . " " cooperation between the eu , the us and russia on some of most difficult issues has been very positive : iran , the middle east , non-proliferation , terrorism ...

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i ask everyone to believe me that i did not deliberately say something false .
i was , on the basis of my research in the 1980s , convinced of the accuracy of my comments .

in germany , austria and switzerland , catholics have the option of formally quitting the church by registering their exit with local authorities .
they are then no longer considered catholic .
" in other countries this is not possible , as baptism can not be revoked , " gemmingen said .
the relationship of trust between the german-born pope and german catholics has been " shaken , " gemmingen said , but believed benedict xvi 's planned visit to his home country next year could repair some of the damage .
pope 's israel visit uncertain " it hurts if you see that many people do not understand rome and the pope any longer , " the vatican expert said and also voiced scepticism whether the head of the catholic church would go ahead with his planned visit to israel this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict is to visit his native germany again next year " if it really happens is still very open , " he said , while indicating there had been no adverse signals from the jewish state .
benedict xvi , former cardinal joseph ratzinger , had lifted the excommunication of holocaust-denier richard williamson and three other bishops of the st. pius x society , a move which triggered criticism within the church and an outcry in his german homeland , including sharp remarks from chancellor angela merkel .
according to an opinion poll by state broadcaster ard , only 42 percent of germans approve of his work , down from 63 percent when ratzinger took office four years ago .
communication problems in rome amid growing pressure , a statement was eventually issued in which the vatican said that the british-born williamson would have to recant his holocaust-denial claims before being allowed to occupy any office within the church .
the st. pius x society broke with the vatican over church remors made in the 1960s .
gemmingen sharply criticized the vatican 's communication blunders during the affair .
" there is not only a communication problem .
but also an organization problem .
decisions can not not be made without involving those responsible for the issues in the vatican . "
there had to be better information , and decisions made jointly , he argued .
" but in the vatican communication will change only very slowly and very little . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
here the bbc 's team in washington tracks developments in the first 100 days of the obama presidency .
friday 6 february - day 18 1600 est obama 's new tone max deveson : president obama 's tone has changed on the stimulus package .
gone are the cocktail parties and appeals for bipartisan unity .
now , any delay for the stimulus bill is " inexcusable and irresponsible " , as mr obama said in his speech this morning .
and he made it pretty clear what he felt about republican attempts to amend the package .
" -lsb- the voters -rsb- did not send us to washington to get stuck in partisan posturing , or to turn back to the same tried and failed approaches that were rejected in the last election . "
will this new combative approach deliver the senate votes needed to pass the bill ?
if it does , then we might see it again during the coming legislative battles over healthcare and the economy .
thursday 5 february - day 17 1420 est who 's next for health ?
max deveson : with tom daschle out of the picture , washington is abuzz with speculation about who president obama will now pick as his health and human services secretary .
names in the frame include tennessee governor phil bredesen and former oregon governor john kitzhaber .
mr bredesen would ruffle feathers on the left -lrb- he cut his state 's health spending while in office -rrb- , while dr kitzhaber -lrb- before entering politics he was an emergency room physician -rrb- might be a bridge too far for the right of the party .
the compromise candidate might be kansas governor kathleen sebelius , who was an early obama backer in the election and has been hailed for her successful management of her state 's health system .
mind you - i lost a wager with a friend last summer that mr obama would pick ms sebelius as his running-mate , so perhaps my analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt ...
1350 est nascar cost-cutting kevin connolly : how fitting that president obama should start his day at the national prayer breakfast ; there at least he will have found hope and comfort - two commodities in short supply in the daily economic briefing he has now introduced .
it is not just the latest round of dire figures on unemployment and retail sales - wherever you look in the american economy , there are signs of strain .
i 'm at the international speedway on the florida coastline watching preparations for next week 's daytona 500 , traditional curtainraiser to the nascar motor-racing season .
-lrb- i 'll be reporting on it at length here in the coming days . -rrb-
even here the talk is of sponsors in dire straits -lrb- gm and ford are big players with big problems -rrb- , falling ad revenues and cost-cutting - the teams are reducing the number of practice laps to save money .
i do n't know if mr obama watches nascar in his scanty leisure time , but this year even the daytona 500 does n't offer much by way of escapism .
wednesday 4 february - day 16 1456 est will obama lift lid on guantanamo secrets ?
adam brookes : the obama administration is silent on whether it would allow uk courts to reveal details of guantanamo bay detainees ' experiences .
see the story of the brouhaha in the uk here binyam mohamed - a british resident now in guantanamo - says he was subject to " rendition " and torture .
the truth about his treatment lies in us intelligence documents .
a uk judge says he was pressured not to release the details of binyan mohamed 's treatment .
an interesting question here : the obama administration tells us guantanamo will close and it 's a new day in detention policy .
will the administration be prepared to lift the lid on what really happened to binyam mohamed and others like him ?
or do some secrets stay secret ? 1318 est populist pay caps kevin connolly : president obama has come up with a sure-fire populist gesture to change the subject after his recent run of bad headlines .
executives at companies bailed out by american taxpayers will be able to collect a maximum of $ 500,000 in salaries and bonuses until the money is paid back .
the president is quick to assert that america is still a society where they do n't begrudge wealth , but there 's been a backlash of popular anger against those celebrated fat cats of wall street who used $ 20bn of the first tranche of bailout funds to pay themselves bonuses after bringing the global economy to its knees .
no-one is quite suggesting that the financiers who hurled themselves from the upper storeys of manhattan skyscrapers during the wall street crash had the right idea , but america clearly feels that today 's titans of finance got it wrong .
watch the unfolding general motors saga to see where mr obama 's new rules take us - rick wagoner , the group ceo took home $ 14.5 million in 2007 .
if gm is bailed out next month , and the rules apply to detroit as well as wall street he 'll notice quite a difference in his pay packet .
tuesday 3 february - day 15 1350 est daschle out james coomarasamy : president obama has lost two of his nominees for top government positions over tax issues .
tom daschle has withdrawn from consideration as health and human services secretary - and nancy killefer will not be a candidate for the newly-created post of chief performance officer .
mr obama has been facing growing criticism over the contradiction between his pledge to create a new , ethical administration and the problems of his nominees .
both daschle and killefer said they did n't want to be a distraction from the president 's agenda .
my analysis of barack obama 's worst day in office so far 1230 est gregg pick official max deveson : barack obama has confirmed that he wants republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary .
but this will not mean the democrats get a filibuster-proof majority in the senate .
gregg reportedly only agreed to take the job on condition that he is replaced by a republican - and reports suggest that his former chief of staff bonnie newman is being lined up for the position .
meanwhile , it 's been revealed that back in 1995 he voted to abolish the department he is now set to lead .
0018 est ' buy american ' provisions risk backlash jonathan beale : is barack obama setting himself up for a new trade war ?
that question is being asked after democrats in the house and the senate made a " buy american " provision in the $ 800bn stimulus package .
it would require that the planned massive infrastructure projects use us-made materials .
to some big american companies and allies the " buy american " clause sounds like old fashioned protectionism .
after outcry from the eu , canada and the us chamber of commerce - all worried as to where this will lead - the white house now says it 's " reviewing the provision " .
but it leaves one wondering where an obama administration really stands on free trade .
remember barack obama on the campaign trail signalling that he could rip up bush 's nafta free trade agreements ?
at the time it was seen as a political gesture to win round the sceptical white working class vote .
mr obama wanted to reassure the unions that he was on their side .
perhaps that 's now become more important with the economic crises .
but if he allows the " buy american " clause to go through , he 'd better prepare for a backlash from the rest of the world .
monday 2 february - day 14 1540 est obama team gets the hollywood treatment rajini vaidyanathan : she 's more used to snapping a-list celebrities -lrb- one of her most famous pictures was of a naked , pregnant demi moore -rrb- , but now celebrity photographer annie leibovitz has turned her attention to the west wing .
in a series of pictures in this month 's vanity fair magazine , members of the obama administration have been given the leibovitz treatment .
the stylish shots include pictures of well-known members of the team like secretary of state hillary clinton and chief of staff rahm emanuel , as well as more junior staff like the white house social secretary , and the president 's speechwriter .
1150 est republican commerce secretary ?
max deveson : barack obama is set to nominate republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary , according to media reports .
i wrote about mr gregg last week , because he had been voting with the democrats on some crucial issues .
some liberal commentators have welcomed the prospect of mr gregg joining the cabinet - primarily because they are hoping that the man who would be charged with appointing his senate replacement - new hampshire governor john lynch , a democrat - will pick a fellow democrat .
one extra democrat -lrb- if , as expected , democrat al franken wins the disputed minnesota recount -rrb- , would give the party a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the senate .
it seems , however , that mr gregg is only going to take the job if mr lynch promises to replace him with a republican - or at least that 's what his party colleagues are hoping .
hillary and china kim ghattas : secretary of state hillary clinton will be lunching with treasury secretary timothy geithner .
the conversation will most likely focus on the world economic crisis and china in particular .
when mrs clinton spoke to journalists in her first news briefing last week , she said she was looking forward to working with her colleagues from other agencies , including mr geithner , to design " a more comprehensive approach that will be more in keeping with the important role that china is playing and will be playing " .
she took a subtle swipe at the bush administration saying the strategic dialogue between beijing and washington had become solely economic .
the world economic crisis means that finance , trade and foreign currency will be at the heart of diplomatic ties between countries around the world .
this gives mrs clinton another lever to make sure she is centre stage as well .
so as president obama 's team of rivals gets to work , the jockeying for position is starting .
friday 30 january - day 11 1945 est middle class empowerment rajini vaidyanathan : president obama has announced the creation of a " middle class task force " to raise living standards for , as the name suggests , middle-class us families .
it will be led by vice-president joe biden , who himself rose to the top from working class roots in scranton , pennsylvania .
the task force will host meetings with government agencies , business leaders , policy makers and community groups , to propose new policies and initiatives to help american families .
vice-president biden says the process will be totally transparent .
the accompanying website promises to post videos and minutes of meetings and allow people to submit their thoughts .
despite the promise of greater openness and engagement the task itself is a tough one .
will this task force be anything more than a talking shop , or will it be a fertilising ground for new policies ?
and even then , in uncertain economic times , can these new policies actually make a difference ? 1550 est obama and iran is president obama being " needlessly defensive and apologetic " in his overtures towards iran and the muslim world , as charles krauthammer argues ?
or is he in agreement with krauthammer 's basic position , but choosing to soften his rhetoric ?
the bbc 's north america editor justin webb offers his thoughts here .

now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
here the bbc 's team in washington tracks developments in the first 100 days of the obama presidency .
friday 6 february - day 18 1600 est obama 's new tone max deveson : president obama 's tone has changed on the stimulus package .
gone are the cocktail parties and appeals for bipartisan unity .
now , any delay for the stimulus bill is " inexcusable and irresponsible " , as mr obama said in his speech this morning .
and he made it pretty clear what he felt about republican attempts to amend the package .
" -lsb- the voters -rsb- did not send us to washington to get stuck in partisan posturing , or to turn back to the same tried and failed approaches that were rejected in the last election . "
will this new combative approach deliver the senate votes needed to pass the bill ?
if it does , then we might see it again during the coming legislative battles over healthcare and the economy .
thursday 5 february - day 17 1420 est who 's next for health ?
max deveson : with tom daschle out of the picture , washington is abuzz with speculation about who president obama will now pick as his health and human services secretary .
names in the frame include tennessee governor phil bredesen and former oregon governor john kitzhaber .
mr bredesen would ruffle feathers on the left -lrb- he cut his state 's health spending while in office -rrb- , while dr kitzhaber -lrb- before entering politics he was an emergency room physician -rrb- might be a bridge too far for the right of the party .
the compromise candidate might be kansas governor kathleen sebelius , who was an early obama backer in the election and has been hailed for her successful management of her state 's health system .
mind you - i lost a wager with a friend last summer that mr obama would pick ms sebelius as his running-mate , so perhaps my analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt ...
1350 est nascar cost-cutting kevin connolly : how fitting that president obama should start his day at the national prayer breakfast ; there at least he will have found hope and comfort - two commodities in short supply in the daily economic briefing he has now introduced .
it is not just the latest round of dire figures on unemployment and retail sales - wherever you look in the american economy , there are signs of strain .
i 'm at the international speedway on the florida coastline watching preparations for next week 's daytona 500 , traditional curtainraiser to the nascar motor-racing season .
-lrb- i 'll be reporting on it at length here in the coming days . -rrb-
even here the talk is of sponsors in dire straits -lrb- gm and ford are big players with big problems -rrb- , falling ad revenues and cost-cutting - the teams are reducing the number of practice laps to save money .
i do n't know if mr obama watches nascar in his scanty leisure time , but this year even the daytona 500 does n't offer much by way of escapism .
wednesday 4 february - day 16 1456 est will obama lift lid on guantanamo secrets ?
adam brookes : the obama administration is silent on whether it would allow uk courts to reveal details of guantanamo bay detainees ' experiences .
see the story of the brouhaha in the uk here binyam mohamed - a british resident now in guantanamo - says he was subject to " rendition " and torture .
the truth about his treatment lies in us intelligence documents .
a uk judge says he was pressured not to release the details of binyan mohamed 's treatment .
an interesting question here : the obama administration tells us guantanamo will close and it 's a new day in detention policy .
will the administration be prepared to lift the lid on what really happened to binyam mohamed and others like him ?
or do some secrets stay secret ? 1318 est populist pay caps kevin connolly : president obama has come up with a sure-fire populist gesture to change the subject after his recent run of bad headlines .
executives at companies bailed out by american taxpayers will be able to collect a maximum of $ 500,000 in salaries and bonuses until the money is paid back .
the president is quick to assert that america is still a society where they do n't begrudge wealth , but there 's been a backlash of popular anger against those celebrated fat cats of wall street who used $ 20bn of the first tranche of bailout funds to pay themselves bonuses after bringing the global economy to its knees .
no-one is quite suggesting that the financiers who hurled themselves from the upper storeys of manhattan skyscrapers during the wall street crash had the right idea , but america clearly feels that today 's titans of finance got it wrong .
watch the unfolding general motors saga to see where mr obama 's new rules take us - rick wagoner , the group ceo took home $ 14.5 million in 2007 .
if gm is bailed out next month , and the rules apply to detroit as well as wall street he 'll notice quite a difference in his pay packet .
tuesday 3 february - day 15 1350 est daschle out james coomarasamy : president obama has lost two of his nominees for top government positions over tax issues .
tom daschle has withdrawn from consideration as health and human services secretary - and nancy killefer will not be a candidate for the newly-created post of chief performance officer .
mr obama has been facing growing criticism over the contradiction between his pledge to create a new , ethical administration and the problems of his nominees .
both daschle and killefer said they did n't want to be a distraction from the president 's agenda .

now he is in office , change is expected both in foreign and domestic policy .
here the bbc 's team in washington tracks developments in the first 100 days of the obama presidency .
friday 6 february - day 18 1600 est obama 's new tone max deveson : president obama 's tone has changed on the stimulus package .
gone are the cocktail parties and appeals for bipartisan unity .
now , any delay for the stimulus bill is " inexcusable and irresponsible " , as mr obama said in his speech this morning .
and he made it pretty clear what he felt about republican attempts to amend the package .
" -lsb- the voters -rsb- did not send us to washington to get stuck in partisan posturing , or to turn back to the same tried and failed approaches that were rejected in the last election . "
will this new combative approach deliver the senate votes needed to pass the bill ?
if it does , then we might see it again during the coming legislative battles over healthcare and the economy .
thursday 5 february - day 17 1420 est who 's next for health ?
max deveson : with tom daschle out of the picture , washington is abuzz with speculation about who president obama will now pick as his health and human services secretary .
names in the frame include tennessee governor phil bredesen and former oregon governor john kitzhaber .
mr bredesen would ruffle feathers on the left -lrb- he cut his state 's health spending while in office -rrb- , while dr kitzhaber -lrb- before entering politics he was an emergency room physician -rrb- might be a bridge too far for the right of the party .
the compromise candidate might be kansas governor kathleen sebelius , who was an early obama backer in the election and has been hailed for her successful management of her state 's health system .
mind you - i lost a wager with a friend last summer that mr obama would pick ms sebelius as his running-mate , so perhaps my analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt ...
1350 est nascar cost-cutting kevin connolly : how fitting that president obama should start his day at the national prayer breakfast ; there at least he will have found hope and comfort - two commodities in short supply in the daily economic briefing he has now introduced .
it is not just the latest round of dire figures on unemployment and retail sales - wherever you look in the american economy , there are signs of strain .
i 'm at the international speedway on the florida coastline watching preparations for next week 's daytona 500 , traditional curtainraiser to the nascar motor-racing season .
-lrb- i 'll be reporting on it at length here in the coming days . -rrb-
even here the talk is of sponsors in dire straits -lrb- gm and ford are big players with big problems -rrb- , falling ad revenues and cost-cutting - the teams are reducing the number of practice laps to save money .
i do n't know if mr obama watches nascar in his scanty leisure time , but this year even the daytona 500 does n't offer much by way of escapism .
wednesday 4 february - day 16 1456 est will obama lift lid on guantanamo secrets ?
adam brookes : the obama administration is silent on whether it would allow uk courts to reveal details of guantanamo bay detainees ' experiences .
see the story of the brouhaha in the uk here binyam mohamed - a british resident now in guantanamo - says he was subject to " rendition " and torture .
the truth about his treatment lies in us intelligence documents .
a uk judge says he was pressured not to release the details of binyan mohamed 's treatment .
an interesting question here : the obama administration tells us guantanamo will close and it 's a new day in detention policy .
will the administration be prepared to lift the lid on what really happened to binyam mohamed and others like him ?
or do some secrets stay secret ? 1318 est populist pay caps kevin connolly : president obama has come up with a sure-fire populist gesture to change the subject after his recent run of bad headlines .
executives at companies bailed out by american taxpayers will be able to collect a maximum of $ 500,000 in salaries and bonuses until the money is paid back .
the president is quick to assert that america is still a society where they do n't begrudge wealth , but there 's been a backlash of popular anger against those celebrated fat cats of wall street who used $ 20bn of the first tranche of bailout funds to pay themselves bonuses after bringing the global economy to its knees .
no-one is quite suggesting that the financiers who hurled themselves from the upper storeys of manhattan skyscrapers during the wall street crash had the right idea , but america clearly feels that today 's titans of finance got it wrong .
watch the unfolding general motors saga to see where mr obama 's new rules take us - rick wagoner , the group ceo took home $ 14.5 million in 2007 .
if gm is bailed out next month , and the rules apply to detroit as well as wall street he 'll notice quite a difference in his pay packet .
tuesday 3 february - day 15 1350 est daschle out james coomarasamy : president obama has lost two of his nominees for top government positions over tax issues .
tom daschle has withdrawn from consideration as health and human services secretary - and nancy killefer will not be a candidate for the newly-created post of chief performance officer .
mr obama has been facing growing criticism over the contradiction between his pledge to create a new , ethical administration and the problems of his nominees .
both daschle and killefer said they did n't want to be a distraction from the president 's agenda .
my analysis of barack obama 's worst day in office so far 1230 est gregg pick official max deveson : barack obama has confirmed that he wants republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary .
but this will not mean the democrats get a filibuster-proof majority in the senate .
gregg reportedly only agreed to take the job on condition that he is replaced by a republican - and reports suggest that his former chief of staff bonnie newman is being lined up for the position .
meanwhile , it 's been revealed that back in 1995 he voted to abolish the department he is now set to lead .
0018 est ' buy american ' provisions risk backlash jonathan beale : is barack obama setting himself up for a new trade war ?
that question is being asked after democrats in the house and the senate made a " buy american " provision in the $ 800bn stimulus package .
it would require that the planned massive infrastructure projects use us-made materials .
to some big american companies and allies the " buy american " clause sounds like old fashioned protectionism .
after outcry from the eu , canada and the us chamber of commerce - all worried as to where this will lead - the white house now says it 's " reviewing the provision " .
but it leaves one wondering where an obama administration really stands on free trade .
remember barack obama on the campaign trail signalling that he could rip up bush 's nafta free trade agreements ?
at the time it was seen as a political gesture to win round the sceptical white working class vote .
mr obama wanted to reassure the unions that he was on their side .
perhaps that 's now become more important with the economic crises .
but if he allows the " buy american " clause to go through , he 'd better prepare for a backlash from the rest of the world .
monday 2 february - day 14 1540 est obama team gets the hollywood treatment rajini vaidyanathan : she 's more used to snapping a-list celebrities -lrb- one of her most famous pictures was of a naked , pregnant demi moore -rrb- , but now celebrity photographer annie leibovitz has turned her attention to the west wing .
in a series of pictures in this month 's vanity fair magazine , members of the obama administration have been given the leibovitz treatment .
the stylish shots include pictures of well-known members of the team like secretary of state hillary clinton and chief of staff rahm emanuel , as well as more junior staff like the white house social secretary , and the president 's speechwriter .
1150 est republican commerce secretary ?
max deveson : barack obama is set to nominate republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary , according to media reports .
i wrote about mr gregg last week , because he had been voting with the democrats on some crucial issues .
some liberal commentators have welcomed the prospect of mr gregg joining the cabinet - primarily because they are hoping that the man who would be charged with appointing his senate replacement - new hampshire governor john lynch , a democrat - will pick a fellow democrat .
one extra democrat -lrb- if , as expected , democrat al franken wins the disputed minnesota recount -rrb- , would give the party a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the senate .
it seems , however , that mr gregg is only going to take the job if mr lynch promises to replace him with a republican - or at least that 's what his party colleagues are hoping .
hillary and china kim ghattas : secretary of state hillary clinton will be lunching with treasury secretary timothy geithner .
the conversation will most likely focus on the world economic crisis and china in particular .
when mrs clinton spoke to journalists in her first news briefing last week , she said she was looking forward to working with her colleagues from other agencies , including mr geithner , to design " a more comprehensive approach that will be more in keeping with the important role that china is playing and will be playing " .
she took a subtle swipe at the bush administration saying the strategic dialogue between beijing and washington had become solely economic .
the world economic crisis means that finance , trade and foreign currency will be at the heart of diplomatic ties between countries around the world .
this gives mrs clinton another lever to make sure she is centre stage as well .
so as president obama 's team of rivals gets to work , the jockeying for position is starting .
friday 30 january - day 11 1945 est middle class empowerment rajini vaidyanathan : president obama has announced the creation of a " middle class task force " to raise living standards for , as the name suggests , middle-class us families .
it will be led by vice-president joe biden , who himself rose to the top from working class roots in scranton , pennsylvania .
the task force will host meetings with government agencies , business leaders , policy makers and community groups , to propose new policies and initiatives to help american families .
vice-president biden says the process will be totally transparent .
the accompanying website promises to post videos and minutes of meetings and allow people to submit their thoughts .
despite the promise of greater openness and engagement the task itself is a tough one .
will this task force be anything more than a talking shop , or will it be a fertilising ground for new policies ?
and even then , in uncertain economic times , can these new policies actually make a difference ? 1550 est obama and iran is president obama being " needlessly defensive and apologetic " in his overtures towards iran and the muslim world , as charles krauthammer argues ?
or is he in agreement with krauthammer 's basic position , but choosing to soften his rhetoric ?
the bbc 's north america editor justin webb offers his thoughts here .
1530 est x marks the spot rajini vaidyanathan : a treat for all you west wing fans ...

mr bredesen would ruffle feathers on the left -lrb- he cut his state 's health spending while in office -rrb- , while dr kitzhaber -lrb- before entering politics he was an emergency room physician -rrb- might be a bridge too far for the right of the party .
the compromise candidate might be kansas governor kathleen sebelius , who was an early obama backer in the election and has been hailed for her successful management of her state 's health system .
mind you - i lost a wager with a friend last summer that mr obama would pick ms sebelius as his running-mate , so perhaps my analysis should be taken with a pinch of salt ...
1350 est nascar cost-cutting kevin connolly : how fitting that president obama should start his day at the national prayer breakfast ; there at least he will have found hope and comfort - two commodities in short supply in the daily economic briefing he has now introduced .
it is not just the latest round of dire figures on unemployment and retail sales - wherever you look in the american economy , there are signs of strain .
i 'm at the international speedway on the florida coastline watching preparations for next week 's daytona 500 , traditional curtainraiser to the nascar motor-racing season .
-lrb- i 'll be reporting on it at length here in the coming days . -rrb-
even here the talk is of sponsors in dire straits -lrb- gm and ford are big players with big problems -rrb- , falling ad revenues and cost-cutting - the teams are reducing the number of practice laps to save money .
i do n't know if mr obama watches nascar in his scanty leisure time , but this year even the daytona 500 does n't offer much by way of escapism .
wednesday 4 february - day 16 1456 est will obama lift lid on guantanamo secrets ?
adam brookes : the obama administration is silent on whether it would allow uk courts to reveal details of guantanamo bay detainees ' experiences .
see the story of the brouhaha in the uk here binyam mohamed - a british resident now in guantanamo - says he was subject to " rendition " and torture .
the truth about his treatment lies in us intelligence documents .
a uk judge says he was pressured not to release the details of binyan mohamed 's treatment .
an interesting question here : the obama administration tells us guantanamo will close and it 's a new day in detention policy .
will the administration be prepared to lift the lid on what really happened to binyam mohamed and others like him ?
or do some secrets stay secret ? 1318 est populist pay caps kevin connolly : president obama has come up with a sure-fire populist gesture to change the subject after his recent run of bad headlines .
executives at companies bailed out by american taxpayers will be able to collect a maximum of $ 500,000 in salaries and bonuses until the money is paid back .
the president is quick to assert that america is still a society where they do n't begrudge wealth , but there 's been a backlash of popular anger against those celebrated fat cats of wall street who used $ 20bn of the first tranche of bailout funds to pay themselves bonuses after bringing the global economy to its knees .
no-one is quite suggesting that the financiers who hurled themselves from the upper storeys of manhattan skyscrapers during the wall street crash had the right idea , but america clearly feels that today 's titans of finance got it wrong .
watch the unfolding general motors saga to see where mr obama 's new rules take us - rick wagoner , the group ceo took home $ 14.5 million in 2007 .
if gm is bailed out next month , and the rules apply to detroit as well as wall street he 'll notice quite a difference in his pay packet .
tuesday 3 february - day 15 1350 est daschle out james coomarasamy : president obama has lost two of his nominees for top government positions over tax issues .
tom daschle has withdrawn from consideration as health and human services secretary - and nancy killefer will not be a candidate for the newly-created post of chief performance officer .
mr obama has been facing growing criticism over the contradiction between his pledge to create a new , ethical administration and the problems of his nominees .
both daschle and killefer said they did n't want to be a distraction from the president 's agenda .
my analysis of barack obama 's worst day in office so far 1230 est gregg pick official max deveson : barack obama has confirmed that he wants republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary .
but this will not mean the democrats get a filibuster-proof majority in the senate .
gregg reportedly only agreed to take the job on condition that he is replaced by a republican - and reports suggest that his former chief of staff bonnie newman is being lined up for the position .
meanwhile , it 's been revealed that back in 1995 he voted to abolish the department he is now set to lead .
0018 est ' buy american ' provisions risk backlash jonathan beale : is barack obama setting himself up for a new trade war ?
that question is being asked after democrats in the house and the senate made a " buy american " provision in the $ 800bn stimulus package .
it would require that the planned massive infrastructure projects use us-made materials .
to some big american companies and allies the " buy american " clause sounds like old fashioned protectionism .
after outcry from the eu , canada and the us chamber of commerce - all worried as to where this will lead - the white house now says it 's " reviewing the provision " .
but it leaves one wondering where an obama administration really stands on free trade .
remember barack obama on the campaign trail signalling that he could rip up bush 's nafta free trade agreements ?
at the time it was seen as a political gesture to win round the sceptical white working class vote .
mr obama wanted to reassure the unions that he was on their side .
perhaps that 's now become more important with the economic crises .
but if he allows the " buy american " clause to go through , he 'd better prepare for a backlash from the rest of the world .
monday 2 february - day 14 1540 est obama team gets the hollywood treatment rajini vaidyanathan : she 's more used to snapping a-list celebrities -lrb- one of her most famous pictures was of a naked , pregnant demi moore -rrb- , but now celebrity photographer annie leibovitz has turned her attention to the west wing .
in a series of pictures in this month 's vanity fair magazine , members of the obama administration have been given the leibovitz treatment .
the stylish shots include pictures of well-known members of the team like secretary of state hillary clinton and chief of staff rahm emanuel , as well as more junior staff like the white house social secretary , and the president 's speechwriter .
1150 est republican commerce secretary ?
max deveson : barack obama is set to nominate republican senator judd gregg to be his commerce secretary , according to media reports .
i wrote about mr gregg last week , because he had been voting with the democrats on some crucial issues .
some liberal commentators have welcomed the prospect of mr gregg joining the cabinet - primarily because they are hoping that the man who would be charged with appointing his senate replacement - new hampshire governor john lynch , a democrat - will pick a fellow democrat .
one extra democrat -lrb- if , as expected , democrat al franken wins the disputed minnesota recount -rrb- , would give the party a filibuster-proof 60 votes in the senate .
it seems , however , that mr gregg is only going to take the job if mr lynch promises to replace him with a republican - or at least that 's what his party colleagues are hoping .
hillary and china kim ghattas : secretary of state hillary clinton will be lunching with treasury secretary timothy geithner .
the conversation will most likely focus on the world economic crisis and china in particular .
when mrs clinton spoke to journalists in her first news briefing last week , she said she was looking forward to working with her colleagues from other agencies , including mr geithner , to design " a more comprehensive approach that will be more in keeping with the important role that china is playing and will be playing " .
she took a subtle swipe at the bush administration saying the strategic dialogue between beijing and washington had become solely economic .
the world economic crisis means that finance , trade and foreign currency will be at the heart of diplomatic ties between countries around the world .
this gives mrs clinton another lever to make sure she is centre stage as well .
so as president obama 's team of rivals gets to work , the jockeying for position is starting .
friday 30 january - day 11 1945 est middle class empowerment rajini vaidyanathan : president obama has announced the creation of a " middle class task force " to raise living standards for , as the name suggests , middle-class us families .
it will be led by vice-president joe biden , who himself rose to the top from working class roots in scranton , pennsylvania .
the task force will host meetings with government agencies , business leaders , policy makers and community groups , to propose new policies and initiatives to help american families .
vice-president biden says the process will be totally transparent .
the accompanying website promises to post videos and minutes of meetings and allow people to submit their thoughts .
despite the promise of greater openness and engagement the task itself is a tough one .
will this task force be anything more than a talking shop , or will it be a fertilising ground for new policies ?
and even then , in uncertain economic times , can these new policies actually make a difference ? 1550 est obama and iran is president obama being " needlessly defensive and apologetic " in his overtures towards iran and the muslim world , as charles krauthammer argues ?
or is he in agreement with krauthammer 's basic position , but choosing to soften his rhetoric ?
the bbc 's north america editor justin webb offers his thoughts here .
1530 est x marks the spot rajini vaidyanathan : a treat for all you west wing fans ...
here is a link to the washington post 's map of the real " obama west wing " .
