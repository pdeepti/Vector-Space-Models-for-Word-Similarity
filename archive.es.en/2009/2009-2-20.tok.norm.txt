it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .
other nato members are also facing pressure to add to the us ' troop commitment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.02.2009 german parliament approves 50-billion-euro stimulus plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new package includes some 17 billion euros in infrastructure spending the upper house of parliament on friday approved the german government 's 50-billion- euro -lrb- $ 63 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan aimed to lift europe 's largest economy out of its worst post-war recession . approved on friday , feb .
20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .

some say the measures , which also include the creation of civilian anti-crime patrols and longer detention for illegal immigrants , target foreigners . the measures contained in a decree approved by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet on friday , feb .
20 , come in the wake of several widely publicized rape cases , including three last weekend in rome , milan and bologna . they also follow rioting by tunisian would-be immigrants protesting their repatriation from a detention center on the island in lampedusa . " the government is not acting on a wave of emotion , " berlusconi , who has taken a hard line against illegal immigration , told reporters .
he said his cabinet was working to keep the center-right 's april 2008 election promise to combat crime and curb illegal immigration . rape cases declined 10 percent in 2008 , compared to the 2006-2007 period when italy was governed by the center-left , berlusconi said . criticism of " xenophobic " attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election promises to fight crime and illegal immigration helped him to victory romanian rights groups , however , on friday issued a joint statement condemning recent " xenophobic attitudes and attacks " in italy after a series of rapes were blamed on immigrants . earlier this week , four romanians were attacked by masked assailants in a rome restaurant , supposedly in response to allegations that the sex crimes had been committed by eastern european and northern african men . in january , six romanian men were convicted of arrested in the gang-rape of a woman . mandatory life sentences the italian decree , which goes into effect immediately but still has to be approved by both houses of parliament within 60 days , introduces mandatory life sentences for people convicted of gang-rape , sexual assault resulting in murder and violent sexual abuse of children . those charged with such crimes , as well as suspects " caught in the act " for child prostitution , child pornography and sex tourism crimes committed abroad , will also be kept in jail while awaiting trial , according to the decree . recent decisions by magistrates to issue house arrest instead of prison orders to several rape suspects have triggered public outcry in italy . civilian anti-crime patrols the decree also contains a controversial clause allowing mayors to recruit civilians to conduct anti-crime patrols in towns and city . italy 's opposition says the measure could lead civilians to take the law into their own hands and make them more likely to target immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in lampedusa at the end of january interior minister roberto maroni denied this , saying the patrols would ideally consist of retired policemen , off-duty soldiers and fire fighters . " they will not carry weapons and will only be equipped with radio transmitters or mobile phones to alert police , " he said . longer detention for immigrants furthermore , the decree approved friday increases from two to six months the period in which would-be immigrants may be held in detention centers . maroni said that this would allow for their proper identification and for arranging their repatriation with the authorities of their countries of origin . human rights activists , the roman catholic church and much of italy 's opposition have said this will lead to overcrowding at the detention centers and that health and security risks will result . maroni said the government plans to convert former army barracks into detention centers for illegal immigrants and make use of other structures that are located " away from urban centers and preferably close to airports , " in order to " ease swift repatriation .

some say the measures , which also include the creation of civilian anti-crime patrols and longer detention for illegal immigrants , target foreigners . the measures contained in a decree approved by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet on friday , feb .
20 , come in the wake of several widely publicized rape cases , including three last weekend in rome , milan and bologna . they also follow rioting by tunisian would-be immigrants protesting their repatriation from a detention center on the island in lampedusa . " the government is not acting on a wave of emotion , " berlusconi , who has taken a hard line against illegal immigration , told reporters .
he said his cabinet was working to keep the center-right 's april 2008 election promise to combat crime and curb illegal immigration . rape cases declined 10 percent in 2008 , compared to the 2006-2007 period when italy was governed by the center-left , berlusconi said . criticism of " xenophobic " attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election promises to fight crime and illegal immigration helped him to victory romanian rights groups , however , on friday issued a joint statement condemning recent " xenophobic attitudes and attacks " in italy after a series of rapes were blamed on immigrants . earlier this week , four romanians were attacked by masked assailants in a rome restaurant , supposedly in response to allegations that the sex crimes had been committed by eastern european and northern african men . in january , six romanian men were convicted of arrested in the gang-rape of a woman . mandatory life sentences the italian decree , which goes into effect immediately but still has to be approved by both houses of parliament within 60 days , introduces mandatory life sentences for people convicted of gang-rape , sexual assault resulting in murder and violent sexual abuse of children . those charged with such crimes , as well as suspects " caught in the act " for child prostitution , child pornography and sex tourism crimes committed abroad , will also be kept in jail while awaiting trial , according to the decree . recent decisions by magistrates to issue house arrest instead of prison orders to several rape suspects have triggered public outcry in italy . civilian anti-crime patrols the decree also contains a controversial clause allowing mayors to recruit civilians to conduct anti-crime patrols in towns and city . italy 's opposition says the measure could lead civilians to take the law into their own hands and make them more likely to target immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in lampedusa at the end of january interior minister roberto maroni denied this , saying the patrols would ideally consist of retired policemen , off-duty soldiers and fire fighters . " they will not carry weapons and will only be equipped with radio transmitters or mobile phones to alert police , " he said . longer detention for immigrants furthermore , the decree approved friday increases from two to six months the period in which would-be immigrants may be held in detention centers . maroni said that this would allow for their proper identification and for arranging their repatriation with the authorities of their countries of origin . human rights activists , the roman catholic church and much of italy 's opposition have said this will lead to overcrowding at the detention centers and that health and security risks will result . maroni said the government plans to convert former army barracks into detention centers for illegal immigrants and make use of other structures that are located " away from urban centers and preferably close to airports , " in order to " ease swift repatriation .

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .

many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .

the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons . "
germany has rejected the charge . seven other eu states - poland , romania , spain , cyprus , ireland , portugal and greece - were accused of " active or passive collusion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu welcomes obama 's plans to close guantanamo in addition , poland and romania may have harbored cia detention centers , according to a 2006 council of europe report . parliament says closing guantanamo not enough the extraordinary renditions have been widely criticized , since the sept .
11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us . in the week following his inauguration last month , new us president barack obama expressed his intention to close the guantanamo bay detention center , a move which the meps called " a big step forward . " however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities .

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .
other nato members are also facing pressure to add to the us ' troop commitment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.02.2009 opel , saab struggle amid deepening financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's troubles have spread to its european subsidiaries caught up in the crisis plaguing us parent company general motors , sweden 's saab filed for bankruptcy protection friday while german carmaker opel said it needed billions to weather the downturn . loss-making saab became the first european casualty of ailing gm 's global shakeup as it filed for bankruptcy protection and applied to be spun off as an independent company .
that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .
restructuring could allow some parts of saab to survive and enable suppliers to , at least , recover some of their money . opel suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if opel goes under in germany , finance minister peer steinbrueck and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have not ruled out the possibility of state aid or guarantees to opel , but said it was dependent on gm presenting a viable restructuring concept . the news magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the ruesselsheim-based automaker was suffering more than expected as a result of the dramatic slide in european markets . this week , executives from the us parent company said for the first time that they were ready to take on partners or share control of the german automotive firm with a third party . analysts said thursday that the company needed a strategic partner to survive .
unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .
saab is smaller , with a workforce of some 4,100 people in sweden , 3,700 of them at its trollhaettan plant .
a total of 15,000 swedish jobs are believed to be at risk if the company closed . the cars division of volvo , sweden 's other major auto brand and a subsidiary of us automotive giant ford , is also making a loss and up for sale and many other big manufacturing firms have made job cuts as export order books dry up . general motors presented its restructuring plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion government bridging loan .
it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than 1 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jg / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .

21 , schroeder was set to say , " the holocaust is a historical fact .
it makes no sense to deny this unique crime which hitler 's germany was responsible for . " the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said it had obtained a copy of the former chancellors ' speech on friday . schroeder was also to say in the speech that a regional power which wanted to be taken seriously had to recognize realities , respect international rules and make concessions . according to the speech draft , schroeder says he recognizes iran has its own vital security interests , but that teheran should guarantee israel 's security , too . appeal for us-iran dialogue in addition , he was to call for iran and the united states to enter direct high-level talks about iran 's nuclear research projects .
upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.02.2009 opel , saab struggle amid deepening financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's troubles have spread to its european subsidiaries caught up in the crisis plaguing us parent company general motors , sweden 's saab filed for bankruptcy protection friday while german carmaker opel said it needed billions to weather the downturn . loss-making saab became the first european casualty of ailing gm 's global shakeup as it filed for bankruptcy protection and applied to be spun off as an independent company .
that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .
restructuring could allow some parts of saab to survive and enable suppliers to , at least , recover some of their money . opel suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if opel goes under in germany , finance minister peer steinbrueck and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have not ruled out the possibility of state aid or guarantees to opel , but said it was dependent on gm presenting a viable restructuring concept . the news magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the ruesselsheim-based automaker was suffering more than expected as a result of the dramatic slide in european markets . this week , executives from the us parent company said for the first time that they were ready to take on partners or share control of the german automotive firm with a third party . analysts said thursday that the company needed a strategic partner to survive .
unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .
saab is smaller , with a workforce of some 4,100 people in sweden , 3,700 of them at its trollhaettan plant .
a total of 15,000 swedish jobs are believed to be at risk if the company closed . the cars division of volvo , sweden 's other major auto brand and a subsidiary of us automotive giant ford , is also making a loss and up for sale and many other big manufacturing firms have made job cuts as export order books dry up . general motors presented its restructuring plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion government bridging loan .
it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than 1 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jg / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , schroeder was set to say , " the holocaust is a historical fact .
it makes no sense to deny this unique crime which hitler 's germany was responsible for . " the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said it had obtained a copy of the former chancellors ' speech on friday . schroeder was also to say in the speech that a regional power which wanted to be taken seriously had to recognize realities , respect international rules and make concessions . according to the speech draft , schroeder says he recognizes iran has its own vital security interests , but that teheran should guarantee israel 's security , too . appeal for us-iran dialogue in addition , he was to call for iran and the united states to enter direct high-level talks about iran 's nuclear research projects .
upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons .

" britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons . "
germany has rejected the charge . seven other eu states - poland , romania , spain , cyprus , ireland , portugal and greece - were accused of " active or passive collusion .

" however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities . " britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons .

" however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities . " britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 20.02.2009 opel , saab struggle amid deepening financial crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm 's troubles have spread to its european subsidiaries caught up in the crisis plaguing us parent company general motors , sweden 's saab filed for bankruptcy protection friday while german carmaker opel said it needed billions to weather the downturn . loss-making saab became the first european casualty of ailing gm 's global shakeup as it filed for bankruptcy protection and applied to be spun off as an independent company .
that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .

the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .

many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .

unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons . "
germany has rejected the charge . seven other eu states - poland , romania , spain , cyprus , ireland , portugal and greece - were accused of " active or passive collusion .

" however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities . " britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons .

21 , schroeder was set to say , " the holocaust is a historical fact .
it makes no sense to deny this unique crime which hitler 's germany was responsible for . " the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said it had obtained a copy of the former chancellors ' speech on friday . schroeder was also to say in the speech that a regional power which wanted to be taken seriously had to recognize realities , respect international rules and make concessions . according to the speech draft , schroeder says he recognizes iran has its own vital security interests , but that teheran should guarantee israel 's security , too . appeal for us-iran dialogue in addition , he was to call for iran and the united states to enter direct high-level talks about iran 's nuclear research projects .
upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .
other nato members are also facing pressure to add to the us ' troop commitment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons .

" britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .
other nato members are also facing pressure to add to the us ' troop commitment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , schroeder was set to say , " the holocaust is a historical fact .
it makes no sense to deny this unique crime which hitler 's germany was responsible for . " the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said it had obtained a copy of the former chancellors ' speech on friday . schroeder was also to say in the speech that a regional power which wanted to be taken seriously had to recognize realities , respect international rules and make concessions . according to the speech draft , schroeder says he recognizes iran has its own vital security interests , but that teheran should guarantee israel 's security , too . appeal for us-iran dialogue in addition , he was to call for iran and the united states to enter direct high-level talks about iran 's nuclear research projects .
upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .
other nato members are also facing pressure to add to the us ' troop commitment . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .

unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons . "
germany has rejected the charge . seven other eu states - poland , romania , spain , cyprus , ireland , portugal and greece - were accused of " active or passive collusion . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu welcomes obama 's plans to close guantanamo in addition , poland and romania may have harbored cia detention centers , according to a 2006 council of europe report . parliament says closing guantanamo not enough the extraordinary renditions have been widely criticized , since the sept .

" however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities . " britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .

unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .

" sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .
restructuring could allow some parts of saab to survive and enable suppliers to , at least , recover some of their money . opel suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if opel goes under in germany , finance minister peer steinbrueck and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have not ruled out the possibility of state aid or guarantees to opel , but said it was dependent on gm presenting a viable restructuring concept . the news magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the ruesselsheim-based automaker was suffering more than expected as a result of the dramatic slide in european markets . this week , executives from the us parent company said for the first time that they were ready to take on partners or share control of the german automotive firm with a third party . analysts said thursday that the company needed a strategic partner to survive .
unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .
saab is smaller , with a workforce of some 4,100 people in sweden , 3,700 of them at its trollhaettan plant .
a total of 15,000 swedish jobs are believed to be at risk if the company closed . the cars division of volvo , sweden 's other major auto brand and a subsidiary of us automotive giant ford , is also making a loss and up for sale and many other big manufacturing firms have made job cuts as export order books dry up . general motors presented its restructuring plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion government bridging loan .

19 , with 78 votes for and one vote against , russian news agencies reported .
it comes one day after us president barack obama ordered 17,000 more forces to afghanistan to combat a growing taliban insurgency .
the united states has 180 days to close the manas facility - the only us air base in central asia - the head of the country 's security council , adukhan madumarov said earlier .
the us state department said it was still in talks with the kyrgyz government and would wait for president kurmanbek bakiyev to sign the legislation into law before beginning its official withdrawal .
contingency plans were already underway and spokesman gordon duguid insisted the base 's closure would have no real impact on the us and nato 's afghanistan operations .
" we will be able to continue our operations in afghanistan fully and completely .
the pentagon is renowned for its ability to move troops , equipment , and other material to all parts of the world , " duguid said .
possible influence from russia russia has agreed to allow supply routes for nato and us troops to afghanistan through its southern territory .
there has been speculation that russia had intensified pressure on the former soviet republic to terminate the lease .
while moscow had approved setting up the base in 2001 to support operations in afghanistan , russian officials have long been suspicious of the us military presence in the region .
russia has denied allegations that a $ 2-billion aid package to financially-strapped kyrgyzstan acted as an incentive to speed up the closure .
obama has vowed to scale up the us presence in afghanistan as he draws down troops from iraq .

21 , schroeder was set to say , " the holocaust is a historical fact .
it makes no sense to deny this unique crime which hitler 's germany was responsible for . " the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said it had obtained a copy of the former chancellors ' speech on friday . schroeder was also to say in the speech that a regional power which wanted to be taken seriously had to recognize realities , respect international rules and make concessions . according to the speech draft , schroeder says he recognizes iran has its own vital security interests , but that teheran should guarantee israel 's security , too . appeal for us-iran dialogue in addition , he was to call for iran and the united states to enter direct high-level talks about iran 's nuclear research projects .
upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons . "
germany has rejected the charge . seven other eu states - poland , romania , spain , cyprus , ireland , portugal and greece - were accused of " active or passive collusion .

" however , they added that the president 's orders " do not seem to fully address the issues of secret detention and abduction or the use of torture . " the parliament also said that officials from some european states had interrogated prisoners of guantanamo or other detention centers , " thus legitimizing the existence of these facilities . " britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 , the plan includes investments in infrastructure , tax relief , reductions in health care contributions and money for families with children .
the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .
11 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package also includes a 2,500-euro bonus to people who junk old cars to buy new vehicles .
the upper house , which represents germany 's 16 states , approved the new plan after its first package was met with criticism both in germany and abroad .
the old plan called for a stimulus of 31 billion euros and was considered too cautious .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel was full of praise for the new initiative , being touted as a " pact for germany , " which her coalition passed on tuesday , jan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier : germany is sending a message of economic responsibility merkel has said that her government is doing " everything possible so that germany does not just overcome this crisis , but emerges from it stronger . "
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier from merkel 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , said the german package of investments , government loans and hand-outs , and tax cuts , compared favorably with stimulus measures taken by other nations .
" when i look around europe , i ca n't see anyone else doing more or taking better steps than we are , " he told reporters .
a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .
" if we approved all the applications that have been submitted unofficially , the 100 billion euros would be insufficient , " a source told the newspaper .
new plan means massive debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there will be even more debt to clock with the new stimulus plan the approved stimulus plan will also force germany to take on about 37 billion euros in new debt , a fact that displeases the association of german taxpayers .
in an official statement , association president karl heinz daeke called the measures a " smokescreen to distract from -lsb- the absence of -rsb- true tax relief . "
he also criticized the government premium of 2,500 euros to be paid to people who scrap their old cars and buy new ones , saying the auto industry would have benefited more from direct tax cuts . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .
restructuring could allow some parts of saab to survive and enable suppliers to , at least , recover some of their money . opel suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if opel goes under in germany , finance minister peer steinbrueck and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have not ruled out the possibility of state aid or guarantees to opel , but said it was dependent on gm presenting a viable restructuring concept . the news magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the ruesselsheim-based automaker was suffering more than expected as a result of the dramatic slide in european markets . this week , executives from the us parent company said for the first time that they were ready to take on partners or share control of the german automotive firm with a third party . analysts said thursday that the company needed a strategic partner to survive .
unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .
saab is smaller , with a workforce of some 4,100 people in sweden , 3,700 of them at its trollhaettan plant .
a total of 15,000 swedish jobs are believed to be at risk if the company closed . the cars division of volvo , sweden 's other major auto brand and a subsidiary of us automotive giant ford , is also making a loss and up for sale and many other big manufacturing firms have made job cuts as export order books dry up . general motors presented its restructuring plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion government bridging loan .
it pledged to cut 47,000 jobs worldwide , to close plants , dump brands and slash production , notably in europe where it seeks to save more than 1 billion euros . dw staff -lrb- jg / dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .
it 's meant to prepare the ground and develop a common european position on restructuring global financial rules ahead of a g20 summit in london on april 2 . dw staff -lrb- dfm / sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .

a historic package for an historic slump with demand for the country 's exports crippled by the global financial crisis , germany 's economy entered a recession last year and is expected to shrink by more than two percent this year – marking its worst performance postwar .
the new measures also include 100 billion euros in loan guarantees but the business daily newspaper handelsblatt reported on friday that the amount will be insufficient based on preliminary requests alone .

that move came after gm decided to cut the cult brand adrift after the swedish government refused to inject money into the auto manufacturer . the future of opel looked equally uncertain friday as reports surfaced that the german subsidiary would need more than 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees from the german government - nearly double original estimates - to weather the downturn . opel confirmed the upward revision of original figures , believed to have stood at around 1.8 billion euros in loan guarantees , but would not specify the revised amount . however , a member of opel 's supervisory board , armin schild , confirmed friday that the carmaker needed at least 3.3 billion euros to weather the financial crisis , news agency ap reported . schild said that if the german government provided the revised loan guarantees , opel would be able to step away from its reliance on gm , ap reported . global slump bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is worried about the fallout from the us opel said that sales in important markets such as spain had collapsed to a degree that had not been foreseeable late last year . since initial assessments , " the situation with regards to sales has changed dramatically in the large european markets , " opel said in justification of the revised loan guarantee estimates . " on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .

many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .

unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .

" on top of that are the consequences - painful for opel - of exchange rate changes in markets such as britain , " the carmaker said , adding that these were factors that needed to be taken into account in the request for state guarantees . filing for reorganization meanwhile , in sweden , saab spokeswoman margareta hogstrom confirmed that an application to reorganize the brand into an independent company had been filed .
the process of reorganization in sweden is roughly equivalent to going into chapter 11 bankruptcy in the us . the reorganization will place saab under court supervision with the aim of creating a " fully independent " business entity , according to a press statement issued by the company .
the process is likely to take some three months , saab said . " reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market while minimizing the liquidity impact of saab on gm , " ceo jan ake jonsson said in the statement .
" we explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and / or selling saab . " sweden unimpressed by gm offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are difficult times for saab ceo jan ake jonsson swedish daily dagens industri said gm had told unions at a saab board meeting on thursday that it was prepared to put 3.5 billion swedish krona -lrb- 320 million euros , $ 400 million -rrb- into the firm if the swedish government guaranteed a 5.2 billion krona loan . but the government , locked in an increasingly acrimonious stand-off with gm , refused to accede to the request .
many analysts speculate that the firm will need much more money to turn it around . stockholm accuses the us company of failing to make the necessary investments to create attractive models and maintain its technological edge . the swedish government on wednesday said that it would not take over ownership of the company and during question time in parliament on thursday , enterprise minister maud olofsson said " it is not the government that should salvage saab , it is up to gm . " cutting legal ties could save gm hundreds of millions of dollars in costs if saab were to go bankrupt . saab made an operating loss of 2.19 billion swedish krona in 2007 , according to regulatory filings .
gm bought 50 percent of saab in 1990 and took full control in 2000 .
it has long been unprofitable . observers say the company faces a difficult mission to survive in its current form in today 's economic climate .
restructuring could allow some parts of saab to survive and enable suppliers to , at least , recover some of their money . opel suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of jobs could be lost if opel goes under in germany , finance minister peer steinbrueck and economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg have not ruled out the possibility of state aid or guarantees to opel , but said it was dependent on gm presenting a viable restructuring concept . the news magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the ruesselsheim-based automaker was suffering more than expected as a result of the dramatic slide in european markets . this week , executives from the us parent company said for the first time that they were ready to take on partners or share control of the german automotive firm with a third party . analysts said thursday that the company needed a strategic partner to survive .
unions also agree that the company could not go it alone because it is too small .
sales fell by 10 percent last year to 1.5 million vehicles . auto industry expert willi diez told germany 's bild newspaper that an indian or chinese manufacturer could take over opel . " the indian tata concern , or the chinese manufacturers chery and geely would be potentially interested in the germany company , " he said . jobs on the line opel employs around 26,000 people in germany in four plants .
saab is smaller , with a workforce of some 4,100 people in sweden , 3,700 of them at its trollhaettan plant .
a total of 15,000 swedish jobs are believed to be at risk if the company closed . the cars division of volvo , sweden 's other major auto brand and a subsidiary of us automotive giant ford , is also making a loss and up for sale and many other big manufacturing firms have made job cuts as export order books dry up . general motors presented its restructuring plan to the us treasury on tuesday as a condition of its $ 13.4 billion government bridging loan .

upon arriving in tehran on thursday , he said that he hoped the us and iran would " choose a new approach . "
the two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1979 . the ex-chancellor reportedly says he does not object to iran using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes , but that it was equally clear that the number of states in possession of nuclear weapons should not increase , and those in possession should disarm . schroeder attended on friday the inauguration of a neuroscience center co-founded by the germany-based iranian specialist majid samii , a long-time acquaintance who lives in schroeder 's hometown hanover . though the former chancellor had said he would also discuss " political issues " with top iranian leaders during his four-day visit , he added that he was not bringing any particular message from washington . schroeder served as chancellor of germany from 1998 to 2005 and did not visit iran during that time . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .

financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .

" especially an economy like the german one obviously relies on the economy of its neighboring states and neighboring markets not suffering too much , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . " that 's why a process is now starting to consider to what extent support via ... the economically strong countries of the euro zone countries can happen , " he said .
germany calls for coordinated effort his comments come amid reports of a widening of bond yield spreads as euro countries borrow millions to protect their economies from the global financial crisis .
" in light of widening interest rates for state borrowing in the euro zone , a common approach by the european union , the european central bank and the eurogroup is needed to discuss measures with countries involved to resolve the trend , " the german finance ministry said in a statement .
a yield spread is effectively a way of comparing any two financial products and the risk involved in investing in one product over the other .
financially weaker euro zone members such as greece and ireland have had to pay higher interest rates on sovereign bonds because of greater fears their troubled economies could falter and lead to a default on payments . stronger euro zone states such as germany have benefited from lower sovereign bond interest rates reflecting the relative safety of their economies .
this widening of bond yield spreads has raised alarm bells over rising budget deficits among financially weaker eu member states .
euro zone concerns to overshadow summit german finance minister peer steinbrueck said in a speech this week that all euro zone members would have to pitch in to help troubled euro zone countries " if it came to a serious situation , " though eu rules state that countries within the currency area should not directly help one another .
german magazine der spiegel reported on friday that the german finance ministry was studying the possibility of credit-worthy euro countries issuing a " bilateral bond " on behalf of another state in need .
it said it was also mulling whether bigger eu countries could issue a joint bond or the possibility of an eu rescue package . the german finance ministry however denied the report .
concerns over the worsening economic situation in some euro zone countries and the financial stability of some eastern european nations are likely to figure on the agenda at a summit hosted by german chancellor angela merkel on sunday .
the meeting will be attended by the leaders of britain , france , italy , spain , the netherlands , czech republic and luxembourg , as well as top european central bankers .

some say the measures , which also include the creation of civilian anti-crime patrols and longer detention for illegal immigrants , target foreigners . the measures contained in a decree approved by prime minister silvio berlusconi 's cabinet on friday , feb .
20 , come in the wake of several widely publicized rape cases , including three last weekend in rome , milan and bologna . they also follow rioting by tunisian would-be immigrants protesting their repatriation from a detention center on the island in lampedusa . " the government is not acting on a wave of emotion , " berlusconi , who has taken a hard line against illegal immigration , told reporters .
he said his cabinet was working to keep the center-right 's april 2008 election promise to combat crime and curb illegal immigration . rape cases declined 10 percent in 2008 , compared to the 2006-2007 period when italy was governed by the center-left , berlusconi said . criticism of " xenophobic " attitudes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi 's election promises to fight crime and illegal immigration helped him to victory romanian rights groups , however , on friday issued a joint statement condemning recent " xenophobic attitudes and attacks " in italy after a series of rapes were blamed on immigrants . earlier this week , four romanians were attacked by masked assailants in a rome restaurant , supposedly in response to allegations that the sex crimes had been committed by eastern european and northern african men . in january , six romanian men were convicted of arrested in the gang-rape of a woman . mandatory life sentences the italian decree , which goes into effect immediately but still has to be approved by both houses of parliament within 60 days , introduces mandatory life sentences for people convicted of gang-rape , sexual assault resulting in murder and violent sexual abuse of children . those charged with such crimes , as well as suspects " caught in the act " for child prostitution , child pornography and sex tourism crimes committed abroad , will also be kept in jail while awaiting trial , according to the decree . recent decisions by magistrates to issue house arrest instead of prison orders to several rape suspects have triggered public outcry in italy . civilian anti-crime patrols the decree also contains a controversial clause allowing mayors to recruit civilians to conduct anti-crime patrols in towns and city . italy 's opposition says the measure could lead civilians to take the law into their own hands and make them more likely to target immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in lampedusa at the end of january interior minister roberto maroni denied this , saying the patrols would ideally consist of retired policemen , off-duty soldiers and fire fighters . " they will not carry weapons and will only be equipped with radio transmitters or mobile phones to alert police , " he said . longer detention for immigrants furthermore , the decree approved friday increases from two to six months the period in which would-be immigrants may be held in detention centers . maroni said that this would allow for their proper identification and for arranging their repatriation with the authorities of their countries of origin . human rights activists , the roman catholic church and much of italy 's opposition have said this will lead to overcrowding at the detention centers and that health and security risks will result . maroni said the government plans to convert former army barracks into detention centers for illegal immigrants and make use of other structures that are located " away from urban centers and preferably close to airports , " in order to " ease swift repatriation .

it accused 14 members of cooperating with the us in the kidnapping or transport of terror suspects . the european parliament denounced members ' involvement in extraordinary renditions in a resolution approved with a 334-247 vote on thursday , feb .
19 .
the resolution , which was welcomed by amnesty international , comes two years after the parliament 's report on european complicity in illegal cia renditions . parliamentarians confirmed thursday that several eu member states had " been involved , or had cooperated actively or passively with the us authorities " in illegal activities .
some guantanamo bay prisoners were kidnapped in eu member states by us authorities or flown over eu territory , making stopovers in europe in some cases , said the parliament . according to the report , sweden , bosnia-herzegovina , britain , italy , macedonia , germany and turkey were " responsible at varying degrees … for violations of the rights of specific persons .

" britain accused of unlawfully detaining prisoners also on thursday , the european court of human rights found britain guilty of unlawfully detaining nine men under the anti-terrorism law it passed after the sept .
11 attacks . the men , suspected of having ties with al-qaeda , had been held in high-security prisons .
they said they were detained arbitrarily and had suffered inhuman treatment . the court ruled that the detention of the men was unlawful , but did not find britain guilty of subjecting them to degrading treatment . london has denied the accusations , saying the prisoners had ties with islamic extremist groups , but it was not immediately clear whether the government would appeal thursday 's rulung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the 91-year-old former forces ' sweetheart - who is said to be consulting her lawyers - is unlikely to win any legal battle against the bnp .
this is because , like many other older musicians , she has lost the rights over any material she recorded more than 50 years ago .
now that may change , as a directive currently working its way through the european parliament will , if passed and then approved by the council of ministers , extend performers ' copyright beyond the current limit .
the rules aim to extend performers ' copyright to up to 95 years after songs were recorded .
it would mean that performers , or their heirs , and their record companies would be paid every time their old recordings - which would be copyright-free under current rules - were broadcast .
there is nothing to stop a creative person using an old recording as part of their work - as long as they do not release it record industry source downloading old songs would also come at a price - with recording companies likely to get the lion 's share of any money to be made .
the rules would not be retrospective , and would apply only to songs about to slip out of copyright .
but the appetite for change is being partially driven by the prospect of huge amounts of popular material from the 1960s - such as beatles songs - becoming royalty-free over the next few years .
supporters - including dame vera and sir cliff richard - say it is unfair long-standing musicians lose rights over their own material in their lifetimes .
they say it denies them income which they honestly earned .
but critics say the new rules will " stifle creativity " and that it is the record companies , not the artists who will benefit most .
showbusiness lawyer nigel angel - who represents dame vera - said he had " nothing to add " on the reported row between his client and the bnp .
but he confirmed that other older musicians he represented were concerned at losing out on royalty income in their later years .
" some of them have no pensions and need this money , " he said .
" you are either gifted or good at business .
it 's rare to be both . "
hits affected by change lonnie donegan - my old man 's a dustman everly brothers - cathy 's clown eddie cochrane - three steps to heaven johnny kidd and the pirates - shakin ' all over shadows - apache ricky valence - tell laura i love her roy orbison - only the lonely elvis presley - it 's now or never jonathan morrish of ppl - which represents the rights of 38,000 performers and their record companies - said " millions " of songs would be lifted into copyright if the rules were changed .
" about 90 % of our performers earn less that £ 15,000 a year , and even a few hundred pounds extra would mean an awful lot to them . "
negotiations are ongoing about precisely how long performers ' copyright should last .
a few countries - like the netherlands - have opposed any change to current rules .
the record industry favours 95 years , but uk ministers say this period " goes beyond " what is necessary to protect performers ' interests .
the cd being sold by the bnp is also available from many other outlets intellectual property minister david lammy confirmed that performers " should be protected throughout their lifetime . "
a european parliament source confirmed that a compromise 70-year extension was currently being discussed .
opponents of copyright extension say any benefits accruing to older performers are outweighed by the " stifling of creativity " .
professor lionel bently , of cambridge university 's centre for intellectual property and information law , said extending copyright risked putting thousands of recordings - free to use under current rules - out of the reach of other artists and fans .
" for instance , it means that someone who wants to put up a website about , for example , the history of jazz will now have to seek permission and pay for the recordings , " he said .
" it probably would not be worth their while . "
artists who wanted to use part of an old recording as part of a new work would be affected , he added .
and he estimated consumers and broadcasters would pay about £ 2bn extra for music and other recordings if copyright was extended to 95 years .
the beatles back catalogue is worth many millions of pounds critics also accuse the recording industry of backing copyright extension because it is they , rather than the performers , who will benefit most .
jim killock , of the open rights group , said research had shown that an estimated 80 % of of extra money earned by copyright extension would go to recording companies , rather than artists .
" extension wo n't help incentivise creativity or aid our artists , " he added .
critics also say the extension will lead to many older songs languishing unheard in record companies ' back catalogues and unheard - a prediction record companies dispute .
they argue that copyright extension will encourage firms to digitise and release old songs - because there is money to be made from them .
an industry source told the bbc that record companies were determined to lobby for a 95-year copyright extension , arguing it would " harmonise " europe with the us .
said the source : " the ' creativity ' argument is based on ignorance .
" there is nothing to stop a creative person using an old recording as part of their work - as long as they do not release it .
" if they do want to release it - and perhaps make money from it themselves - then they need to seek permission from the originator and pay them a fair price . "

it would mean that performers , or their heirs , and their record companies would be paid every time their old recordings - which would be copyright-free under current rules - were broadcast .
there is nothing to stop a creative person using an old recording as part of their work - as long as they do not release it record industry source downloading old songs would also come at a price - with recording companies likely to get the lion 's share of any money to be made .
the rules would not be retrospective , and would apply only to songs about to slip out of copyright .
but the appetite for change is being partially driven by the prospect of huge amounts of popular material from the 1960s - such as beatles songs - becoming royalty-free over the next few years .
supporters - including dame vera and sir cliff richard - say it is unfair long-standing musicians lose rights over their own material in their lifetimes .
they say it denies them income which they honestly earned .
but critics say the new rules will " stifle creativity " and that it is the record companies , not the artists who will benefit most .
showbusiness lawyer nigel angel - who represents dame vera - said he had " nothing to add " on the reported row between his client and the bnp .
but he confirmed that other older musicians he represented were concerned at losing out on royalty income in their later years .
" some of them have no pensions and need this money , " he said .
" you are either gifted or good at business .
it 's rare to be both . "

" about 90 % of our performers earn less that £ 15,000 a year , and even a few hundred pounds extra would mean an awful lot to them . "
negotiations are ongoing about precisely how long performers ' copyright should last .
a few countries - like the netherlands - have opposed any change to current rules .
the record industry favours 95 years , but uk ministers say this period " goes beyond " what is necessary to protect performers ' interests .
the cd being sold by the bnp is also available from many other outlets intellectual property minister david lammy confirmed that performers " should be protected throughout their lifetime . "
a european parliament source confirmed that a compromise 70-year extension was currently being discussed .
opponents of copyright extension say any benefits accruing to older performers are outweighed by the " stifling of creativity " .
professor lionel bently , of cambridge university 's centre for intellectual property and information law , said extending copyright risked putting thousands of recordings - free to use under current rules - out of the reach of other artists and fans .
" for instance , it means that someone who wants to put up a website about , for example , the history of jazz will now have to seek permission and pay for the recordings , " he said .
" it probably would not be worth their while . "
artists who wanted to use part of an old recording as part of a new work would be affected , he added .
and he estimated consumers and broadcasters would pay about £ 2bn extra for music and other recordings if copyright was extended to 95 years .
the beatles back catalogue is worth many millions of pounds critics also accuse the recording industry of backing copyright extension because it is they , rather than the performers , who will benefit most .
jim killock , of the open rights group , said research had shown that an estimated 80 % of of extra money earned by copyright extension would go to recording companies , rather than artists .
" extension wo n't help incentivise creativity or aid our artists , " he added .
critics also say the extension will lead to many older songs languishing unheard in record companies ' back catalogues and unheard - a prediction record companies dispute .
they argue that copyright extension will encourage firms to digitise and release old songs - because there is money to be made from them .
an industry source told the bbc that record companies were determined to lobby for a 95-year copyright extension , arguing it would " harmonise " europe with the us .
said the source : " the ' creativity ' argument is based on ignorance .
" there is nothing to stop a creative person using an old recording as part of their work - as long as they do not release it .
" if they do want to release it - and perhaps make money from it themselves - then they need to seek permission from the originator and pay them a fair price . "

but the 91-year-old former forces ' sweetheart - who is said to be consulting her lawyers - is unlikely to win any legal battle against the bnp .

tomas ojea quintana met political prisoners in rangoon 's insein jail and government officials during his visit .
but he was not given access to either general than shwe or the detained opposition leader aung san suu kyi .
us secretary of state hillary clinton said the us was looking for new ways to move the situation forward in burma .
" the human rights situation in myanmar -lsb- burma -rsb- is still challenging .
it 's difficult to affirm that the human rights situation has improved , " mr ojea quintana told reporters in rangoon .
policy options ?
mrs clinton - who is on a regional tour of asia - said earlier this week that the us " is looking at what steps we might take that might influence the current burmese government and we 're also looking for ways that we could more effectively help the burmese people . "
the us , the eu and other countries apply political and economic sanctions against burma because of its poor human rights and democracy record .
the national league for democracy , burma 's opposition party led by ms suu kyi , this week re-asserted its belief that sanctions remain a useful tool .
" we would be pleased to propose they be revoked when one of our three pre-requisites has been met , " soe aung , spokesperson for the forum for democracy in burma , told the bbc news website .
these are the release of all political prisoners , the re-convening of parliament and a review of the constitution passed by the regime last year , or the start of a dialogue without preconditions , he said .
regional concern meanwhile , indonesian foreign minister hasan wirajuda , on a visit to australia , criticised the rights situation and the lack of democracy in burma .
his comments , reported on radio australia , come a week ahead of a summit of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , of which burma is a member .
dr wirajuda told the radio station that the international community must stay engaged with burma , arguing that pressure and sanctions had not worked .
burma 's ruling generals say they have a " roadmap to democracy " which includes elections under a new constitution , a process the opposition says is fundamentally flawed .

us secretary of state hillary clinton said the us was looking for new ways to move the situation forward in burma .

mrs clinton - who is on a regional tour of asia - said earlier this week that the us " is looking at what steps we might take that might influence the current burmese government and we 're also looking for ways that we could more effectively help the burmese people . "
the us , the eu and other countries apply political and economic sanctions against burma because of its poor human rights and democracy record .
the national league for democracy , burma 's opposition party led by ms suu kyi , this week re-asserted its belief that sanctions remain a useful tool .
" we would be pleased to propose they be revoked when one of our three pre-requisites has been met , " soe aung , spokesperson for the forum for democracy in burma , told the bbc news website .
these are the release of all political prisoners , the re-convening of parliament and a review of the constitution passed by the regime last year , or the start of a dialogue without preconditions , he said .
regional concern meanwhile , indonesian foreign minister hasan wirajuda , on a visit to australia , criticised the rights situation and the lack of democracy in burma .
his comments , reported on radio australia , come a week ahead of a summit of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- , of which burma is a member .
dr wirajuda told the radio station that the international community must stay engaged with burma , arguing that pressure and sanctions had not worked .
burma 's ruling generals say they have a " roadmap to democracy " which includes elections under a new constitution , a process the opposition says is fundamentally flawed .

ministers at the british-irish council discussed social inclusion and the economic downturn .
the council meets at least once a year and was created following the good friday agreement 12 years ago .
but some commentators have argued its role is more significant for its symbolism than for its actions .
others at the summit included scottish first minister alex salmond , the irish taoiseach , or prime minister , brian cowen , wales ' deputy first minister ieuan wyn jones , welsh secretary paul murphy - who is representing the uk government - and northern ireland deputy first minister martin mcguinness .
representatives from jersey , guernsey and the isle of man were also in attendance .
last year 's council meeting in edinburgh was hosted by mr salmond and discussed population changes and energy issues .

its creation was viewed as offering reassurance to unionists who were concerned by the extent of any ties between belfast and dublin .
" the british-irish council has been trying to carve out a role and it 's not entirely clear what that role is , " said alan trench a research fellow at the europa institute , university of edinburgh .
mr trench said major decisions were more likely to be taken in one-to-one meetings between ministers and officials , rather than at the council .
" since 1999 we have seen a preference for bilateral relations between ministers and officials , " he said .
" this is a case where the symbolism of the council is actually very important . "
themes for past conferences have been how to tackle drug abuse problems and transport issues .
the council met on friday at the swalec stadium in cardiff .

a health and safety inquiry is underway into kirsty mcrae 's 19-minute use of the salon in barry , vale of glamorgan .
swansea east mp sian james said the case was the " tip of the iceberg " of youngsters using such salons .
salon owner james hadley said he actively tried to discourage under-16s from using his shop .
kirsty , from barry island , vale of glamorgan , said she took full responsibility for using the unstaffed salon even though she was underage and there were signs saying under 16s were not allowed .
doctors kept her in hospital overnight after she suffered first degree burns , the lowest level of skin burn , after staying on a tanning machine for 19 minutes .
she admits she saw signs saying no under 16s but said : " teenagers are going to push the boundaries .
they are going to do things they should not do . "
a consultant dermatologist said it is the view of both the british association of dermatologists and the british medical association cymru wales that unstaffed tanning salons should be banned .
in 2007 , labour mp ms james put forward a commons early day motion calling for regulation of the unmanned section of the industry .
kirsty mcrae said she had never used a sun bed before she said she was " sorry but not surprised " to learn of kirsty 's experience .
she said : " we have got to protect young people from smoking , drugs and alcohol .
we also need to protect them from the use of sunbeds .
" i do n't think we should have unstaffed salons .
it 's not sufficient to stick a sign up .
" i want all salons to be staffed . "
she was supported by doctor sharon blackford , a consultant dermatologist at swansea 's singleton hospital , who said unstaffed salons should be banned and the age at which teenagers could use sunbeds should be raised from 16 to 18 .
she said : " children can get in there and are not able to appreciate the risks they are putting themselves under . "
she said the short-term risks of overusing a tanning booth was the burning demonstrated by kirsty 's experience .
' cancer risk ' " long term , though , as dermatologists , we 're even more worried about the increased risk of skin cancer these young people are exposing themselves to , " she said .
" we know that severe sunburn , especially at a young age , increases your risk of melanoma , which is the most serious form of skin cancer .
" and also the more exposure to ultra violet light you have over your lifetime , you increase your risk of other forms of skin cancer , ageing , wrinkling , becoming leathery and not very attractive as well . "
' prominent sign ' mr hadley said : " there is no actual law preventing them from using it , but i do n't want under 16s using my shop .
" so i 've actually got a prominent sign on the front door , and a sign on all my literature as well , leaflets and posters .
" when i was notified that school kids were actually pulling up in the bus and using my shop , i actively put one of my members of staff there from three to four o 'clock to try to prevent this .
" i asked them to actively id anybody who looks less 21 and prevent them from using the sun beds without , obviously , id . "
mr hadley 's father , steve , said he and his son had offered to meet kirsty and her family .
he said : " it 's an unfortunate incident .
we do feel for the girl but she should n't have gone on for that length of time .
it 's just been blown up out of all proportion . "

delhi 6 tells the tale of a boy who returns to delhi after living in new york the former miss world-turned-actress stars alongside steve martin in pink panther 2 .
meanwhile her husband abhishek - son of the legendary amitabh bachchan - is releasing his latest bollywood film called delhi 6 .
delhi 6 is inspired by the postal code of the ancient walled city in old delhi and forms the backdrop to the movie .
the story revolves around an american indian , roshan , who travels from the usa to india for the first time with his ailing grandmother .
on his recent trip to london , abhishek spoke about his wife 's movie as well as his own .
your wife is currently starring in pink panther 2 - what did you make of her performance ?
absolutely hilarious .
i was laughing my head off !
i mean it 's the pink panther - you ca n't go wrong - it 's a fantastic franchise and a great genre .
it 's something aishwarya has n't done before - she has n't done much comedy .
she was very reluctant to do the film at first and made the mistake of asking me how i felt .
i said : ' listen do n't even think about it .
you know you 've got steve martin , andy garcia , alfred molina , emily mortimer and jean reno in it .
aishwarya rai stars alongside steve martin , playing the hapless inspecteur clouseau ' they are actors we 've all grown up with and you 're getting the opportunity to work with them .
' just steve martin alone , according to me , is a complete genius so just work with him for the experience .
you 'll be richer for it . '
she said ok and she did it and she had a blast making it .
i 'm happy she did it and she 's happy she did it .
let 's talk about your film delhi 6 ...
i think especially for a lot of people here in the uk or anyone living outside india whose families are from there will associate with the film .
it 's the journey of one boy who goes back home to delhi from new york .
it 's really going to touch a chord with people who know what it feels like to spend a lot of time outside their homeland .
i 'm very proud of the film .
i saw the rough cut of the film and i 'm immensely proud .
i want to scream from the roof tops ' people go watch this film ' .
it 's a good film .
you filmed at the taj mahal , did n't you ?
there 's a scene in the film where they take me to the taj mahal .
you ca n't go to india and not see the taj mahal .
so since it 's very close to delhi - there 's a scene where we go there .
the authorities were wonderful and they gave us permission to film there .
we were shooting quietly and then came away .
in the movie you work with some of bollywood 's legends , such as waheeda rehman and rishi kapoor .
what was it like to work with the older generation ?
brilliant !
brilliant !
i think the greatest thing about them is they 're more like kids on set .
you go there thinking i 'm just going to absorb and learn from these great actors but you end up realising they 're actually observing you and learning from you .
that 's what makes them great !
it 's your second film with sonam kapoor- what was it like working with her ?
great fun !
she 's such a wonderful young actress and i wish her all the best because i think she 's done a very commendable job in the movie .
she 's someone who 's really going to leave her stamp on indian movies .
she 's great fun and a pleasure to be with on set .

delhi 6 tells the tale of a boy who returns to delhi after living in new york the former miss world-turned-actress stars alongside steve martin in pink panther 2 .
meanwhile her husband abhishek - son of the legendary amitabh bachchan - is releasing his latest bollywood film called delhi 6 .
delhi 6 is inspired by the postal code of the ancient walled city in old delhi and forms the backdrop to the movie .
the story revolves around an american indian , roshan , who travels from the usa to india for the first time with his ailing grandmother .
on his recent trip to london , abhishek spoke about his wife 's movie as well as his own .
your wife is currently starring in pink panther 2 - what did you make of her performance ?
absolutely hilarious .
i was laughing my head off !
i mean it 's the pink panther - you ca n't go wrong - it 's a fantastic franchise and a great genre .
it 's something aishwarya has n't done before - she has n't done much comedy .
she was very reluctant to do the film at first and made the mistake of asking me how i felt .
i said : ' listen do n't even think about it .
you know you 've got steve martin , andy garcia , alfred molina , emily mortimer and jean reno in it .
aishwarya rai stars alongside steve martin , playing the hapless inspecteur clouseau ' they are actors we 've all grown up with and you 're getting the opportunity to work with them .
' just steve martin alone , according to me , is a complete genius so just work with him for the experience .
you 'll be richer for it . '
she said ok and she did it and she had a blast making it .
i 'm happy she did it and she 's happy she did it .
let 's talk about your film delhi 6 ...
i think especially for a lot of people here in the uk or anyone living outside india whose families are from there will associate with the film .
it 's the journey of one boy who goes back home to delhi from new york .
it 's really going to touch a chord with people who know what it feels like to spend a lot of time outside their homeland .
i 'm very proud of the film .
i saw the rough cut of the film and i 'm immensely proud .
i want to scream from the roof tops ' people go watch this film ' .
it 's a good film .
you filmed at the taj mahal , did n't you ?
there 's a scene in the film where they take me to the taj mahal .
you ca n't go to india and not see the taj mahal .
so since it 's very close to delhi - there 's a scene where we go there .
the authorities were wonderful and they gave us permission to film there .
we were shooting quietly and then came away .
in the movie you work with some of bollywood 's legends , such as waheeda rehman and rishi kapoor .
what was it like to work with the older generation ?
brilliant !
brilliant !
i think the greatest thing about them is they 're more like kids on set .
you go there thinking i 'm just going to absorb and learn from these great actors but you end up realising they 're actually observing you and learning from you .
that 's what makes them great !
it 's your second film with sonam kapoor- what was it like working with her ?
great fun !
she 's such a wonderful young actress and i wish her all the best because i think she 's done a very commendable job in the movie .
she 's someone who 's really going to leave her stamp on indian movies .
she 's great fun and a pleasure to be with on set .
i 'm intrigued by the character named after an indian sweet - jalebi jalebi is played by divya dutta , another wonderful actor .
that 's just it - it 's a huge bouquet of wonderful characters - it 's just wonderful to be part of it .
