the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .

later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .

" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered .

while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .

he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 12.05.2009 turkish pm visits azerbaijan to try to cut through impasse with armenia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is trying to find a solution to keep the three countries happy turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is visiting azerbaijan with hopes of bringing some movement into his ally 's ongoing conflict with armenia .
but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "

the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .

the two men were arrested by italian police in november 2008 on suspicion of trying to smuggle five illegal immigrants into italy from greece .

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .
porsche debt a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piech says he 's concerned about porsche 's debt porsche owns 51 percent of vw shares .
yet the buying spree caused the luxury carmaker to rack up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.22 billion -rrb- in debt .
the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .
piech , the grandson of ferdinand porsche , told reporters that porsche " has its own financial problems to solve " before a deal can go forward .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlift veterans are heroes and will never be forgotten , said mayor klaus wowereit . on june 24 , 1948 berlin became a city of darkness and silence .
three years after the end of world war ii , a new conflict had begun – the cold war between the three western allies and the soviet union .
berlin – the former capital of nazi germany – had come to symbolize the very crossroads of the cold war .
the city was occupied by britain , france , the united states and the soviet union .
but it lay within the borders of the soviet-controlled east germany .
in 1948 us president harry s. truman led efforts to organize west germany as a separate nation .
soviet leader josef stalin responded by blockading all road , rail and river traffic into berlin , cutting off its more than two million inhabitants from food , fuel and other vital supplies .
a mission of mercy stalin wanted to starve west berliners into submission .
but instead , the allied planes , which only a few years previously had been bombing berlin , became the city 's lifeline .
at the height of the berlin airlift , more than 1,500 flights a day delivered up to 5,000 tons of cargo .
for a period of 322 days , an allied plane landed every 90 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gail halvorsen throws candy into a crowd of berliners one day in july 1948 us air force pilot colonel gail halvorsen used his time off to meet some children who had gathered at the end of the runway of berlin-tempelhof airport .
he handed out his only two sticks of chewing gum , and promised that if they did n't fight over them , he would drop off more from his plane the next time he returned .
" i talked to them for an hour , " he remembered upon his return to berlin years later .
" and throughout the time they didn ’ t lower themselves to be a beggar for something so extravagant . "
" anybody who had stood in that spot and looked into those kids ' eyes would have said : ' hey , i 've got to give you something . " '
the next day , on approach to berlin , he dropped some chocolate bars attached to a handkerchief parachute to the children waiting below .
every day after that the number of children would increase , and soon other pilots participated .
the us army command approved of the gesture and expanded it into " operation little vittles " .
when the news reached the united states , children all over the country sent in their own candy to help out , and soon major us candy companies joined in .
in the end over three tons of candy were dropped , and the aircraft were quickly named " raisin bombers " by berliners .
berlin airlift revisited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations marking the 60th anniversary were held at tempelhof airport 's airlift memorial on tuesday , halvorsen was one of about 100 airlift veterans who took part in celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the soviet blockade .
he and the other " candy men " – as they are popularly called in berlin – again dropped sweets from a vintage douglas c-3 airplane .
in a festive event berlin mayor klaus wowereit described the airlift as " a human and technological masterpiece . "
" the pilots were heroes , " he said , " who deserve our deep gratitude for an act of unprecedented solidarity with a beleaguered city . "
" their service guaranteed freedom in the western half of berlin , " he added .
wowereit also laid a wreath at a memorial at tempelhof airport dedicated to the 78 pilots who died as their planes crashed during the airlift .
" the heroes were the berliners , " said halvorsen upon his return to berlin .
" they slept in bombed-out buildings with very little heat , no light except for two hours in the middle of the night , and they said : ' we 'll never give in , we want freedom . " '
when soviet dictator josef stalin saw that the airlift was working he sent out signals to the three western allies .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 12.05.2009 turkish pm visits azerbaijan to try to cut through impasse with armenia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is trying to find a solution to keep the three countries happy turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is visiting azerbaijan with hopes of bringing some movement into his ally 's ongoing conflict with armenia .
but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .
dossier lists alleged terror attacks and guerrilla actions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle airport in paris was an alleged target a file on the suspects drawn up by investigating magistrates roberto rossi and francesca romana stated that the two men had " planned and organized terrorist attacks and guerrilla actions . "
equipped with arms and explosives , the two men had also set up a recruitment and training network for militants ready to commit suicide attacks or to fight in iraq and afghanistan , the dossier alleged .
france , britain and italy all have soldiers serving in a nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan .
the two men were arrested by italian police in november 2008 on suspicion of trying to smuggle five illegal immigrants into italy from greece .
documents found in their possession mentioned attacks in france and britain , " but as a mere possibility , without anything concrete or any immediate threat , " claudio galzerano of ucigos , a special police anti-terrorism unit , told reuters . nda / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .

in addition to arms , questionable transports include illegal drugs , diamonds and other precious minerals , according to the report .

" our research shows that companies named in arms trafficking-related reports have poor safety records .
safety regulations represent their achilles heel , " co-author mark bromley said .
the report called on un agencies , governments and ngos to make humanitarian aid and peacekeeping contracts conditional on adherence to an ethical transportation code .
swedish international development cooperation minister gunilla carlsson called the report findings " very disturbing " and said " immediate action " was needed .
carlsson said sweden would begin working to put the institute 's recommendations into place .

later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

airlift veterans are heroes and will never be forgotten , said mayor klaus wowereit . on june 24 , 1948 berlin became a city of darkness and silence .
three years after the end of world war ii , a new conflict had begun – the cold war between the three western allies and the soviet union .
berlin – the former capital of nazi germany – had come to symbolize the very crossroads of the cold war .
the city was occupied by britain , france , the united states and the soviet union .
but it lay within the borders of the soviet-controlled east germany .
in 1948 us president harry s. truman led efforts to organize west germany as a separate nation .
soviet leader josef stalin responded by blockading all road , rail and river traffic into berlin , cutting off its more than two million inhabitants from food , fuel and other vital supplies .
a mission of mercy stalin wanted to starve west berliners into submission .
but instead , the allied planes , which only a few years previously had been bombing berlin , became the city 's lifeline .
at the height of the berlin airlift , more than 1,500 flights a day delivered up to 5,000 tons of cargo .
for a period of 322 days , an allied plane landed every 90 seconds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel gail halvorsen throws candy into a crowd of berliners one day in july 1948 us air force pilot colonel gail halvorsen used his time off to meet some children who had gathered at the end of the runway of berlin-tempelhof airport .
he handed out his only two sticks of chewing gum , and promised that if they did n't fight over them , he would drop off more from his plane the next time he returned .
" i talked to them for an hour , " he remembered upon his return to berlin years later .
" and throughout the time they didn ’ t lower themselves to be a beggar for something so extravagant . "
" anybody who had stood in that spot and looked into those kids ' eyes would have said : ' hey , i 've got to give you something . " '
the next day , on approach to berlin , he dropped some chocolate bars attached to a handkerchief parachute to the children waiting below .
every day after that the number of children would increase , and soon other pilots participated .
the us army command approved of the gesture and expanded it into " operation little vittles " .
when the news reached the united states , children all over the country sent in their own candy to help out , and soon major us candy companies joined in .
in the end over three tons of candy were dropped , and the aircraft were quickly named " raisin bombers " by berliners .
berlin airlift revisited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrations marking the 60th anniversary were held at tempelhof airport 's airlift memorial on tuesday , halvorsen was one of about 100 airlift veterans who took part in celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the end of the soviet blockade .
he and the other " candy men " – as they are popularly called in berlin – again dropped sweets from a vintage douglas c-3 airplane .
in a festive event berlin mayor klaus wowereit described the airlift as " a human and technological masterpiece . "
" the pilots were heroes , " he said , " who deserve our deep gratitude for an act of unprecedented solidarity with a beleaguered city . "
" their service guaranteed freedom in the western half of berlin , " he added .
wowereit also laid a wreath at a memorial at tempelhof airport dedicated to the 78 pilots who died as their planes crashed during the airlift .
" the heroes were the berliners , " said halvorsen upon his return to berlin .
" they slept in bombed-out buildings with very little heat , no light except for two hours in the middle of the night , and they said : ' we 'll never give in , we want freedom . " '
when soviet dictator josef stalin saw that the airlift was working he sent out signals to the three western allies .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...

yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .

the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 12.05.2009 turkish pm visits azerbaijan to try to cut through impasse with armenia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is trying to find a solution to keep the three countries happy turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is visiting azerbaijan with hopes of bringing some movement into his ally 's ongoing conflict with armenia .
but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .

for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .

sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .

the two men were arrested by italian police in november 2008 on suspicion of trying to smuggle five illegal immigrants into italy from greece .

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .
dossier lists alleged terror attacks and guerrilla actions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle airport in paris was an alleged target a file on the suspects drawn up by investigating magistrates roberto rossi and francesca romana stated that the two men had " planned and organized terrorist attacks and guerrilla actions . "
equipped with arms and explosives , the two men had also set up a recruitment and training network for militants ready to commit suicide attacks or to fight in iraq and afghanistan , the dossier alleged .
france , britain and italy all have soldiers serving in a nato-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan .
the two men were arrested by italian police in november 2008 on suspicion of trying to smuggle five illegal immigrants into italy from greece .
documents found in their possession mentioned attacks in france and britain , " but as a mere possibility , without anything concrete or any immediate threat , " claudio galzerano of ucigos , a special police anti-terrorism unit , told reuters . nda / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow 's aim was to force the western powers to allow the soviet controlled regions to start supplying berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving them nominal control over the entire city .
in response , the western powers began the berlin airlift to bring supplies to the nearly two million people of berlin . the us and the british royal air force flew more than 200,000 flights that provided 13,000 tons of food daily .
these planes became known as ‘ raison bombers ’ among berliners and ‘ candy bombers ’ by americans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 12.05.2009 turkish pm visits azerbaijan to try to cut through impasse with armenia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is trying to find a solution to keep the three countries happy turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is visiting azerbaijan with hopes of bringing some movement into his ally 's ongoing conflict with armenia .
but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

moscow 's aim was to force the western powers to allow the soviet controlled regions to start supplying berlin with food and fuel , thereby giving them nominal control over the entire city .
in response , the western powers began the berlin airlift to bring supplies to the nearly two million people of berlin . the us and the british royal air force flew more than 200,000 flights that provided 13,000 tons of food daily .
these planes became known as ‘ raison bombers ’ among berliners and ‘ candy bombers ’ by americans .

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .
dossier lists alleged terror attacks and guerrilla actions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles de gaulle airport in paris was an alleged target a file on the suspects drawn up by investigating magistrates roberto rossi and francesca romana stated that the two men had " planned and organized terrorist attacks and guerrilla actions . "
equipped with arms and explosives , the two men had also set up a recruitment and training network for militants ready to commit suicide attacks or to fight in iraq and afghanistan , the dossier alleged .

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .

information on the two men , identified by police as bassam ayachi and raphael gendron , both long-time residents of belgium , was passed on to italian authorities by belgian intelligence who suspected the men of preparing an attack on france 's main international airport , ansa news agency reported .
the pair , who have spent the last six months in a prison in bari after being arrested as part of an investigation into illegal immigration trafficking , had identified paris ' roissy-charles de gaulle airport as one of their targets and they had also planned an attack in britain , the agency reported .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .
porsche debt a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piech says he 's concerned about porsche 's debt porsche owns 51 percent of vw shares .
yet the buying spree caused the luxury carmaker to rack up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.22 billion -rrb- in debt .
the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .
piech , the grandson of ferdinand porsche , told reporters that porsche " has its own financial problems to solve " before a deal can go forward .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .

sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .

yet the buying spree caused the luxury carmaker to rack up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.22 billion -rrb- in debt .
the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .
piech , the grandson of ferdinand porsche , told reporters that porsche " has its own financial problems to solve " before a deal can go forward .

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .

cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .

sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .

during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .

some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .
porsche debt a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piech says he 's concerned about porsche 's debt porsche owns 51 percent of vw shares .
yet the buying spree caused the luxury carmaker to rack up 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.22 billion -rrb- in debt .
the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .
piech , the grandson of ferdinand porsche , told reporters that porsche " has its own financial problems to solve " before a deal can go forward .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the heart of the investigation is whether porsche properly disclosed its intent to take a majority stake in vw , according to a report in the business magazine wirtschaftswoche .
if found guilty by bafin , porsche could face a hefty fine , according to the wirtschaftswoche report .
the article claims that porsche was already scheming to take a 75 percent stake in vw in february of 2008 .
yet on march 10 , 2008 , porsche vehemently denied that it was pursuing such a course .
the company did n't report its intentions until october of 2008 .
financial securities law requires major decisions on investments to be announced immediately after they are made .
in the meantime , porsche 's buying spree caused the price of vw shares to surge .
that forced speculators who had sold the stock short or borrowed it to buy whatever shares were available at vastly inflated prices .
some hedge funds and banks lost a lot of money on the shares .
porsche has denied it did anything wrong .

the high level of debt caused porsche to look at merging with volkswagen , instead of taking it over .
but vw is in no rush for the merger to go forward , vw chairman ferdinand piech said on tuesday .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 12.05.2009 turkish pm visits azerbaijan to try to cut through impasse with armenia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan is trying to find a solution to keep the three countries happy turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan is visiting azerbaijan with hopes of bringing some movement into his ally 's ongoing conflict with armenia .
but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .

the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday he was flown to munich and brought to a prison awaiting trial .
cornelia rabitz has this commentary . sobibor was a nazi concentration camp in occupied poland ; a death camp with the sole purpose of murdering jews .
each day , up to 2,000 people died in the gas chambers .
it 's estimated that in total around 250,000 were killed at sobibor .
the camp 's guards forced the victims out of the trains , from the platform on into the gas chambers .
they operated the chambers and let the lethal carbon monoxide into what looked like harmless shower rooms .
afterwards , they dumped the bodies into mass graves , and prepared the chambers for the next group of victims .
one of those accomplices was the ukrainian ivan " john " demjanjuk .
he stands accused of having been being accessory to the murder of at least 29,000 jews between march and september 1943 .
documents show that - together with fellow guards - he was trained for these deadly tasks in an ss camp .
before that , he had been a prisoner of war .
it is possible that he offered his services to the ss out of fear for his own safety .
but this does not diminish his guilt .
demjanjuk dismisses the accusations .
he claims he knew nothing of what happened at sobibor - or later on majdanek and flossenbuerg .
he says he is being confused with a cousin with the same name .
he insists that he himself was merely a prisoner of war .
but the evidence is overwhelmingly against him .
demjanjuk probably was only a henchman , a cog in the machinery of murder .
there certainly have been bigger nazi criminals and many of them never were brought to justice .
this was a failure of the german justice system .
the munich trial is likely to be the last big nazi trial in germany .
demajanjuk is 89 - an old , possibly very ill man who fails to see the error of his ways and demands mercy before even having been found guilty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horror remains with the survivors all their lives - and as does the guilt with those responsible john demjanjuk is to be put on trial in accordance with the rule of law . the trial is expected to take in account the old age and the poor health of the accused .
there 's no doubt that it will be a long and difficult trial , one with an uncertain outcome .
the challenge will be to prove demjanjuk 's individual guilt .
and it 's far from clear whether or not he will one day serve a sentence in a german prison .
but does that mean that this trial will be pointless ?
certainly not .
there 's more at stake here than merely the principle that murder is not subject to the statute of limitations .
the german judiciary is making the point that no one is immune from justice - even more than six decades after the defeat of the nazi regime .
old-age is by no means a reason to be spared justice .
the munich trial is also a signal of condemnation of barbarism and inhumanity .
but even more important is the signal that the trial is sending to the surviving victims and their families .
it 's a commitment to truth , justice and human dignity regardless of whether or not demjanjuk is eventually sentenced .
the victims have to live with the horror and trauma for the rest of their lives .
and the guilt of those responsible for that does not end when they reach the age of retirement . author : cornelia rabitz editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" financial holding companies or credit institutes or subsidiary companies will have the possibility to transfer structured products to special purpose vehicles at a discount to their book-value , " the draft said .
according to finance minister peer steinbrueck the banks will continue to be held responsible for the toxic assets and the costs of the transfer and holding of the assets will be borne by the banks " in the long run . "
the plan is being presented to all party groups in the bundestag on tuesday and will be debated by germany 's cabinet for approval on wednesday .
berlin 's bid to rid its banks of these bad debts follows similar plans in other countries , notably britain , ireland and the united states .
the issue of how to remove " toxic assets " from banks ' balance sheets has become a particularly thorny political topic in germany , with only five months until the country goes to the polls in a general election .
plan could solve government 's toxic dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck and his colleagues have been struggling with the bank question politicians have been torn between the urgent economic need to revive germany 's troubled banking sector and the political desire not to saddle taxpaying voters with a huge bank bailout bill .
the issue is pressing .
german banks reportedly have as much as 853 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.2 trillion -rrb- of toxic assets on their books that are either worthless or can not be sold easily in the current difficult market climate .
weighed down by these soured assets , banks have become reluctant to lend money to consumers and businesses , depressing the german economy , which the government says could contract by 6 percent this year . nda / ncy / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish leaders hailed john demjanjuk 's deportation , saying they hoped it was n't too late for the 89-year-old to be brought to justice . the suspected war criminal arrived in munich on tuesday morning after being put on a charter flight in cleveland , ohio . german prosecutors accuse demjanjuk of at least 29,000 counts of accessory to murder dating back to 1943 when he worked as prison guard at the sobibor concentration camp in nazi-occupied poland .
upon arrival in germany , demjanjuk was taken to stadelheim prison .
if no new evidence surfaces , he will be formally charged " within weeks , " the prosecution said .
" now , finally , mr. demjanjuk has been held accountable in one small way for his part in one of the most horrific chapters in history , " us assistant attorney general lanny breuer said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was sent to germany monday evening demjanjuk has consistently protested his innocence , claiming he was a red army soldier , who was captured by the germans and held in a prison camp until the end of the war .
jewish leaders want justice charlotte knobloch , president of the central council of jews in germany , said she hoped that demjanjuk 's trial would begin as quickly as possible . " it is not about revenge , but about justice , " she said .
" all living nazi war criminals should know that there can be no mercy for them , regardless of their age .
they must be held responsible for their inhuman actions . " demjanjuk tops the simon wiesenthal center 's list of the 10 most-wanted suspected war criminals .
the wiesenthal center says demjanjuk pushed men , women and children into gas chambers . despite his age , he " deserves to be punished for the unspeakable crimes he committed , " rabbi marvin hier of the center said . appeal process exhausted on thursday , the us supreme court refused to hear demjanjuk 's appeal , clearing the way for his deportation and putting an end to nearly three decades of legal wrangling .
us investigators have collected witness testimony describing his activities at the camp .
but for german prosecutors , the key to trying demjanjuk will be establishing that he is physically and mentally able to withstand the travails of a trial .
demjanjuk suffers from various physical ailments and had claimed that he was not fit to travel .
us nazi hunters , however , videotaped him walking to his car unaided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk was filmed walking unaided after claiming he was too ill to travel ukrainian-born demjanjuk allegedly worked as a prison guard at sobibor from march to september 1943 .
after world war ii , he spent a brief period of time in bavaria as a refugee .
he changed his name from ivan to john and in 1952 moved to the united states , where he lived an innocuous life as an auto mechanic in cleveland , ohio .
after witnesses identified him as the notorious camp guard nicknamed " ivan the terrible " he was deported to israel in 1986 and sentenced to death in 1988 .
his sentence was overturned by the israeli supreme court in 1993 when another man was identified as " ivan the terrible . " th / pfd / reuters / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but jewish leaders in germany and israel criticized the pope for not going far enough . the 82-year-old pontiff moves on to jewish and muslim holy sites at the heart of the middle east conflict on tuesday as his middle east visit continues , but debate and criticism over his speech at his first port of call remains loud . on monday , the pontiff prayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where he said the suffering of holocaust victims should never be forgotten , denied or belittled , adding that the nazi murder of six million jews was a " horrific tragedy . " but his speech at the memorial left many unimpressed . charlotte knobloch , the president of the central council of jews in germany , told germany 's bild newspaper that , while the pope ’ s call to fight anti-semitism gave “ a positive signal , ” his overall speech was “ half-hearted . ” knobloch said that the pope could have used the visit and the speech to state the vatican ’ s clear dissociation with the anti-semitic pius brotherhood , a radical sect of ultra-conservative catholic priests . speech lacked clear vatican stance , says knobloch she added that the council had hoped for “ clear words from the pope ” on the stance of the holy see against holocaust deniers and anti-semites associated with the catholic church .
while disappointed that the pope did not make a stand , knobloch said the council was still hopeful that the vatican ’ s position would be made clear “ as soon as possible . ” benedict came in for fierce criticism , not just from jews , for his decision in january this year to rescind the excommunication of holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson , a member of the pius brotherhood . meanwhile , in jerusalem , the chairman of the yad vashem council , rabbi meir lau , said that while the speech was " moving , " it lacked " an expression of empathy with the sorrow . " bildunterschrift : some say the pope 's speech lacked certain elements " something was missing .
there was no mention of the germans or the nazis who participated in the butchery , nor a word of regret , " ha 'aretz newspaper quoted lau , a holocaust survivor , as saying .
" there certainly was no apology expressed here . " avner schalev , a memorial center official , told journalists that the papal visit was " important and positive , " describing the speech as a step forward .
but he added he had expected more condemnation of the holocaust .
schalev said that the pope could have been more " personal " in his yad vashem speech and referred to the perpetrators by name . pope calls for continued remembrance the pope told those gathered at the yad vashem holocaust memorial center that the names of the victims and the suffering they endured , should always be remembered . " may their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " the german-born pontiff said , as he stood , somber-faced , in the center 's granite hall of remembrance , where the names of the nazi extermination centers are inscribed on the floor and a memorial flame burns continually . " may the names of these victims never perish . ...
and may all people of goodwill remain vigilant in rooting out from the heart of man anything that could lead to tragedies such as this , " he remarked . he honored the " millions of jews killed in this horrific tragedy " saying , they may have " lost their lives , but they will never lose their names . " bildunterschrift : jewish leaders wanted more from the pope " one can rob a neighbor of possessions , opportunity or freedom .
one can weave an insidious web of lies to convince others that certain groups are undeserving of respect .
yet , try as one might , one can never take away the name of a fellow human being , " the pope said . " as we stand here in silence , their cry still echoes in our hearts .
it is a cry raised against every act of injustice and violence .
it is a perpetual reproach against the spilling of innocent blood , " he said . prior to his remarks , the pope laid a wreath at the memorial flame , and stood motionless for several seconds , head bowed in silent contemplation . pontiff continues with tour , despite criticism the pope will try and leave controversy behind as he continues with his tour of the middle east by celebrating mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron and holding talks with jewish and muslim religious leaders as well as representatives of the various catholic rites in the holy city on the second day of his five-day visit to israel and the occupied west bank . benedict will become the first pope to enter the dome of the rock on al-haram al-sharif -lrb- the noble sanctuary -rrb- , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third holiest spot . the site , which the jews call temple mount , is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 . pope john paul ii had visited the compound during his landmark 2000 pilgrimage to the holy land , but did not enter the dome of the rock , whose huge golden cupola is seen as jerusalem 's main landmark . benedict will meet the mufti of jerusalem at the mosque compound , before heading to the western wall which it overlooks . also known as the wailing wall , the sacred site is the top pilgrimage destination for the world 's jews . he will then hold talks with the two chief rabbis of israel . in the afternoon , the pope will celebrate mass in jerusalem 's valley of kidron , between the mount of olives and the walls of the old city .
many christians believe this is the biblical valley of jehoshaphat where god will sit in divine judgement at the end of time . benedict will also meet representatives of the various catholic rites , which include melkites , maronites , chaldeans , armenians and syrians . nda / nrt / ncy / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but all of the parties concerned have major conflicts of interest . the main goal for erdogan in his talks with azerbaijani president ilham aliyev is to reassure baku that turkey 's current policy of rapprochement with armenia will not harm relations between the two allies .
turkey has always supported azerbaijan in the conflict over nagorny-karabakh , a majority armenian area of azerbaijan that 's under armenian control .
at the same time , turkey hopes improving its relations with armenia will bolster its chances for eu membership .
experts say ankara is stuck between a rock and a hard place .
" turkey is pursuing a policy of unproblematic relations with its neighbors and would like to open its border with armenia , something supported by the armenian public , " uwe hallbach - a caucasus expert for the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin - told dw-world.de.
" but the nagorny-karabakh conflict is a major sticking point . "
jan senkyr , the representative of germany 's konrad adenauer foundation in turkey , concurs . " aside from the policy of getting on with its neighbors , turkey would like more influence in the caucasus , would benefit economically from opening the border with armenia and would better its image with both the us and the eu , " senkyr told dw-world.de. solidarity and animosity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nagorny-karabakh has been the object of conflict for two decades turkey closed its border with armenia in 1993 after armenian troops entered nagorny-karabakh .
that act was an expression of solidarity with azerbaijan , with which turkey shares a number of linguistic , cultural and historical commonalities .
and baku expects turkey 's continuing unconditional support on the issue .
" azerbaijan thinks it 's turkey 's duty to keep the border closed until the nagorny-karabakh conflict is resolved , " hallbach said .
" that 's why baku views the thaw between turkey and armenia with such mistrust .
it would be a great boon if that issue were uncoupled from other questions . "
for armenians , hallbach said , the importance of nagorny-karabakh outweighs even the resentment about what many consider the genocide of armenians by turkey in world war i. however , most armenians would likely support a de-escalation of the nagorny-karabakh conflict , if azerbaijan were willing to make concessions of its own .
baku , which views the region as an unequivocal part of its sovereign territory , has not thus far proven amenable to compromise .
" turkey has to walk a diplomatic tight-rope , " senkyr said .
" that 's why erdogan has gone to baku - to smooth things over . " pipeline problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nabucco is an international project that would directly link azerbaijan and the eu the situation is further complicated by the fact that azerbaijan is one of the countries expected to supply natural gas to the planned nabucco pipeline , which would connect turkey and western europe .
the project is one of turkey 's main economic focuses for the future , but baku has intimated that azerbaijan could create problems , if it feels betrayed by turkish attempts to reconcile with armenia .
experts think such intimations are probably a bluff .
" azerbaijan has threatened to revise its pipeline policies , but you have to question whether that is meant seriously , " hallbach said .
" such a move would actually be directly contrary to their interests . "
" nothing has happened yet , " senkyr concurred .
" it 's probably an expression of disappointment , and the future will depend on how turkey acts in its negotiations with armenia . "
does moscow hold the key ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politics of gas could be at odds with the desire for stability on saturday , erdogan is to call on russian prime minister vladimir putin .
the situation in the caucasus , where russia has enormous influence , will likely be one of the topics for the two leaders .
russia , say regional specialists , could be the ideal mediator to break the many conflicts of interest dividing turkey , azerbaijan and armenia at the moment .
" especially compared with the situation surrounding georgia , russia is relatively neutral concerning nagorny-karabakh , " hallbach told dw-world.de.
" it could indeed put pressure on armenia to withdraw its troops . "
senkyr agrees that russia is interested in bringing stability to the volatile caucasus but said other interests could come into play .
" from an energy standpoint , russia has no desire to see azerbaijan so closely tied to the eu , " senkyr said .
no one expects a breakthrough to come any time in the immediate future .
erdogan would likely be satisfied if his two-day visit to azerbaijan and upcoming trip to russia bring some small steps toward a lasting solution .

the pope continues to face criticism on the second day of a week-long visit to the region . police cordoned off the walled old city of jerusalem on tuesday as the pope made his way to an elevated stone platform known to muslims as the holy sanctuary and to jews as the temple mount .
benedict became the first pope to enter the dome of the rock shrine , also known as the al-aqsa mosque compound , which is islam 's third-holiest site . it is also the holiest in judaism and has been a major flashpoint in the israeli-palestinian conflict , where the latest palestinian uprising erupted in 2000 .
the sacred spot should encourage people to “ work to overcome misunderstandings and conflicts of the past , ” he said , according to a vatican transcript .
" here the path of the world 's three great monotheistic religions meet , reminding us what they share , " benedict said .
pope talks of conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict visited a mosque built on a site sacred to jews and muslims the pope then moved onto the wailing wall , the only standing remnant of the jewish temple complex , where he prayed for several minutes and placed a prayer in its cracks , asking for peace in the middle east .
sheikh mohammed hussein , the grand mufti of jerusalem , said he felt the pope had been “ receptive ” when he raised the issue of the suffering of the palestinian people .
later in the day , benedict met with catholic officials and conducted a late-afternoon mass for several thousand pilgrims at the garden of gethsemane .
" i wish to acknowledge the difficulties , the frustration , and the pain and suffering , which so many of you have endured as a result of the conflicts which have afflicted these lands , and the bitter experiences of displacement which so many of your families have known and god forbid may yet know , " the pontiff said in his homily .
criticism over speech continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the pope lacked compassion when speaking of the holocaust benedict 's trip to israel is aimed in part at boosting bilateral ties .
during a meeting with israel 's two chief rabbis on tuesday , the pontiff reiterated that the catholic church was committed to reconciliation with jews .
yet criticism kept reverberating from a speech benedict had made on monday at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial center .
some israeli officials and other critics thought the speech did not go far enough in condemning the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed .
tel aviv chief rabbi yisrael meir lau , chairman of the yad vashem council and himself a holocaust survivor , was among those who criticized the speech , saying it was devoid of " any compassion , any regret , any pain over the horrible tragedy of the six million victims .

it says its undercover work has helped send wholesale prices soaring .
prices per kilo have risen from £ 39,000 in 2008 to over £ 45,000 -lrb- 50,000 euros -rrb- , but street prices have remained stable .
however , new figures obtained by the bbc suggest almost a third of police seizures are now less than 9 % pure , the lowest recorded purity level .
the data , collected by the forensic science service , reveals how drug gangs are using increasing amounts of chemicals - so-called cutting agents - to dilute cocaine powder sold on the streets of britain .
they include the cancer-causing drug phenacetin , cockroach insecticide and pet worming powder . "
what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure " martin barnes drugscope chemicals mixed with cocaine new tactic in war on gangs soca head of enforcement trevor pearce told the bbc : " there is a discernible effect that we are now seeing in relation to the availability of cocaine both in europe and also across the uk .
" we are now seeing high-quality cocaine at about £ 45,000 -lrb- 50,000 euros -rrb- per kilo wholesale in the uk .
that 's significantly higher than it has been and has to be indicative of the pressure which the importers are under . "
soca has released its internal estimates of wholesale cocaine prices .
two years ago , the highest quality blocks typically cost £ 35,000 -lrb- 38,946 euros -rrb- .
by the end of last year , the price had risen to £ 39,000 -lrb- 43,393 euros -rrb- .
but in the first few months of this year the price , according to soca , has hit a record level ; more than £ 45,000 per kilo .
soca accepts that the rise in the price of wholesale cocaine measured in sterling may in part be a consequence of the weakness of the pound .
but it argues that a similar price rise " across europe " suggest the increases can be attributed to more than fluctuations in the money markets .
" we are seeing wholesale prices of cocaine rising across europe , in spain and belgium .
we think that is due to a large degree to the strategy of working in south america , the caribbean , across the atlantic and with european partners - tackling it in a different way , " mr pearce said .
soca - which has been under pressure to prove its effectiveness - claims its activities in the run-up to christmas stopped 10 tonnes of street-quality cocaine powder being sold in britain .
but analysts at drugscope say the shortage of supply has not seen a fall in street prices although purity levels have dropped .
" at the moment price is relatively stable for cocaine , " says drugscope director martin barnes .
" what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure and a lot of people buying it probably do n't realise that 's what 's going on . "
the latest figures from the forensic science service reveal how average purity of police seizures of cocaine has fallen to its lowest ever recorded level - less than 20 % pure on average .
almost a third -lrb- 31 % -rrb- of seizures are below 9 % pure .
joy newman , a scientist with the fss , says there has been a significant decrease in the quality of the wraps of cocaine powder examined at the laboratory .
" purities now are quite low - between 5 % and 40 % in police seizures and we have seen them as low as 4 % or 5 % in the last few weeks . "
since last october , every seizure of cocaine is tested for impurities as part of a new soca initiative codenamed project endorse .
a searchable database has been constructed which has identified links between more than 170 seizures that would otherwise not have been connected .
cutting agents the agency is also targeting importers of chemicals used as cutting agents , and has sent warning letters to some suppliers who they suspect may be selling the products to drug gangs . "
soca may have decided that , whatever you do on the war on drugs , you can not win the vital public relations battle by operating from the shadows " mark easton 's blog in the last year there have been 72 " law enforcement operations " involving cutting agents , even though the chemicals themselves are legal .
critics of soca suggest trying to limit the supplies of illegal drugs is an unsustainable tactic .
martin barnes from drugscope argues that while something very significant is happening to the cocaine market , " enforcement methods have a limited impact in terms of the availability of drugs and the key is to tackle the demand side " .
trevor pearce from soca accepts that the drug gangs are likely to change their tactics .
" one of the things we have to do is to try to anticipate where the organised criminals are going to next , so we can stay a step ahead of them , " he said .

two years ago , the highest quality blocks typically cost £ 35,000 -lrb- 38,946 euros -rrb- .
by the end of last year , the price had risen to £ 39,000 -lrb- 43,393 euros -rrb- .
but in the first few months of this year the price , according to soca , has hit a record level ; more than £ 45,000 per kilo .
soca accepts that the rise in the price of wholesale cocaine measured in sterling may in part be a consequence of the weakness of the pound .
but it argues that a similar price rise " across europe " suggest the increases can be attributed to more than fluctuations in the money markets .
" we are seeing wholesale prices of cocaine rising across europe , in spain and belgium .
we think that is due to a large degree to the strategy of working in south america , the caribbean , across the atlantic and with european partners - tackling it in a different way , " mr pearce said .
soca - which has been under pressure to prove its effectiveness - claims its activities in the run-up to christmas stopped 10 tonnes of street-quality cocaine powder being sold in britain .
but analysts at drugscope say the shortage of supply has not seen a fall in street prices although purity levels have dropped .
" at the moment price is relatively stable for cocaine , " says drugscope director martin barnes .
" what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure and a lot of people buying it probably do n't realise that 's what 's going on . "
the latest figures from the forensic science service reveal how average purity of police seizures of cocaine has fallen to its lowest ever recorded level - less than 20 % pure on average .
almost a third -lrb- 31 % -rrb- of seizures are below 9 % pure .
joy newman , a scientist with the fss , says there has been a significant decrease in the quality of the wraps of cocaine powder examined at the laboratory .
" purities now are quite low - between 5 % and 40 % in police seizures and we have seen them as low as 4 % or 5 % in the last few weeks . "
since last october , every seizure of cocaine is tested for impurities as part of a new soca initiative codenamed project endorse .
a searchable database has been constructed which has identified links between more than 170 seizures that would otherwise not have been connected .
cutting agents the agency is also targeting importers of chemicals used as cutting agents , and has sent warning letters to some suppliers who they suspect may be selling the products to drug gangs .
soca may have decided that , whatever you do on the war on drugs , you can not win the vital public relations battle by operating from the shadows mark easton 's blog in the last year there have been 72 " law enforcement operations " involving cutting agents , even though the chemicals themselves are legal .
critics of soca suggest trying to limit the supplies of illegal drugs is an unsustainable tactic .
martin barnes from drugscope argues that while something very significant is happening to the cocaine market , " enforcement methods have a limited impact in terms of the availability of drugs and the key is to tackle the demand side " .
trevor pearce from soca accepts that the drug gangs are likely to change their tactics .
" one of the things we have to do is to try to anticipate where the organised criminals are going to next , so we can stay a step ahead of them , " he said .

but analysts at drugscope say the shortage of supply has not seen a fall in street prices although purity levels have dropped .
" at the moment price is relatively stable for cocaine , " says drugscope director martin barnes .
" what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure and a lot of people buying it probably do n't realise that 's what 's going on . "
the latest figures from the forensic science service reveal how average purity of police seizures of cocaine has fallen to its lowest ever recorded level - less than 20 % pure on average .
almost a third -lrb- 31 % -rrb- of seizures are below 9 % pure .
joy newman , a scientist with the fss , says there has been a significant decrease in the quality of the wraps of cocaine powder examined at the laboratory .
" purities now are quite low - between 5 % and 40 % in police seizures and we have seen them as low as 4 % or 5 % in the last few weeks . "
since last october , every seizure of cocaine is tested for impurities as part of a new soca initiative codenamed project endorse .
a searchable database has been constructed which has identified links between more than 170 seizures that would otherwise not have been connected .
cutting agents the agency is also targeting importers of chemicals used as cutting agents , and has sent warning letters to some suppliers who they suspect may be selling the products to drug gangs .
soca may have decided that , whatever you do on the war on drugs , you can not win the vital public relations battle by operating from the shadows mark easton 's blog in the last year there have been 72 " law enforcement operations " involving cutting agents , even though the chemicals themselves are legal .
critics of soca suggest trying to limit the supplies of illegal drugs is an unsustainable tactic .
martin barnes from drugscope argues that while something very significant is happening to the cocaine market , " enforcement methods have a limited impact in terms of the availability of drugs and the key is to tackle the demand side " .

prices per kilo have risen from £ 39,000 in 2008 to over £ 45,000 -lrb- 50,000 euros -rrb- , but street prices have remained stable .
however , new figures obtained by the bbc suggest almost a third of police seizures are now less than 9 % pure , the lowest recorded purity level .
the data , collected by the forensic science service , reveals how drug gangs are using increasing amounts of chemicals - so-called cutting agents - to dilute cocaine powder sold on the streets of britain .
they include the cancer-causing drug phenacetin , cockroach insecticide and pet worming powder .
what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure martin barnes drugscope chemicals mixed with cocaine new tactic in war on gangs soca head of enforcement trevor pearce told the bbc : " there is a discernible effect that we are now seeing in relation to the availability of cocaine both in europe and also across the uk .
" we are now seeing high-quality cocaine at about £ 45,000 -lrb- 50,000 euros -rrb- per kilo wholesale in the uk .
that 's significantly higher than it has been and has to be indicative of the pressure which the importers are under . "
soca has released its internal estimates of wholesale cocaine prices .
two years ago , the highest quality blocks typically cost £ 35,000 -lrb- 38,946 euros -rrb- .
by the end of last year , the price had risen to £ 39,000 -lrb- 43,393 euros -rrb- .
but in the first few months of this year the price , according to soca , has hit a record level ; more than £ 45,000 per kilo .
soca accepts that the rise in the price of wholesale cocaine measured in sterling may in part be a consequence of the weakness of the pound .
but it argues that a similar price rise " across europe " suggest the increases can be attributed to more than fluctuations in the money markets .
" we are seeing wholesale prices of cocaine rising across europe , in spain and belgium .
we think that is due to a large degree to the strategy of working in south america , the caribbean , across the atlantic and with european partners - tackling it in a different way , " mr pearce said .
soca - which has been under pressure to prove its effectiveness - claims its activities in the run-up to christmas stopped 10 tonnes of street-quality cocaine powder being sold in britain .
but analysts at drugscope say the shortage of supply has not seen a fall in street prices although purity levels have dropped .
" at the moment price is relatively stable for cocaine , " says drugscope director martin barnes .
" what is happening is that dealers are maximising their profits by selling a product that is potentially more harmful and much less pure and a lot of people buying it probably do n't realise that 's what 's going on . "
the latest figures from the forensic science service reveal how average purity of police seizures of cocaine has fallen to its lowest ever recorded level - less than 20 % pure on average .
almost a third -lrb- 31 % -rrb- of seizures are below 9 % pure .
joy newman , a scientist with the fss , says there has been a significant decrease in the quality of the wraps of cocaine powder examined at the laboratory .
" purities now are quite low - between 5 % and 40 % in police seizures and we have seen them as low as 4 % or 5 % in the last few weeks . "

officials have said that there is an overpopulation of kangaroos , and that they are damaging the environment .
but campaigners say the killings are a " brutal and unsubstantiated slaughter " .
earlier this week several protesters broke into the majura army base near canberra , in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the beginning of the cull .
they 've promised more direct action should the legal challenge fail , and they 're applying to a civil tribunal to have the cull stopped .
overgrazing nikki sutterby , from the australian society for kangaroos , says the military has provided no compelling reason why so many animals need to be shot .
" they have commenced a slaughter and they are alleged to have killed around 2,000 kangaroos within about four days , " she told the bbc .
" this is being done without any scientific proof or research to back it up . "

officials have said that there is an overpopulation of kangaroos , and that they are damaging the environment .
but campaigners say the killings are a " brutal and unsubstantiated slaughter " .

they 've promised more direct action should the legal challenge fail , and they 're applying to a civil tribunal to have the cull stopped .

" they have commenced a slaughter and they are alleged to have killed around 2,000 kangaroos within about four days , " she told the bbc .
" this is being done without any scientific proof or research to back it up . "
she said the animals would have suffered badly , claiming that joeys would have been separated from their mothers , and family groups would have been destroyed .
