in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .
silver lining however , koehler also forecasted that the crisis could have a positive side as well .
he said this included a more cooperative atmosphere in companies , an increase in volunteer work , and more innovation .
he also said that the crisis could also benefit the environment , as companies become more energy-efficient in an attempt to reduce costs .
repeat of 2004 candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd presidential candidate gesine schwan is running for the second time a former leader in the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , koehler is backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in the up-coming election . the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who currently share power with the cdu have put forward their own candidate , gesine schwan .
schwan - who also ran against koehler in 2004 - is actively campaigning for the largely ceremonial office , which is normally expected to be above partisan party politics .
she recently said she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .

nato forced to release pirates just hours before , a portuguese warship thwarted an attempt by heavily-armed pirates to take control of a norwegian tanker off the coast of somalia .
nato officials said the portuguese warship corte-real captured , disarmed and briefly detained 19 pirates after they attempted to attack the norwegian-owned oil tanker kition in the gulf of aden late on friday .

the nurse in regensburg in bavaria , who has not been to mexico recently , has now recovered , the health ministry said .
germany 's other three confirmed cases are in people who had recently returned from mexico .
another case is still unconfirmed in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg hacker is expecting further transmissions in germany " this is the first time that an infection has occurred within germany , " said joerg hacker , head of the robert-koch-institute , the country 's disease control and prevention agency in berlin .
hacker said a team of experts from the robert-koch-institute had been dispatched to bavaria .
he added that they would help in preventing a potential spread of the virus and try and gather more detailed information on it .
" the new case shows that further transmissions must be reckoned with in germany , " hacker said .
" we are prepared for the situation and this new development does n't change our strategy . "
germany is the second european nation to report a transmission within its borders .
spain 's 13 confirmed cases also include one person who had not recently traveled to mexico , but contracted the disease from his girlfriend , who had visited the country .
domestic transmissions have also occurred in the united states and mexico , according to hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel says germany is prepared to deal with an epidemic " the virus has the potency to spread and it has the potential to change genetically and that 's why we remain concerned and watchful , " hacker said .
" germany is well armed " chancellor angela merkel has said germany is prepared if the virus does spread . merkel told the newspaper , neuen presse , that " germany is well-armed to counteract an epidemic , if that occurs . " we have all the requirements to quickly deal with the situation if it intensifies .
our next step is to speak with all the states , to determine whether we have sufficient stocks of the anti-viral medication , " she said .
more cases surface in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has been hit hardest by the new flu strain france has become the latest european country to confirm cases of the h1n1 flu virus .
the french health ministry said a 49-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman , both recently returned from mexico , had been hospitalised in paris . denmark has also confirmed one case of the virus in a young woman .
cases have also been confirmed in britain , spain , austria , switzerland and the netherlands .
the european centre for disease prevention and control says that the european cases are " almost entirely among those returning from mexico . "
the only fatality outside mexico has been in the united states .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico although mexico appears to be the epicenter of the virus , eu health ministers have rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu health ministers have rejected a travel ban to mexico " in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said following an emergency meeting of eu health ministers in luxembourg on thursday .
however , she added that the plan may be revisited in the future .
other countries , such as germany and spain , have balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , since the outbreak has already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems . kj / cg / nk / rm / ca / ipj , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nurse in regensburg in bavaria , who has not been to mexico recently , has now recovered , the health ministry said .
germany 's other three confirmed cases are in people who had recently returned from mexico .
another case is still unconfirmed in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg hacker is expecting further transmissions in germany " this is the first time that an infection has occurred within germany , " said joerg hacker , head of the robert-koch-institute , the country 's disease control and prevention agency in berlin .
hacker said a team of experts from the robert-koch-institute had been dispatched to bavaria .
he added that they would help in preventing a potential spread of the virus and try and gather more detailed information on it .
" the new case shows that further transmissions must be reckoned with in germany , " hacker said .
" we are prepared for the situation and this new development does n't change our strategy . "
germany is the second european nation to report a transmission within its borders .
spain 's 13 confirmed cases also include one person who had not recently traveled to mexico , but contracted the disease from his girlfriend , who had visited the country .
domestic transmissions have also occurred in the united states and mexico , according to hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel says germany is prepared to deal with an epidemic " the virus has the potency to spread and it has the potential to change genetically and that 's why we remain concerned and watchful , " hacker said .
" germany is well armed " chancellor angela merkel has said germany is prepared if the virus does spread . merkel told the newspaper , neuen presse , that " germany is well-armed to counteract an epidemic , if that occurs . " we have all the requirements to quickly deal with the situation if it intensifies .
our next step is to speak with all the states , to determine whether we have sufficient stocks of the anti-viral medication , " she said .
more cases surface in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has been hit hardest by the new flu strain france has become the latest european country to confirm cases of the h1n1 flu virus .

cases have also been confirmed in britain , spain , austria , switzerland and the netherlands .
the european centre for disease prevention and control says that the european cases are " almost entirely among those returning from mexico . "
the only fatality outside mexico has been in the united states .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico although mexico appears to be the epicenter of the virus , eu health ministers have rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu health ministers have rejected a travel ban to mexico " in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said following an emergency meeting of eu health ministers in luxembourg on thursday .
however , she added that the plan may be revisited in the future .
other countries , such as germany and spain , have balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , since the outbreak has already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems . kj / cg / nk / rm / ca / ipj , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's entry will have on-stage support from burlesque beauty dita von teese . the american performer will apply her feminine touch to the " miss kiss kiss bang " song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .

" leading the table the players were a bit nervous and they did not do as well as i would have liked them to .
" but in the second half we were as good as we can be and i now think that we are favourites for the title .
we still have two matches at home and we just want to win as many games as we can . "

in munich , bayern took the lead in the 33rd minute through bastian schweinsteiger , but just five minutes later the visitors drew level when filip daems converted a penalty .

the coach , who will only be in charge of the side for the remainder of the season , said that his side did not do well in the second half .

they remain third in the table on 55 points .
in other matches schalke 's hopes of qualifying for the europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen , while karlsruhe missed out on an opportunity of improving their chances of avoiding relegation , as they were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers energie cottbus .

attacks on police accompanied a protest of 5,000 leftists in the central berlin district of kreuzberg .
a police spokesman said there were injuries on both sides .
far-left demonstrators had also fought running battles with police in berlin and hamburg on the night leading into may 1 , known as walpurgisnacht , setting fire to cars and rubbish bins and throwing stones at traffic .
" on the one hand there are people out in the streets protesting peacefully against the economic crisis and there 's nothing at all wrong with that , " police spokesman frank miller told n-tv television from the scene of a riot in the eastern berlin district of friedrichshain .
" but when people burn cars and trash containers and commit other criminal acts - that has nothing to do with political protests , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dgb head michael sommer said people were right to be angry about the economic crisis on friday police also counted 1,800 demonstrators in another leftist crowd which hurled paint at the german finance ministry building in berlin , leaving 60 blotches on the facade .
in the western city of dortmund , some 200 far-right extremists armed with sticks and stones attacked a daytime rally organized by trade unions .
they also fought with police , who dispersed the attackers with truncheons and took 150 people into custody .
left vs right friday saw thousands of germans take part in nationwide demonstrations against planned far-right marches .

further west , in mainz , about 600 demonstrators blocked the streets and managed to force the cancellation of a far-right march through the city centre .
mounted police units used water cannons and tear-gas to separate some 2,000 leftist radicals from neo-nazis in the southern city of ulm .
some 100 members of the far-right carried out an unauthorised march through the northern town of rotenburg , near bremen , knocking to the ground and kicking a police officer who tried to block their way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounted police were deployed to disperse protests in ulm other small neo-nazi demonstrations attracted around 100 people in the eastern city of dresden and several hundred in the south-eastern town of weiden near the czech border .
" a day of disappointment and rage " may day is traditionally marked by union rallies in many european countries and the global economic downturn was expected to see swell crowds this year .
german union leaders said around 484,000 demonstrators took part in 400 rallies across the country .
" the crisis that is dominating us was caused by unscrupulous speculators , " the head of the dgb labor confederation , michael sommer , told a may day rally in bremen .
" this crisis is worse than anyone expected .
there is no light at the end of the tunnel , " he said , adding that the economic downturn had exacerbated public anger over growing wage disparities .
frank-walter steinmeier , who is leading germany 's social democrats into the september election against chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said he understood workers ' rage .
" the crisis is a result of greed and irresponsible actions , " he told a rally in ludwigshafen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters carrying a " nazi-free " banner tried to block an npd rally in berlin " we need a new direction .
that 's why this may 1 is such a special may day .
it 's a day of disappointment and outrage . "
chancellor merkel rejected assertions that the economic crisis increased the intensity of this year 's may day protests .
" i do n't think anything of such speculation , " merkel told the hannover daily neue presse .
violent protests across europe police and protestors also clashed in the turkish city of istanbul .
demonstrators smashed windows in banks and shops , and threw stones petrol bombs .
riot police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse the angry crowds .

bralizian grafite scored a penalty one minute before the final whistle to put the team one step closer to winning the championship .
with just four matches to go , the team from northern germany have a three point lead over bayern munich , whose new coach jupp heynckes got the defending champions off to a winning start with a 2-1 victory against borussia moenchengladbach .
after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .
this week we are going to stuttgart and that will be a very tough game for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath : " now we are the title favorites ! "
wolfsburg coach felix magath , who has been linked to a possible move to schalke next season , said that his side had started nervously .
" leading the table the players were a bit nervous and they did not do as well as i would have liked them to .
" but in the second half we were as good as we can be and i now think that we are favourites for the title .
we still have two matches at home and we just want to win as many games as we can . "
wolfsburg have 60 points , while bayern are on 57 .
hertha berlin , who are currently fourth in the standings , could close the gap on wolfsburg on sunday .
hertha who have 55 points face a difficult away trip to sv hamburg , who are just a point behind in fifth place .
wolfsburg looked far from convincing in the first half against the free-falling hoffenheim side , who topped the table at the winter break , but an improved performance in the second half saw them run out convincing victors .
in munich , bayern took the lead in the 33rd minute through bastian schweinsteiger , but just five minutes later the visitors drew level when filip daems converted a penalty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's bastian schweinsteiger wears his heart on his sleeve three minutes from the break hamit altintop scored the winner for bayern , who earlier in the week fired coach juergen klinsmann and replaced him with heynckes .
the coach , who will only be in charge of the side for the remainder of the season , said that his side did not do well in the second half .
" we played better in the first half , even though we created more chances in the second half .
we should have scored more goals though . "
another of the title challengers , vfb stuttgart , lost some ground as they were held to a 2-2 draw at struggling arminia bielefeld .
they remain third in the table on 55 points .
in other matches schalke 's hopes of qualifying for the europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen , while karlsruhe missed out on an opportunity of improving their chances of avoiding relegation , as they were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers energie cottbus .

after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .
this week we are going to stuttgart and that will be a very tough game for us . "

bralizian grafite scored a penalty one minute before the final whistle to put the team one step closer to winning the championship .
with just four matches to go , the team from northern germany have a three point lead over bayern munich , whose new coach jupp heynckes got the defending champions off to a winning start with a 2-1 victory against borussia moenchengladbach .
after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .
this week we are going to stuttgart and that will be a very tough game for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath : " now we are the title favorites ! "
wolfsburg coach felix magath , who has been linked to a possible move to schalke next season , said that his side had started nervously .
" leading the table the players were a bit nervous and they did not do as well as i would have liked them to .
" but in the second half we were as good as we can be and i now think that we are favourites for the title .
we still have two matches at home and we just want to win as many games as we can . "
wolfsburg have 60 points , while bayern are on 57 .
hertha berlin , who are currently fourth in the standings , could close the gap on wolfsburg on sunday .
hertha who have 55 points face a difficult away trip to sv hamburg , who are just a point behind in fifth place .
wolfsburg looked far from convincing in the first half against the free-falling hoffenheim side , who topped the table at the winter break , but an improved performance in the second half saw them run out convincing victors .
in munich , bayern took the lead in the 33rd minute through bastian schweinsteiger , but just five minutes later the visitors drew level when filip daems converted a penalty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's bastian schweinsteiger wears his heart on his sleeve three minutes from the break hamit altintop scored the winner for bayern , who earlier in the week fired coach juergen klinsmann and replaced him with heynckes .
the coach , who will only be in charge of the side for the remainder of the season , said that his side did not do well in the second half .
" we played better in the first half , even though we created more chances in the second half .
we should have scored more goals though . "
another of the title challengers , vfb stuttgart , lost some ground as they were held to a 2-2 draw at struggling arminia bielefeld .
they remain third in the table on 55 points .
in other matches schalke 's hopes of qualifying for the europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen , while karlsruhe missed out on an opportunity of improving their chances of avoiding relegation , as they were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers energie cottbus .

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the city in the 1967 six day war , declaring the city its " eternal , undivided capital . "
the move has not been recognised by the international community and all foreign embassies are located in the commercial capital tel aviv . ml , rm , sh , ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , nato forces foiled pirates ' attempts to capture a norwegian tanker in the gulf of aden . the most recent incident took place in the early hours of saturday morning , when the british-owned and maltese-flagged bulk carrier ariana was hijacked in a rare overnight attack northwest of the seychelle islands .
the crew members are all ukrainian .
ship-owner seven seas maritime has not given the exact number of people aboard .
nato forced to release pirates just hours before , a portuguese warship thwarted an attempt by heavily-armed pirates to take control of a norwegian tanker off the coast of somalia .
nato officials said the portuguese warship corte-real captured , disarmed and briefly detained 19 pirates after they attempted to attack the norwegian-owned oil tanker kition in the gulf of aden late on friday .
however , after consultation with somali officials on shore , the suspected pirates had to be released by the portuguese , on the grounds that they had not attacked that country 's property or citizens .

in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .
silver lining however , koehler also forecasted that the crisis could have a positive side as well .
he said this included a more cooperative atmosphere in companies , an increase in volunteer work , and more innovation .
he also said that the crisis could also benefit the environment , as companies become more energy-efficient in an attempt to reduce costs .

schwan - who also ran against koehler in 2004 - is actively campaigning for the largely ceremonial office , which is normally expected to be above partisan party politics .
she recently said she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the city in the 1967 six day war , declaring the city its " eternal , undivided capital . "

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the city in the 1967 six day war , declaring the city its " eternal , undivided capital . "
the move has not been recognised by the international community and all foreign embassies are located in the commercial capital tel aviv . ml , rm , sh , ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

attacks on police accompanied a protest of 5,000 leftists in the central berlin district of kreuzberg .
a police spokesman said there were injuries on both sides .
far-left demonstrators had also fought running battles with police in berlin and hamburg on the night leading into may 1 , known as walpurgisnacht , setting fire to cars and rubbish bins and throwing stones at traffic .
" on the one hand there are people out in the streets protesting peacefully against the economic crisis and there 's nothing at all wrong with that , " police spokesman frank miller told n-tv television from the scene of a riot in the eastern berlin district of friedrichshain .
" but when people burn cars and trash containers and commit other criminal acts - that has nothing to do with political protests , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dgb head michael sommer said people were right to be angry about the economic crisis on friday police also counted 1,800 demonstrators in another leftist crowd which hurled paint at the german finance ministry building in berlin , leaving 60 blotches on the facade .

" this crisis is worse than anyone expected .
there is no light at the end of the tunnel , " he said , adding that the economic downturn had exacerbated public anger over growing wage disparities .
frank-walter steinmeier , who is leading germany 's social democrats into the september election against chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , said he understood workers ' rage .
" the crisis is a result of greed and irresponsible actions , " he told a rally in ludwigshafen .

" i do n't think anything of such speculation , " merkel told the hannover daily neue presse .

in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .

nato forced to release pirates just hours before , a portuguese warship thwarted an attempt by heavily-armed pirates to take control of a norwegian tanker off the coast of somalia .
nato officials said the portuguese warship corte-real captured , disarmed and briefly detained 19 pirates after they attempted to attack the norwegian-owned oil tanker kition in the gulf of aden late on friday .
however , after consultation with somali officials on shore , the suspected pirates had to be released by the portuguese , on the grounds that they had not attacked that country 's property or citizens .

pirate hostages return home also on saturday the 23 crew members of a phillipine tanker seized by somali pirates have returned home after being held hostage for more than five months .

attacks on police accompanied a protest of 5,000 leftists in the central berlin district of kreuzberg .
a police spokesman said there were injuries on both sides .
far-left demonstrators had also fought running battles with police in berlin and hamburg on the night leading into may 1 , known as walpurgisnacht , setting fire to cars and rubbish bins and throwing stones at traffic .
" on the one hand there are people out in the streets protesting peacefully against the economic crisis and there 's nothing at all wrong with that , " police spokesman frank miller told n-tv television from the scene of a riot in the eastern berlin district of friedrichshain .
" but when people burn cars and trash containers and commit other criminal acts - that has nothing to do with political protests , " he said .

they also fought with police , who dispersed the attackers with truncheons and took 150 people into custody .

" i condemn this cowardly act and my thoughts are with the family of the killed solider and his injured companions , " chancellor angela merkel said in an interview with the newspaper neue presse .
" however , " she went on , " it would be wrong to withdraw our troops in afghanistan from the mission that we , with the international community , have taken over . "
merkel said it was in german interests to stabilise the country so that " the world never has to face another terror attack like that of september 11 " .
chancellor merkel believes the combination of military engagement and civil reconstruction are the only ways to achieve that .
germany 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , on tour in afghanistan , also echoed merkel 's message , telling soldiers based in masar-i-scharif , that " the mission will continue . "
soldier 's body comes home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,800 soldiers in afghanistan meanwhile , the body of the 21-year-old solider killed this week while on patrol is scheduled to arrive home in germany on saturday .
a private ceremony , closed to the media and public , will be held .
an official funeral service is planned this coming week in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg .
two other soldiers injured in the attack will also return to germany for further treatment .
the soldiers had been patrolling an area north-west of the city of kunduz when they were attacked with small arms and grenades on wednesday .

bralizian grafite scored a penalty one minute before the final whistle to put the team one step closer to winning the championship .
with just four matches to go , the team from northern germany have a three point lead over bayern munich , whose new coach jupp heynckes got the defending champions off to a winning start with a 2-1 victory against borussia moenchengladbach .
after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .
this week we are going to stuttgart and that will be a very tough game for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath : " now we are the title favorites ! "
wolfsburg coach felix magath , who has been linked to a possible move to schalke next season , said that his side had started nervously .
" leading the table the players were a bit nervous and they did not do as well as i would have liked them to .
" but in the second half we were as good as we can be and i now think that we are favourites for the title .
we still have two matches at home and we just want to win as many games as we can . "
wolfsburg have 60 points , while bayern are on 57 .
hertha berlin , who are currently fourth in the standings , could close the gap on wolfsburg on sunday .
hertha who have 55 points face a difficult away trip to sv hamburg , who are just a point behind in fifth place .
wolfsburg looked far from convincing in the first half against the free-falling hoffenheim side , who topped the table at the winter break , but an improved performance in the second half saw them run out convincing victors .
in munich , bayern took the lead in the 33rd minute through bastian schweinsteiger , but just five minutes later the visitors drew level when filip daems converted a penalty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's bastian schweinsteiger wears his heart on his sleeve three minutes from the break hamit altintop scored the winner for bayern , who earlier in the week fired coach juergen klinsmann and replaced him with heynckes .
the coach , who will only be in charge of the side for the remainder of the season , said that his side did not do well in the second half .
" we played better in the first half , even though we created more chances in the second half .
we should have scored more goals though . "
another of the title challengers , vfb stuttgart , lost some ground as they were held to a 2-2 draw at struggling arminia bielefeld .
they remain third in the table on 55 points .
in other matches schalke 's hopes of qualifying for the europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen , while karlsruhe missed out on an opportunity of improving their chances of avoiding relegation , as they were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers energie cottbus .
borussia dortmund won 2-0 at eintracht frankfurt .
on friday , hanover 96 virtually guaranteed themselves a place in the bundesliga next season as they won 2-0 at vfl bochum . nrt / gb dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

far-left demonstrators had also fought running battles with police in berlin and hamburg on the night leading into may 1 , known as walpurgisnacht , setting fire to cars and rubbish bins and throwing stones at traffic .
" on the one hand there are people out in the streets protesting peacefully against the economic crisis and there 's nothing at all wrong with that , " police spokesman frank miller told n-tv television from the scene of a riot in the eastern berlin district of friedrichshain .
" but when people burn cars and trash containers and commit other criminal acts - that has nothing to do with political protests , " he said .

" i condemn this cowardly act and my thoughts are with the family of the killed solider and his injured companions , " chancellor angela merkel said in an interview with the newspaper neue presse .
" however , " she went on , " it would be wrong to withdraw our troops in afghanistan from the mission that we , with the international community , have taken over . "
merkel said it was in german interests to stabilise the country so that " the world never has to face another terror attack like that of september 11 " .
chancellor merkel believes the combination of military engagement and civil reconstruction are the only ways to achieve that .
germany 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , on tour in afghanistan , also echoed merkel 's message , telling soldiers based in masar-i-scharif , that " the mission will continue . "
soldier 's body comes home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has about 3,800 soldiers in afghanistan meanwhile , the body of the 21-year-old solider killed this week while on patrol is scheduled to arrive home in germany on saturday .
a private ceremony , closed to the media and public , will be held .
an official funeral service is planned this coming week in the southern state of baden-wuerttemberg .
two other soldiers injured in the attack will also return to germany for further treatment .

in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .
silver lining however , koehler also forecasted that the crisis could have a positive side as well .
he said this included a more cooperative atmosphere in companies , an increase in volunteer work , and more innovation .
he also said that the crisis could also benefit the environment , as companies become more energy-efficient in an attempt to reduce costs .
repeat of 2004 candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd presidential candidate gesine schwan is running for the second time a former leader in the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , koehler is backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in the up-coming election . the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who currently share power with the cdu have put forward their own candidate , gesine schwan .
schwan - who also ran against koehler in 2004 - is actively campaigning for the largely ceremonial office , which is normally expected to be above partisan party politics .
she recently said she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .

in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .
silver lining however , koehler also forecasted that the crisis could have a positive side as well .
he said this included a more cooperative atmosphere in companies , an increase in volunteer work , and more innovation .
he also said that the crisis could also benefit the environment , as companies become more energy-efficient in an attempt to reduce costs .
repeat of 2004 candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd presidential candidate gesine schwan is running for the second time a former leader in the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , koehler is backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in the up-coming election . the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who currently share power with the cdu have put forward their own candidate , gesine schwan .
schwan - who also ran against koehler in 2004 - is actively campaigning for the largely ceremonial office , which is normally expected to be above partisan party politics .
she recently said she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .

this year 's entry will have on-stage support from burlesque beauty dita von teese . the american performer will apply her feminine touch to the " miss kiss kiss bang " song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

this year 's entry will have on-stage support from burlesque beauty dita von teese . the american performer will apply her feminine touch to the " miss kiss kiss bang " song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

on friday , nato forces foiled pirates ' attempts to capture a norwegian tanker in the gulf of aden . the most recent incident took place in the early hours of saturday morning , when the british-owned and maltese-flagged bulk carrier ariana was hijacked in a rare overnight attack northwest of the seychelle islands .
the crew members are all ukrainian .
ship-owner seven seas maritime has not given the exact number of people aboard .
nato forced to release pirates just hours before , a portuguese warship thwarted an attempt by heavily-armed pirates to take control of a norwegian tanker off the coast of somalia .
nato officials said the portuguese warship corte-real captured , disarmed and briefly detained 19 pirates after they attempted to attack the norwegian-owned oil tanker kition in the gulf of aden late on friday .
however , after consultation with somali officials on shore , the suspected pirates had to be released by the portuguese , on the grounds that they had not attacked that country 's property or citizens .
lieutenant-commander alexandre santos fernandes said it was the first time nato forces had found pirates armed with raw explosives .
the explosives were destroyed , along with four automatic rifles and nine rocket-propelled grenades .

the ship was captured by pirates off the coast of somalia on april 4 .

pirate hostages return home also on saturday the 23 crew members of a phillipine tanker seized by somali pirates have returned home after being held hostage for more than five months .
the pirates seized the chemical tanker stolt strength in the gulf of aden in november as it was heading to india with a cargo of phosphoric acid .
the ship and crew were released on april 21 after a ransom of $ 2.5 million -lrb- 1.88 million euros -rrb- was paid .
about 80 other filipinos in seven ships are still being held by somali pirates .

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the city in the 1967 six day war , declaring the city its " eternal , undivided capital . "

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .
these homes now face possible demolition .
the report also claims that planners have earmarked only 13 percent of annexed east jerusalem for palestinian construction , while one third has been expropriated for settlement housing projects .
about 200,000 israeli settlers live in east jerusalem .
israeli settlements there and in the rest of the west bank are one of the main stumbling blocks in the moribund middle east peace process .
israel annexed east jerusalem after capturing the city in the 1967 six day war , declaring the city its " eternal , undivided capital . "

this year 's entry will have on-stage support from burlesque beauty dita von teese . the american performer will apply her feminine touch to the " miss kiss kiss bang " song performed by " alex swings , oscar sings ! " - a duo made up of alex christensen from hamburg and oscar loya from the us .
von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

von teese will dance to the pair 's swing-influenced ditty , wearing an outfit true to her personal style , straight out of the 1940s .
" it was our goal to have an internationally known artist on the stage in moscow as miss kiss , " said thomas schreiber , head of entertainment at ard , the consortium of german broadcasters that organizes germany 's entry .
von teese was the perfect choice , he said , because " she plays with the fantasies of her audience . " the modern-day pin-up is known for her dedicated retro look , love of lingerie , and a marriage with shock rocker marilyn manson that ended in divorce .
none of that may sound very german , but that 's the name of the game at eurovision , where national distinctions are downplayed and the goal is to be liked by europeans of all nationalities .

bralizian grafite scored a penalty one minute before the final whistle to put the team one step closer to winning the championship .
with just four matches to go , the team from northern germany have a three point lead over bayern munich , whose new coach jupp heynckes got the defending champions off to a winning start with a 2-1 victory against borussia moenchengladbach .
after the game dzeko said that the team was still not talking of winning the championship .
" we are looking at each match as it comes .
this week we are going to stuttgart and that will be a very tough game for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : felix magath : " now we are the title favorites ! "
wolfsburg coach felix magath , who has been linked to a possible move to schalke next season , said that his side had started nervously .
" leading the table the players were a bit nervous and they did not do as well as i would have liked them to .
" but in the second half we were as good as we can be and i now think that we are favourites for the title .
we still have two matches at home and we just want to win as many games as we can . "
wolfsburg have 60 points , while bayern are on 57 .
hertha berlin , who are currently fourth in the standings , could close the gap on wolfsburg on sunday .
hertha who have 55 points face a difficult away trip to sv hamburg , who are just a point behind in fifth place .
wolfsburg looked far from convincing in the first half against the free-falling hoffenheim side , who topped the table at the winter break , but an improved performance in the second half saw them run out convincing victors .
in munich , bayern took the lead in the 33rd minute through bastian schweinsteiger , but just five minutes later the visitors drew level when filip daems converted a penalty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern munich 's bastian schweinsteiger wears his heart on his sleeve three minutes from the break hamit altintop scored the winner for bayern , who earlier in the week fired coach juergen klinsmann and replaced him with heynckes .
the coach , who will only be in charge of the side for the remainder of the season , said that his side did not do well in the second half .
" we played better in the first half , even though we created more chances in the second half .
we should have scored more goals though . "
another of the title challengers , vfb stuttgart , lost some ground as they were held to a 2-2 draw at struggling arminia bielefeld .
they remain third in the table on 55 points .
in other matches schalke 's hopes of qualifying for the europa cup received a setback as they were beaten 2-1 at home by bayer leverkusen , while karlsruhe missed out on an opportunity of improving their chances of avoiding relegation , as they were held to a goalless draw by fellow strugglers energie cottbus .

the nurse in regensburg in bavaria , who has not been to mexico recently , has now recovered , the health ministry said .
germany 's other three confirmed cases are in people who had recently returned from mexico .
another case is still unconfirmed in cologne .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg hacker is expecting further transmissions in germany " this is the first time that an infection has occurred within germany , " said joerg hacker , head of the robert-koch-institute , the country 's disease control and prevention agency in berlin .
hacker said a team of experts from the robert-koch-institute had been dispatched to bavaria .
he added that they would help in preventing a potential spread of the virus and try and gather more detailed information on it .
" the new case shows that further transmissions must be reckoned with in germany , " hacker said .
" we are prepared for the situation and this new development does n't change our strategy . "
germany is the second european nation to report a transmission within its borders .
spain 's 13 confirmed cases also include one person who had not recently traveled to mexico , but contracted the disease from his girlfriend , who had visited the country .
domestic transmissions have also occurred in the united states and mexico , according to hacker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel says germany is prepared to deal with an epidemic " the virus has the potency to spread and it has the potential to change genetically and that 's why we remain concerned and watchful , " hacker said .
" germany is well armed " chancellor angela merkel has said germany is prepared if the virus does spread . merkel told the newspaper , neuen presse , that " germany is well-armed to counteract an epidemic , if that occurs . " we have all the requirements to quickly deal with the situation if it intensifies .
our next step is to speak with all the states , to determine whether we have sufficient stocks of the anti-viral medication , " she said .
more cases surface in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico has been hit hardest by the new flu strain france has become the latest european country to confirm cases of the h1n1 flu virus .

cases have also been confirmed in britain , spain , austria , switzerland and the netherlands .
the european centre for disease prevention and control says that the european cases are " almost entirely among those returning from mexico . "
the only fatality outside mexico has been in the united states .
eu rejects travel ban to mexico although mexico appears to be the epicenter of the virus , eu health ministers have rejected a french proposal to suspend all air travel to the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu health ministers have rejected a travel ban to mexico " in the current state of the situation , we are not yet taking this decision , " french health minister roselyne bachelot said following an emergency meeting of eu health ministers in luxembourg on thursday .
however , she added that the plan may be revisited in the future .
other countries , such as germany and spain , have balked at the flight ban proposal , considering it too drastic and having little value , since the outbreak has already spread to four continents .
european ministers also shot down an italian proposal that member states set up a " drug bank " of flu remedies and vaccines , saying that it was up to each member state to decide how best to deal with health problems . kj / cg / nk / rm / ca / ipj , dpa / ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over a quarter of the 225,000 palestinians in annnexed east jerusalem risk having their homes demolished by the israeli authorities because they were built without permits , the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- said in a report published on friday .
to date , approximately 1,500 demolition orders have been issued in east jerusalem , which if implemented , would leave about 9,000 people homeless , almost half of them children .
palestinians say the demolitions are an attempt to push them out of the city , but municipal authorities insist they simply follow the law and raze houses built without the necessary permits .
the ocha report said that at least 28 percent of palestinian homes in east jerusalem have been built without israeli permits , which residents say are nearly impossible to obtain .

" i condemn this cowardly act and my thoughts are with the family of the killed solider and his injured companions , " chancellor angela merkel said in an interview with the newspaper neue presse .
" however , " she went on , " it would be wrong to withdraw our troops in afghanistan from the mission that we , with the international community , have taken over . "
merkel said it was in german interests to stabilise the country so that " the world never has to face another terror attack like that of september 11 " .
chancellor merkel believes the combination of military engagement and civil reconstruction are the only ways to achieve that .
germany 's foreign minister , frank-walter steinmeier , on tour in afghanistan , also echoed merkel 's message , telling soldiers based in masar-i-scharif , that " the mission will continue . "

in an interview in saturday 's edition of the tabloid newspaper bild , koehler complained that they " have , regrettably , remained silent . "
koehler blamed a lack of financial transparency and supervision for the financial crisis .
the 66-year-old , who is the former head of the international monetary fund , excoriated bankers as having " tried to sue for multi-million -lrb- euro -rrb- payments , even though they are personally hardly hurting from the crisis . "
he contrasted this attitude with the situation on the general job market .
" the average workers like the super market cashier , are being punished severely for the smallest of errors , " he said .
seeking his second five-year term as president in the may 23 vote , he said in the interview that the anglo-american model of " casino capitalism " had collapsed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : innovation and energy efficiency cut costs and help the environment " what has failed is the wheeling and dealing without rules , without a sense of proportion and without values , " he said .
silver lining however , koehler also forecasted that the crisis could have a positive side as well .
he said this included a more cooperative atmosphere in companies , an increase in volunteer work , and more innovation .
he also said that the crisis could also benefit the environment , as companies become more energy-efficient in an attempt to reduce costs .
repeat of 2004 candidates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd presidential candidate gesine schwan is running for the second time a former leader in the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , koehler is backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and the opposition free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- in the up-coming election . the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- , who currently share power with the cdu have put forward their own candidate , gesine schwan .
schwan - who also ran against koehler in 2004 - is actively campaigning for the largely ceremonial office , which is normally expected to be above partisan party politics .
she recently said she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .

hundreds of thousands are falling behind with rental payments , largely due to rising unemployment , according to the national landlords association .
the situation was " pretty dire " with at least a third of members owed money , the association added .
in the past year , the association has taken more than 20,000 calls from landlords worried about rent arrears .
' stressful ' landlord rukhsana kashmiri is owed nearly £ 9,000 in rent on her property in north london , after both her tenants lost their jobs .
" i 'm on anti-depressants and pain-killers , " she says .
" my health is not good , and my whole body is aching . "
however tenants are also coming under severe strain .
zoe abbey , 21 , from watford , fell behind with her rent after failing to find a job . "
landlords should talk to their tenants - give them a breathing space " duncan shrubsole crisis and she said the process of being evicted from her flat was extremely stressful .
" it was n't very nice .
you 've got the landlord on the door all the time , and you 're getting letters . "
apart from rising unemployment , another issue is that housing benefit is now paid directly to tenants .
many landlords used to receive the payments themselves .
there can also be a delay of up to two months before housing benefit comes through .
sympathy plea adam sampson , of the housing charity shelter , said the government should now offer support to tenants in the same way it has given help to debt-laden homeowners .
" the government needs to look to see how the payment of housing benefit can be speeded up .
otherwise more tenants are likely to become homeless . "
landlords are also being urged to be sympathetic to the plight of tenants who lose their jobs , and can not pay their rent as a result .
" they should talk to their tenants - give them a breathing space , " said duncan shrubsole from the charity crisis .
with unemployment expected to rise further over the coming months , most expect rental arrears to go up too , with observers saying this will inevitably also lead to more evictions as well .
