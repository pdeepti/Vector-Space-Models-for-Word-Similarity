but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .
effort to stabilise the country ahead of presidential elections the aim of the current offensive in northern afghanistan , hit by an increase in taliban-linked attacks , is to stabilize the region before presidential polls in august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke and karzai worry about the safety of upcoming presidential elections on sunday , one of president hamid karzai 's vice presidential candidates managed to escape unscathed from an attack by taliban insurgents .
mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's an incredible feeling after what feels like such a long time away .
i 'm just so proud of the guys .
they never gave up , which is something very rare to see in a large group of people , " hamilton said .
the defending world champion started four back in the pack , but cruised to victory in 1 hour 38 minutes , 23 seconds ahead of kimi raikkonen in a ferrari who came in second and australian mark webber , who finished third .
" the car was so nice to drive and the team have done such a great job .
we did n't expect to win - but the car felt fantastic .
it 's incredibly special to get back up here , " hamilton said .
sebastian vettel , who was second in the running for the title race , had to retire after he was involved in a first corner contact with raikkonen , which made his car undriveable .
the leader in the standings , britain 's jenson button had to settle for seventh place just ahead of jarno trulli , but still has 70 points after 10 races .
webber has 51.5 followed by vettel with 47 points .

they share their expertise , show art lovers the city 's hot spots and open up their private studios .
no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .
the city is home to more than 6,000 artists .
what started in the hip berlin district of mitte has since spread all over the city , and the sheer abundance of the offerings can be overwhelming at times . to help art lovers wade through this embarrassment of riches , norbert kron founded art escort .
the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

the publicly owned bank has received state aid that has saved it from collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis .
carstensen said nonnenmacher was legally entitled to the money , but that there was no " moral justification for the payment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein premier harry carstensen the ceo 's bonus has triggered a storm of controversy in schleswig-holstein and was one of the central issues behind the acrimonious collapse of the coalition government in kiel last week .
carstensen said both parties had supported the bonus , but his former social democrat partners accused him of lying . carstensen has since confirmed that he gave false information to parliament by saying the spd approved the bonus .
after sacking four social democrat ministers , the premier lost a confidence vote on thursday .
it was a move aimed at forcing forward fresh elections , which the conservatives are widely expected to win .
in the likely event of an election victory , carstensen has promised savings measures and tough decisions to deal with an economic crisis which has taken a dramatic toll on the state 's revenues. nw / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .

that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .

contador finished the 96th edition of the world 's toughest bicycle race with a lead of 4 minutes 11 seconds ahead of luxembourg 's andy schleck , who pulled in second .

three-time tour winner greg lemond already started the process with a column he wrote in the french newspaper le monde .
in the article lemond called contador 's 15th stage , when he took over the leader 's yellow jersey , a brilliant climb to the finish .
during that climb , wrote lemond , contador set a new speed record .
lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .

what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.07.2009 after 25 years of conflict , turkey makes overtures to kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the pro-kurdish democratic society party demonstrating in 2007 with a banner that reads " live and let live " as votes cast by iraqi kurds saturday are counted , kurds in turkey are mulling recent overtures made by ankara .
after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

contador finished the 96th edition of the world 's toughest bicycle race with a lead of 4 minutes 11 seconds ahead of luxembourg 's andy schleck , who pulled in second .

in the article lemond called contador 's 15th stage , when he took over the leader 's yellow jersey , a brilliant climb to the finish .
during that climb , wrote lemond , contador set a new speed record .
lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .

" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have been trying to stop the flat-rate fee system in brothels , arguing that it violates prostitutes ' dignity . while the global recession has hit the financial sector , the export industry and car companies , it has also been felt in the world 's oldest business sector - prostitution .
brothels across germany have seen their client numbers dwindle .
since they are not at the top of the list for a government bailout , they are having to look for other ways to battle the downturn .
one such way which has made headlines in germany is the " flat-rate " fee system , offered by at least four brothels in germany , where prostitution in legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the operators of the pussy club say the flat-rate plan brings in more customers the " pussy club " chain offers such a flat rate , which entitles customers to unlimited sexual services all day for a one-off entry fee of 70 euros -lrb- $ 100 -rrb- .
but the new discount scheme has triggered a wave of protests , especially in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg .
violation of human dignity ?
authorities there are now trying to shut down the brothels , arguing the new pricing plan violates the human dignity of the women working there .
baden-wuerttemberg justice minister ulrich goll told germany 's der spiegel magazine that there was a strong enough legal justification for police and authorities to intervene .
" if you look at the way these brothels advertise , then there 's a violation of the human dignity of the prostitutes who work there , " he said , adding that authorities " were working on a way to stop the brothels from operating the way they do under that current fee system . "
baden-wuerttemberg interior minister heribert rech , who has led a campaign against one particular brothel , said the " price suggests women there are being exploited . "
on sunday , police and justice officials searched brothels using the plan in stuttgart , heidelberg , schoenefeld near berlin and wuppertal .
they say they suspect the bordells of social security fraud , employing foreign prostitutes without permission and not maintaining hygiene standards .
good for business the brothels ' advertising slogan has a simple message : " sex with all women , as long as you want , as often as you want . "
for 70 euros customers are entitled to all the sex , food and drink they want between 10 am and 4 pm .
the evening flat rate rises to 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fixed price for all the sex , food and drink customers want the operator of the " pussy club " brothels , patricia floreiu , defended the new pricing scheme , arguing that most customers leave after one or two sessions and that none of the women are forced into working under the new terms . " it simply brings in more customers .
hardly anyone can ' do it ' more than twice .
so basically the flat rate is mostly for the free beer , " she says .
a group of 77 sex workers bought advertising space in two national newspapers , arguing that the campaign by officials was simply a way to get brothels banned altogether .
" get off our backs - no ban on brothels with or without ' flat rates ' , " read the ads ' headline .
" under the guise of ' humane working conditions ' , they are in reality plotting to ban brothels and threaten our livelihood .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three-time tour winner greg lemond already started the process with a column he wrote in the french newspaper le monde .
in the article lemond called contador 's 15th stage , when he took over the leader 's yellow jersey , a brilliant climb to the finish .
during that climb , wrote lemond , contador set a new speed record .
lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .
contador ' has been the subject of doping rumors before , ever since documents with the initials ac were found in the home of a spanish doctor who was in the middle of one of the worst doping scandals in sports. av / afp / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.07.2009 after 25 years of conflict , turkey makes overtures to kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the pro-kurdish democratic society party demonstrating in 2007 with a banner that reads " live and let live " as votes cast by iraqi kurds saturday are counted , kurds in turkey are mulling recent overtures made by ankara .
after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .

what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .

the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

and yet when he did well in the heats , he decided to go for the gold . germany 's paul biedermann got the gold and broke the world record as a bonus when he won the 400 meter freestyle championship in rome .
once the race started , biedermann was not running away with it , and was in fourth at the 100 meter mark .

biedermann 's time of 3 minutes 40.07 seconds was a new world record , beating the previous record set by ian thorpe 's in 2002 by one hundredth of a second .
" it was a wonderful moment , " biedermann said to reporters after the race .

today was my day . "
in second place , mellouli was 1.04 seconds off the pace , with the bronze medal going to to chinese swimmer zhang lin .

but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

contador finished the 96th edition of the world 's toughest bicycle race with a lead of 4 minutes 11 seconds ahead of luxembourg 's andy schleck , who pulled in second .

in the article lemond called contador 's 15th stage , when he took over the leader 's yellow jersey , a brilliant climb to the finish .
during that climb , wrote lemond , contador set a new speed record .
lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .
effort to stabilise the country ahead of presidential elections the aim of the current offensive in northern afghanistan , hit by an increase in taliban-linked attacks , is to stabilize the region before presidential polls in august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke and karzai worry about the safety of upcoming presidential elections on sunday , one of president hamid karzai 's vice presidential candidates managed to escape unscathed from an attack by taliban insurgents .
mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .
i say again : it is not going to be perfect . " db / dpa / afp / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

that 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.07.2009 after 25 years of conflict , turkey makes overtures to kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the pro-kurdish democratic society party demonstrating in 2007 with a banner that reads " live and let live " as votes cast by iraqi kurds saturday are counted , kurds in turkey are mulling recent overtures made by ankara .
after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .

over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”

how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .

they share their expertise , show art lovers the city 's hot spots and open up their private studios .
no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .
the city is home to more than 6,000 artists .
what started in the hip berlin district of mitte has since spread all over the city , and the sheer abundance of the offerings can be overwhelming at times . to help art lovers wade through this embarrassment of riches , norbert kron founded art escort .
the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they share their expertise , show art lovers the city 's hot spots and open up their private studios .
no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .
the city is home to more than 6,000 artists .
what started in the hip berlin district of mitte has since spread all over the city , and the sheer abundance of the offerings can be overwhelming at times . to help art lovers wade through this embarrassment of riches , norbert kron founded art escort .
the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

" i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

also on sunday , it was announced a second student had died in prison . opposition leaders mir hossein mousavi and mehdi karroubi have applied to the iranian interior ministry for permission to hold a mourning ceremony for those killed in the country 's post election unrest after the june 12 presidential polls , the semi-official ilna news agency reported .
" we request permission to hold a ceremony to commemorate the 40th day after the deaths of our citizens who lost their lives following the start of the saddening events , " the two politicians said in their request to iranian minister for the interior sadeq mahsouli .
they asked to be allowed to hold a 90-minute commemoration promising there would be no political actions , slogan or speeches .
all they said they intended were recitals from the koran and a commemorative silence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests in iran continue weeks after the election no date was mentioned in the letter .
the opposition leaders want to hold the ceremony at tehran 's " grand mosala , " a prayer location where tens of thousands can gather , the letter said .
should the interior ministry decline the request , any gathering would be considered illegal and authorities and police would be authorized to intervene .
rising death toll this comes along news released on sunday that an iranian student who was arrested during the recent protests died in prison .
on saturday , opposition newspapers had reported the death of another student who was also arrested during the protests .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.07.2009 after 25 years of conflict , turkey makes overtures to kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the pro-kurdish democratic society party demonstrating in 2007 with a banner that reads " live and let live " as votes cast by iraqi kurds saturday are counted , kurds in turkey are mulling recent overtures made by ankara .
after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .

over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”

biedermann 's time of 3 minutes 40.07 seconds was a new world record , beating the previous record set by ian thorpe 's in 2002 by one hundredth of a second .
" it was a wonderful moment , " biedermann said to reporters after the race .

today was my day . "
in second place , mellouli was 1.04 seconds off the pace , with the bronze medal going to to chinese swimmer zhang lin .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”

" we request permission to hold a ceremony to commemorate the 40th day after the deaths of our citizens who lost their lives following the start of the saddening events , " the two politicians said in their request to iranian minister for the interior sadeq mahsouli .

dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .

that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contador finished the 96th edition of the world 's toughest bicycle race with a lead of 4 minutes 11 seconds ahead of luxembourg 's andy schleck , who pulled in second .
britain 's mark cavendish nailed his sixth stage win of the tour in a sprint after the 164-kilometer -lrb- 101.9-mile -rrb- ride from montereau-fault-yonne to the champs-elysees .
he outsprinted fellow columbia team mate mark renshaw of australia and american tyler farrar .
the winner of the green jersey for the points classification was norway 's thor hushovd and italy 's franco pellizotti won the polka dot jersey for the best climber .
of course , it is n't over until it is over : the post-race doping tests still have to be done .
and alberto contador 's great performance will naturally come under scrutiny .
three-time tour winner greg lemond already started the process with a column he wrote in the french newspaper le monde .
in the article lemond called contador 's 15th stage , when he took over the leader 's yellow jersey , a brilliant climb to the finish .
during that climb , wrote lemond , contador set a new speed record .
lemond goes on to detail that , for this sort of performance , contador would have required an aerobic capacity , or oxygen intake , of 99.5 ml / mn / kg .
" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .
contador ' has been the subject of doping rumors before , ever since documents with the initials ac were found in the home of a spanish doctor who was in the middle of one of the worst doping scandals in sports. av / afp / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they share their expertise , show art lovers the city 's hot spots and open up their private studios .
no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .
the city is home to more than 6,000 artists .
what started in the hip berlin district of mitte has since spread all over the city , and the sheer abundance of the offerings can be overwhelming at times . to help art lovers wade through this embarrassment of riches , norbert kron founded art escort .
the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

the publicly owned bank has received state aid that has saved it from collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis .
carstensen said nonnenmacher was legally entitled to the money , but that there was no " moral justification for the payment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein premier harry carstensen the ceo 's bonus has triggered a storm of controversy in schleswig-holstein and was one of the central issues behind the acrimonious collapse of the coalition government in kiel last week .
carstensen said both parties had supported the bonus , but his former social democrat partners accused him of lying . carstensen has since confirmed that he gave false information to parliament by saying the spd approved the bonus .
after sacking four social democrat ministers , the premier lost a confidence vote on thursday .
it was a move aimed at forcing forward fresh elections , which the conservatives are widely expected to win .
in the likely event of an election victory , carstensen has promised savings measures and tough decisions to deal with an economic crisis which has taken a dramatic toll on the state 's revenues. nw / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .
effort to stabilise the country ahead of presidential elections the aim of the current offensive in northern afghanistan , hit by an increase in taliban-linked attacks , is to stabilize the region before presidential polls in august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke and karzai worry about the safety of upcoming presidential elections on sunday , one of president hamid karzai 's vice presidential candidates managed to escape unscathed from an attack by taliban insurgents .
mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they share their expertise , show art lovers the city 's hot spots and open up their private studios .
no sex involved . berlin is known for its dynamic , cutting-edge art scene which attracts art lovers from around the world .
the city is home to more than 6,000 artists .
what started in the hip berlin district of mitte has since spread all over the city , and the sheer abundance of the offerings can be overwhelming at times . to help art lovers wade through this embarrassment of riches , norbert kron founded art escort .
the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : a new era in bayreuth the charm offensive : bayreuth at the dawn of a new era a new era dawns at the bayreuth festival dark history still haunts bayreuth festival classical music -pipe- 26.07.2009 wagner festival gets a revamp , but is it only skin deep ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for those without tickets to get into the opera house , some performances will be streamed on the internet richard wagner 's two great-granddaughters , directors of bayreuth 's renowned opera festival , are repolishing the event .
deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .
effort to stabilise the country ahead of presidential elections the aim of the current offensive in northern afghanistan , hit by an increase in taliban-linked attacks , is to stabilize the region before presidential polls in august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke and karzai worry about the safety of upcoming presidential elections on sunday , one of president hamid karzai 's vice presidential candidates managed to escape unscathed from an attack by taliban insurgents .
mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

leading opposition politicians are now asking why she had the car with her on vacation in the first place . it began as a small news item : german health minister 's limousine stolen in alicante , spain .
but then people started asking questions like : why does a german health minister need an armored limousine while on vacation in spain ?
how did the limousine get there in the first place ?
" i would like to know which of mrs schmidt 's appointments required an official car and chauffeur in alicante and why it was not possible for the embassy to arrange transportation , " said otto fricke , the head of the parliamentary budget committee in an interview in german newspaper bild am sonntag .
the news comes just two months before a general election .
this is not good news for schmidt 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is challenging chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the september 27 election .
schmidt said she paid her own way to fly to alicante , but had her chauffeur drive the mercedes s-class limo 2,387 kilometers from berlin to spain .
reiner holznagel , head of the taxpayers ' union in germany , has also raised questions , according to bild am sonntag .
" we want an explanation as to why her official car had to be taken some 5,000 kilometres across europe .
taxpayers ' money should not be used to keep ministers in comfort , " said holznagel .
a spokeswoman for schmidt said that the minister was only planning to use the car for official functions , such as a meeting with an organization of german expatriates living in spain .
she also said that the minister had rented a car in spain for her own private use. av / afp / reuters / bas editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .

mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .

after sacking four social democrat ministers , the premier lost a confidence vote on thursday .
it was a move aimed at forcing forward fresh elections , which the conservatives are widely expected to win .

webber has 51.5 followed by vettel with 47 points .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

i 'm just so proud of the guys .
they never gave up , which is something very rare to see in a large group of people , " hamilton said .
the defending world champion started four back in the pack , but cruised to victory in 1 hour 38 minutes , 23 seconds ahead of kimi raikkonen in a ferrari who came in second and australian mark webber , who finished third .
" the car was so nice to drive and the team have done such a great job .
we did n't expect to win - but the car felt fantastic .

webber has 51.5 followed by vettel with 47 points .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .

dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .

that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .

they have been trying to stop the flat-rate fee system in brothels , arguing that it violates prostitutes ' dignity . while the global recession has hit the financial sector , the export industry and car companies , it has also been felt in the world 's oldest business sector - prostitution .
brothels across germany have seen their client numbers dwindle .
since they are not at the top of the list for a government bailout , they are having to look for other ways to battle the downturn .
one such way which has made headlines in germany is the " flat-rate " fee system , offered by at least four brothels in germany , where prostitution in legal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the operators of the pussy club say the flat-rate plan brings in more customers the " pussy club " chain offers such a flat rate , which entitles customers to unlimited sexual services all day for a one-off entry fee of 70 euros -lrb- $ 100 -rrb- .
but the new discount scheme has triggered a wave of protests , especially in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg .
violation of human dignity ?
authorities there are now trying to shut down the brothels , arguing the new pricing plan violates the human dignity of the women working there .
baden-wuerttemberg justice minister ulrich goll told germany 's der spiegel magazine that there was a strong enough legal justification for police and authorities to intervene .
" if you look at the way these brothels advertise , then there 's a violation of the human dignity of the prostitutes who work there , " he said , adding that authorities " were working on a way to stop the brothels from operating the way they do under that current fee system . "
baden-wuerttemberg interior minister heribert rech , who has led a campaign against one particular brothel , said the " price suggests women there are being exploited . "
on sunday , police and justice officials searched brothels using the plan in stuttgart , heidelberg , schoenefeld near berlin and wuppertal .
they say they suspect the bordells of social security fraud , employing foreign prostitutes without permission and not maintaining hygiene standards .
good for business the brothels ' advertising slogan has a simple message : " sex with all women , as long as you want , as often as you want . "
for 70 euros customers are entitled to all the sex , food and drink they want between 10 am and 4 pm .
the evening flat rate rises to 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fixed price for all the sex , food and drink customers want the operator of the " pussy club " brothels , patricia floreiu , defended the new pricing scheme , arguing that most customers leave after one or two sessions and that none of the women are forced into working under the new terms . " it simply brings in more customers .
hardly anyone can ' do it ' more than twice .
so basically the flat rate is mostly for the free beer , " she says .
a group of 77 sex workers bought advertising space in two national newspapers , arguing that the campaign by officials was simply a way to get brothels banned altogether .
" get off our backs - no ban on brothels with or without ' flat rates ' , " read the ads ' headline .
" under the guise of ' humane working conditions ' , they are in reality plotting to ban brothels and threaten our livelihood .

rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle 's music editor says there 's a lot of new style , but the substance remains to be seen . the 98th richard wagner opera festival opened on saturday in bayreuth in southern germany with a very brief appearance by the new directors eva wagner-pasquier , and her half-sister , katharina wagner .
the two women are great-granddaughters of wagner and have decided to try to give the highly popular event an update .
newslink host jackie wilson spoke to deutsche welle 's music editor rick fulker , who was in bayreuth .
dw : have the two great-granddaughters succeeded in giving the event a new polish ?
rick fulker : judging from the first act of tristan , which we 've just seen at the premiere , you ca n't say much yet because the production already existed and it 's actually rather drab .
the scenery is sort of a run-down luxury liner and there is very little stage action .
in fact if the strike had happened as they thought , the production could have gone along without the stage work , since there is very little to see .
so you ca n't judge on the basis of one act of one performance .
in fact , this year there are no new productions , but there are some things on the side .
they 've revamped the web site again , they 've refreshed the podcasts , they 're reinstating public viewing later in the season and , all in all , there 's an effort being made to show that the two are sort of face-lifting the festival .
they are especially interested in public relations .
a lot of style , but the substance remains to be seen bildunterschrift : katharina wagner -lrb- r -rrb- and her half-sister eva wagner-pasquier so they 're also going very high-tech .
what is this going to mean for the potential audiences of the festival , because we know that demand far exceeds actual ticket availability ?
that 's right .
in fact it 's very interesting , if you go back to richard wagner himself , he wanted to have a festival that was open to everybody free of charge .
so the idea of public viewing and streaming performances on the internet , a selection of them , is going back to the basic wagner idea .
but yes , the festival remains exclusive .
there 's been a sense of myth and secrecy that has surrounded this festival for decades and the directors are now sort of de-mythifying it if you will , yet at the same time it does n't mean there has been a decline of interest , even though many of the performances are now available worldwide .
the directors are the two great-granddaughters of the composer himself , and we know that there has been a family quarrel which has been going on for decades .
they 've said they want to put that to one side , is there any reflection of that to be seen in the festival as it opened saturday ?
they have announced that they are going to get together with all the family members , including some who have been banned from the festival for decades .
the two sisters – basically they 're half-sisters – they did n't even know each other , hardly saw each other for 30 years , after the divorce of wolfgang wagner .
at least the two of them are making every effort to show that they are working in tandem .
they are professing absolute unity in all the substantial matters .

but they wo n't have to get up at the crack of dawn anymore , even to get that coveted spot .
vacationing germans now have the option of reserving their poolside loungers long before they even arrive at their destination .
the option is offered to those booking with the german branch of thomas cook , europe 's second-largest travel company , and is available - for a fee - at nine hotels in turkey , egypt and the canary islands .
mathias brandes , head of communications at thomas cook in germany , told reuter 's news agency that people from other nations wo n't be able to take advantage of the recliner reservation service as it is only offered for vacationers who book their holidays from germany - potentially making an already volatile situation even worse .
two years ago , a bus driver named glyn bowden became so fed up with german tourists reserving every recliner that he set fire to all their towels .
according to britain 's daily mail newspaper , he twice took the towels away and left them on the side of the pool - but on the third day set fire to them .
bowden spent two hours in a cell at a local police station before hotel management could persuade officers to release him without charge. mm / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they will be acting under new rules of engagement .
german defence ministry this weekend issued an updated set of the so-called “ pocket card ” , designed to give the troops a clearer idea of what they are allowed to do under certain conditions .
in recent months , there had been mounting criticism that the soldiers did not have the necessary authority to defend themselves militarily in threatening situations .
bundeswehr soldiers in afghanistan , who are under much stricter rules of engagement than other nato-led forces in the country , will now for the first time be able to use mortar grenades and armoured personnel vehicles in the northern province of kunduz .
carsten spiering , spokesman for the german armed forces in kundus , says it is their mission to support about 800 afghan soldiers and about 100 afghan police , “ wherever and in every way we can . ”
germany has about 3,700 soldiers stationed in afghanistan , serving with the 65,000-strong nato-led force .
effort to stabilise the country ahead of presidential elections the aim of the current offensive in northern afghanistan , hit by an increase in taliban-linked attacks , is to stabilize the region before presidential polls in august . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holbrooke and karzai worry about the safety of upcoming presidential elections on sunday , one of president hamid karzai 's vice presidential candidates managed to escape unscathed from an attack by taliban insurgents .
mohammed qasim fahim and his entourage were driving through kunduz province when an unknown number of gunmen ambushed the convoy .
on saturday , taliban fighters , wearing suicide vests and armed with ak-47 rifles , attacked the main police station in the southeast city of khost .
over the last six months , khost has become one of the most dangerous cities in afghanistan and the scene of repeated deadly attacks .
the fighting left seven militants dead and 14 people wounded .
the worsening taliban insurgency has raised concerns for the security of the polls .
in kabul on saturday , richard holbrooke , u.s. envoy to afghanistan and pakistan , acknowledged that holding elections in the middle of a war is extremely difficult , but he made it clear he believes afghans will go to the polls all the same : " what do you want the afghan people to do ?
to abandon an election because some threats of a small minority of taliban ? ”
impossible , holbrooke says , “ so you hold the best election you can under the circumstances .

" to my knowledge , that number has never been attained by any athlete in any sport , " wrote lemond .

the publicly owned bank has received state aid that has saved it from collapse in the wake of the global financial crisis .
carstensen said nonnenmacher was legally entitled to the money , but that there was no " moral justification for the payment . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleswig-holstein premier harry carstensen the ceo 's bonus has triggered a storm of controversy in schleswig-holstein and was one of the central issues behind the acrimonious collapse of the coalition government in kiel last week .
carstensen said both parties had supported the bonus , but his former social democrat partners accused him of lying . carstensen has since confirmed that he gave false information to parliament by saying the spd approved the bonus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 26.07.2009 after 25 years of conflict , turkey makes overtures to kurds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the pro-kurdish democratic society party demonstrating in 2007 with a banner that reads " live and let live " as votes cast by iraqi kurds saturday are counted , kurds in turkey are mulling recent overtures made by ankara .
after 25 years of conflict between turkey and kurdish separatists , there are signs of a rapprochement . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced last week that his government was working on steps to solve the kurdish conflict , which has claimed over 40,000 lives .
" whether we call it the kurdish , the southeast or eastern problem , whether we call it the kurdish initiative , we have started work on this , " erdogan told a news conference before departing on a trip to syria .
he did not say when the plan would be announced or what it might entail , but did say the interior ministry was already discussing the issue with other branches of government including the military and the national intelligence agency .
abdurrahman kurt , a kurdish member of parliament for the ruling the ak party , said his government would deliver further concessions to kurds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan says government policy toward kurds will change " we are going to open kurdish language institutes in the universities and we are allowing kurdish names to be given to the children and kurdish broadcasting , " he told deutsche welle 's correspondent in istanbul .
however , erdogan has ruled out including the country 's main kurdish party , the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- , in the peace initiative until they denounce the outlawed kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as terrorists .
dtp parliamentary leader emine ayna says peace efforts can not succeed without her party 's participation .
" there is a problem when you talk about this , not with the kurds , but with the chief of the army and intelligence and your ministers , " she told deutsche welle .
political maneuvers the government 's move is seen as a reaction to a plan expected to be put forward by the jailed separatist leader abdullah ocalan on august 15 .
that is the date 25 years ago when the pkk took up arms against the state .
ocalan 's lawyers contacted academics and journalists this month to plug his plans for a " road map . "
details have not been released , but the turkish newspaper sabah reported that it would include a ceasefire , an unconditional amnesty for pkk fighters , kurdish-language education and moves towards greater autonomy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan is still popular among many kurds ocalan has been in prison since 1999 .
originally sentenced to death , his punishment was commuted to life in 2002 when the death penalty was abolished due to pressure from the european union , which turkey is eager to join .
ever since his capture , the 61-year-old has said the pkk is ready to disarm if turkey is prepared to negotiate .
though his calls have received little attention over the past decade , the approaching anniversary of the conflict and his anticipated road map have generated interest in a man still reviled by most turks as a terrorist , but respected by many kurds as a freedom fighter .
in recent years , turkey 's government has softened its hard line on kurds , bowing to some of the demands that have added fuel to the insurgency .
ankara has allowed children to be officially registered with kurdish names , tightened anti-torture laws , and allowed some kurdish-language teaching .
however , fighting has persisted with the pkk using northern iraq as a base for cross-border operations .

the agency essentially " rents " artists for private tours of the city 's galleries , private ateliers , and the renowned bar and club scene . many of the clients " have been to the museums , but they really want to meet someone who is working in the art scene now , " said kron , who is a writer himself .
" they want to meet an artist and get to know their stories and find out how they live and work here in berlin . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wirthmueller said the conversation with clients quickly turns personal via the art escort web site , potential clients can contact the agency and make an appointment with one of ten artists available to escort them on the tours . each artist conducts one to four tours per week , many of them in english . the service is n't limited to the visual arts - writers and film directors are available for bookings as well . a personal touch kron is often asked whether artists make good guides or whether they live up to the stereotype of being egomaniacs - a quality that does n't lend itself especially well to conducting tours .
some of them do , he said , but that 's why he has high standards when selecting his guides . " i think it 's very important that they are kind of open and also listen to the people coming along , " said kron . painter toni wirthmueller , a guide for art escort , said he usually begins tours in his studio by telling clients about himself and his work . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a remaining painted section of the berlin wall is just one example of art outside the city 's museums " within a very short time , it gets very personal , which is , i think , much more interesting for them than being in a group on a guided tour through lots of galleries with one person talking about the art , " he said . the tours ca n't be found in a travel guide or booked through a traditional tour agency - and the exclusivity is precisely what makes them so appealing . " very often it 's people who wanted to become artists or wanted to study art when they were young , " kron said , " but they work in other professions so this is their chance to get close to art . " a unique experience this individualized art experience is n't cheap .
prices for a tour range from 50 to 85 euros -lrb- $ 70 to $ 120 -rrb- per hour for a two or three-hour tour .
but the agency 's clients are willing to dig deep into their pockets for the opportunity to meet those who are at the heart of the art scene - like thomas taubert , director of fiedler taubert contemporary gallery . the visitors sent to him by guide toni wirthmueller " are probably more open and interested in getting information than the regular visitor , " said taubert . many of berlin 's local guides are n't familiar with the subculture that art escort introduces , and that 's a selling point that has proven very successful .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- why brazil gave way on itaipu dam bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:26 gmt , sunday , 26 july 2009 09:26 uk why brazil gave way on itaipu dam an agreement over one of the world 's largest hydro-electric dams signals a change in relations between brazil and paraguay , writes the bbc 's andrea machain .
itaipu - the world 's largest dam in terms of energy generation - is owned equally by brazil and paraguay .
but in a deal signed by the nations ' presidents after months of tough negotiations , paraguay 's sovereignty over it has been acknowledged .
the 31-point document , signed by presidents luiz inacio lula da silva from brazil and fernando lugo from paraguay , was signed in asuncion , paraguay .
it concedes to paraguay the possibility of selling its share of the electricity directly to the brazilian market and triples brazilian compensation payments for the use of its energy .
the deal is considered a significant victory for paraguay 's government .
" the opening of the markets is key to paraguay development and its energy-generating capacity , " carlos mateo , itaipu-paraguay director , told the bbc .
the itaipu power plant is built on the parana river in the region known as the triple border . "
it is not convenient for brazil to have a poor and powerless neighbour " carlos mateo itaipu-paraguay director inaugurated in 1984 , its 20 generator units have an installed capacity of 14,000 megawatts of energy , some 90 % of which is used by brazil .
for many years , paraguay complained about some unfair aspects of a treaty signed in 1973 , when military governments ran both countries .
that treaty required paraguay to sell its unused electricity to brazil at a fixed price until the treaty expires in 2023 .
in return , brazil would pay paraguay a lump sum in compensation which today amounts to $ 124 million a year .
" the deal was always considered unfair by paraguayans , especially when you think that paraguay and brazil paid for the dam equally , " says itaipu paraguayan council member carlos alberto gonzalez , a respected lawyer and former ambassador to brazil .
" each of the countries invested $ 100 million initially and the rest of the money came from loans . "
growing debt many in brazil feel that paraguayan claims are out of place , particularly as they believe brazil paid for the dam alone .
this is untrue , mr gonzalez says , because brazil only acted as a guarantor for the initial loans used to build the dam , but these loans are being paid with funds generated by itaipu energy sales .
matters were made worse in 1985 , when paraguay agreed to brazil 's request to sell itaipu 's electricity below market prices in order to fight an economic crisis in brazil .
during four years itaipu lost $ 4 for each megawatt of the electricity it produced .
this continuous loss led to a debt that paraguayan authorities deem illegal .
the main creditor for this debt is electrobras , the state-owned brazilian electricity company and main itaipu electricity buyer .
this matter was not addressed in the most recent agreement .
in spite of industrial growth elsewhere in the region , in the last 25 years paraguay has only increased its share in the use of itaipu electricity from 2 % to 10 % .
the country also failed to attract significant investments for electro-intensive industries because of its old transmission lines .
" the lines are obsolete , " says carlos mateo , itaipu-paraguay director .
" we lose about 40 % of the electricity in transmission .
about 25 % is lost as a result of overload and 15 % is stolen with illegal connections . "
the new deal signed with brazil also contemplates building a powerful electricity line to the capital . "
what we did today is a demonstration that both countries are 100 % committed to discuss any issues that can improve the life of our people " brazilian president lula this line will be completed in the year 2012 and will be fully paid by itaipu .
many may wonder why brazil changed its attitude towards paraguay after so many years of denying the possibility of reviewing the original arrangements .
personal loyalties ?
some think it may have to do with president lula 's personal sympathy towards former bishop fernando lugo , who won elections in paraguay last year after 60 years of rule by the colorado party .
but it may also have to do with brazil 's new concept of leadership in the region .
" leadership comes with responsibility and lula has incorporated paraguay in his concept of social inclusion , " says dr mateo .
" it is not convenient for brazil to have a poor and powerless neighbour . "

itaipu - the world 's largest dam in terms of energy generation - is owned equally by brazil and paraguay .
but in a deal signed by the nations ' presidents after months of tough negotiations , paraguay 's sovereignty over it has been acknowledged .
the 31-point document , signed by presidents luiz inacio lula da silva from brazil and fernando lugo from paraguay , was signed in asuncion , paraguay .
it concedes to paraguay the possibility of selling its share of the electricity directly to the brazilian market and triples brazilian compensation payments for the use of its energy .
the deal is considered a significant victory for paraguay 's government .
" the opening of the markets is key to paraguay development and its energy-generating capacity , " carlos mateo , itaipu-paraguay director , told the bbc .
the itaipu power plant is built on the parana river in the region known as the triple border .
it is not convenient for brazil to have a poor and powerless neighbour carlos mateo itaipu-paraguay director inaugurated in 1984 , its 20 generator units have an installed capacity of 14,000 megawatts of energy , some 90 % of which is used by brazil .
for many years , paraguay complained about some unfair aspects of a treaty signed in 1973 , when military governments ran both countries .
that treaty required paraguay to sell its unused electricity to brazil at a fixed price until the treaty expires in 2023 .
in return , brazil would pay paraguay a lump sum in compensation which today amounts to $ 124 million a year .
" the deal was always considered unfair by paraguayans , especially when you think that paraguay and brazil paid for the dam equally , " says itaipu paraguayan council member carlos alberto gonzalez , a respected lawyer and former ambassador to brazil .
" each of the countries invested $ 100 million initially and the rest of the money came from loans . "
growing debt many in brazil feel that paraguayan claims are out of place , particularly as they believe brazil paid for the dam alone .
this is untrue , mr gonzalez says , because brazil only acted as a guarantor for the initial loans used to build the dam , but these loans are being paid with funds generated by itaipu energy sales .
matters were made worse in 1985 , when paraguay agreed to brazil 's request to sell itaipu 's electricity below market prices in order to fight an economic crisis in brazil .
during four years itaipu lost $ 4 for each megawatt of the electricity it produced .
this continuous loss led to a debt that paraguayan authorities deem illegal .
the main creditor for this debt is electrobras , the state-owned brazilian electricity company and main itaipu electricity buyer .
this matter was not addressed in the most recent agreement .
in spite of industrial growth elsewhere in the region , in the last 25 years paraguay has only increased its share in the use of itaipu electricity from 2 % to 10 % .
the country also failed to attract significant investments for electro-intensive industries because of its old transmission lines .
" the lines are obsolete , " says carlos mateo , itaipu-paraguay director .
" we lose about 40 % of the electricity in transmission .
about 25 % is lost as a result of overload and 15 % is stolen with illegal connections . "
the new deal signed with brazil also contemplates building a powerful electricity line to the capital .
what we did today is a demonstration that both countries are 100 % committed to discuss any issues that can improve the life of our people brazilian president lula this line will be completed in the year 2012 and will be fully paid by itaipu .
many may wonder why brazil changed its attitude towards paraguay after so many years of denying the possibility of reviewing the original arrangements .
personal loyalties ?
some think it may have to do with president lula 's personal sympathy towards former bishop fernando lugo , who won elections in paraguay last year after 60 years of rule by the colorado party .
but it may also have to do with brazil 's new concept of leadership in the region .
" leadership comes with responsibility and lula has incorporated paraguay in his concept of social inclusion , " says dr mateo .
" it is not convenient for brazil to have a poor and powerless neighbour . "

i wrote down a list of the questions i wanted to ask him .
i wanted to ask him about his connections with shropshire as i waited nervously in the reception area of his somerset nursing home .
i was warned even at that stage that harry , who was then 109 , may not want to talk .
i was about to meet the last surviving veteran to fight in the trenches in world war i. wwi veteran patch dies aged 111 then the moment came .
a member of staff popped her head around the corner and took me through to meet harry .
he was sitting in the dining room with his medals proudly displayed on his jacket .
we shook hands and he gave me a big smile .
i ca n't remember exactly what i was thinking but i knew i had just shaken hands with somebody who fought , maybe alongside my relatives , during wwi .
we moved into a private room and harry was wheeled through in his wheelchair .
i did n't know what to expect but he soon made me feel at ease .
by this stage harry had been interviewed many times over the last few years by journalists like me , yet he was still willing to tell his story .
i decided i did n't want to go straight into the interview by asking him about the war , mainly because there 's so much more to harry than that .
we chatted about his connections with shropshire .
harry met his first wife , ada in sutton coldfield : " she was coming down some steps from the cinema -lrb- i was -rrb- rushing for a bus ... i ran into her , knocked her down .
i took her home ...
then met her the next night . "
ada was originally from hadley in telford and soon the couple married at holy trinity church in wellington in 1919 .
from there they went on their honey moon to church stretton before settling for a short time in the county .
harry also spoke about his love of the wrekin which he had climbed on many occasions .
we then moved on to talk about his experiences of fighting in the war .
as he spoke , i could tell that he found it difficult talking about the subject .
at one stage he talked about the time he saw a soldier 's body in no man 's land , as he started to describe what he saw , he then went quiet and we quickly changed the subject .
i then asked him about what his life was like after the war , but i could tell he was still thinking about the soldier in the shell hole .
we did get back onto the subject of the war and harry talked about trench life .
the mud , the water , the cat-sized rats and the stench .
harry did n't see the end of the war , he survived an explosion which killed three of his friends in the same machine gun crew .
he told me about the haunting memory that still occupied his mind - a soldier standing in full battle dress next to a grave .
looking into his eyes i could only imagine what he saw on the wwi battlefields .
i thought , here is a man who was lucky to survive the war and now he is the only surviving soldier who fought in the trenches .
and now with his death , it means wwi is truly consigned to history .
a generation has now passed , but we must thank harry not only for his sacrifice in fighting , but having the courage to talk about his experiences .
it is important to remember the sacrifice they all made and with his recollections we can now make sure their memories will live on for ever .

more than 5,500 people got anti-viral drugs on day one of the flu line , which the government said was " working well " .
meanwhile the health secretary has said undue anxiety about the mostly mild virus could put strain on the nhs .
in a report due out on tuesday , peers on the science and technology committee are expected to say ministers failed to follow their own timetable for informing and advising the public in the event of a pandemic .
the committee had recommended in 2005 - when it was looking at a possible bird flu pandemic - that the government should ensure it had adequate and prompt systems for providing information to the public .

health secretary andy burnham told sunday 's observer that the government had been planning its response to a pandemic for a long time , and that it was important people should keep a sense of perspective about the illness .
he told the newspaper : " it has been a mild virus in the vast majority of cases , with relatively mild symptoms from which people recover fully fairly quickly .
" if people are made unnecessarily anxious , it makes the lives of nhs professionals , who are already under enormous pressure , far more difficult as people become unduly worried . "

more than 58,000 assessments were completed on the first day , 89 % of them online .
among the symptoms listed are fever or temperature over 38c or 100.4f , coupled with two of the following : unusual tiredness , headache , runny nose , sore throat , shortness of breath or cough , loss of appetite , aching muscles , diarrhoea or vomiting .
if patients are diagnosed with the virus , they are issued with a unique reference number which must be given when the drugs are collected .
however , patients are still being advised to contact gps if they have serious underlying illnesses , are pregnant , have sick children aged under one , their condition suddenly worsens or continues to worsen after seven days - five for a child .
more than 100,000 people in the uk are estimated to have caught swine flu in the past week alone .
some 30 people have died after contracting the illness .

the service for england was launched on thursday but a house of lords report is to attack ministers for not following their own timetable for pandemics .
more than 5,500 people got anti-viral drugs on day one of the flu line , which the government said was " working well " .
meanwhile the health secretary has said undue anxiety about the mostly mild virus could put strain on the nhs .
in a report due out on tuesday , peers on the science and technology committee are expected to say ministers failed to follow their own timetable for informing and advising the public in the event of a pandemic .
the committee had recommended in 2005 - when it was looking at a possible bird flu pandemic - that the government should ensure it had adequate and prompt systems for providing information to the public .
if people are made unnecessarily anxious , it makes the lives of nhs professionals , who are already under enormous pressure , far more difficult health secretary andy burnham send us your comments a whitehall source told the bbc 's political correspondent reeta chakrabarti that peers would be critical that the national flu pandemic service hotline was only launched last week .
health secretary andy burnham told sunday 's observer that the government had been planning its response to a pandemic for a long time , and that it was important people should keep a sense of perspective about the illness .
he told the newspaper : " it has been a mild virus in the vast majority of cases , with relatively mild symptoms from which people recover fully fairly quickly .
" if people are made unnecessarily anxious , it makes the lives of nhs professionals , who are already under enormous pressure , far more difficult as people become unduly worried . "
speaking on the bbc 's andrew marr show , conservative leader david cameron welcomed the fact that the hotline was now up and running but warned that the number of critical care beds available was " very low compared to other countries " .
self diagnosis the national flu pandemic service telephone hotline and website were launched so patients could obtain treatment without a gp 's prescription .
when it went online there were reports of it receiving 2,600 hits a second , or 9.3m an hour .
people who think they have swine flu can complete a questionnaire online or over the telephone .
more than 58,000 assessments were completed on the first day , 89 % of them online .
among the symptoms listed are fever or temperature over 38c or 100.4f , coupled with two of the following : unusual tiredness , headache , runny nose , sore throat , shortness of breath or cough , loss of appetite , aching muscles , diarrhoea or vomiting .
if patients are diagnosed with the virus , they are issued with a unique reference number which must be given when the drugs are collected .
however , patients are still being advised to contact gps if they have serious underlying illnesses , are pregnant , have sick children aged under one , their condition suddenly worsens or continues to worsen after seven days - five for a child .
more than 100,000 people in the uk are estimated to have caught swine flu in the past week alone .
some 30 people have died after contracting the illness .

alistair darling : ' there is a fight to be had ' chancellor alistair darling has said he believes labour " can and will win " the next election - but said labour had to " come out fighting " after the summer .
he told bbc one 's andrew marr show he was not a natural optimist but was confident despite labour 's heavy defeat in this week 's by-election .
earlier gordon brown appealed for the party to show it was united .
tory leader david cameron told the same programme the scale of the " economic mess " was " incredibly daunting " .
he said that while no-one in his party was complacent they were drawing up plans to sort out the economy which would see everyone " paying their fair share " .
mr darling said : " whoever wins the next election will shape the destiny of this country - not just for the next five years , beyond that ...
i believe that we can win and we will win , but we really do need to come out fighting . "
asked by the presenter " even under gordon brown ? " , mr darling replied : " yes , absolutely . "
' incompetent ' the prime minister 's appeal for discipline in the labour party came after some mps attacked him over its by-election defeat in norwich north .
mr brown told the sunday mirror the party had to work hard over the summer to show it was disciplined and capable of running the country .
some senior labour mps have said mr brown was directly responsibility for the crushing defeat by the tories .
chloe smith , 27 , reversed a comfortable labour majority to win by 7,348 votes .
mr brown told the sunday mirror : " we 've got to show that we are a disciplined party getting on with the work of government .
it 's important you understand you have got to spend time with your children gordon brown " i think people are very clear that we 've got a task ahead .
we 've got work to do to prepare for the autumn . "
the by-election saw a swing from labour to the tories of 16.5 % as they garnered more than 13,500 votes .
a repeat in a general election would bring the conservatives to number 10 with a majority of more than 200 seats in the commons .
mr brown 's comments came amid renewed concerns about his leadership among labour backbenchers , who said he had until the party conference season in september to demonstrate he was up to the job .
ex-home secretary charles clarke blamed the norwich north result on mr brown 's " incompetent " treatment of outgoing mp dr ian gibson .
summer break senior backbencher barry sheerman said the result was a " self-inflicted wound " and warned mr brown had until the end of the summer to reconnect with voters .
left-winger john mcdonnell said the prime minister had made a " terrible miscalculation " in his handling of the episode .
and fellow labour backbencher , kate hoey , told the bbc mr brown needed to re-examine his leadership techniques .
she said : " by-elections are always unique but there is no doubt about it that this is a bad result . "
during his interview with the sunday mirror , mr brown also said he intended to spend more time with his children during the summer break from westminster .
he said : " if you are away for a week you notice how your children change and you have got to re-win their interest .
it 's important you understand you have got to spend time with your children . "
however mr brown also stressed that he would remain focused on the needs of the country .
