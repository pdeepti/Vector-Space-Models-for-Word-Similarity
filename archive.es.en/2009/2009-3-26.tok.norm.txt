czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .

in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .
nonetheless , he said imf officials would meet thursday in vienna with the 10 banks that do the most business in romania in an effort to convince them not to withdraw funding from their operations in the country .
eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .
the first 5-billion-euro funding injection could be headed to romania by early may .
ebrd chief calls for troubled nations to ask for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mirow wants countries to speak up about hardship the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- , thomas mirow , meanwhile told the financial times deutschland newspaper wednesday that troubled eastern european economies should seek help now rather than feed speculation about their problems .
" countries that think they need international monetary fund help should turn quickly to the imf , " he said .
" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "
in a statement , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said the deal was subject to approval by the fund 's executive board , which would meet " in the coming weeks " to discuss the stand-by arrangement . nda / afp / dpa / reuters / ftd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .

next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .

franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .

franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .

the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .

" countries that think they need international monetary fund help should turn quickly to the imf , " he said .
" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "
in a statement , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said the deal was subject to approval by the fund 's executive board , which would meet " in the coming weeks " to discuss the stand-by arrangement . nda / afp / dpa / reuters / ftd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "

many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .

many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision comes after moves by the us administration toward a more friendly relationship with the islamic republic . an iranian official said thursday , march 26 , that tehran will take part in a united nations conference on the future of afghanistan to be held in the hague next week .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , one of the main instigators behind the meeting , is also expected to attend . iranian foreign minister hassan qashqavi confirmed tehran would send a representative to the meeting but added that " the level of participation is not clear . " the us state department said there were no plans for a " substantive " meeting between clinton and the iranian representative at the conference . " this conference is about reaching a regional consensus about afghanistan , " state department spokesman gordon duguid said . " it is not a conference about us-iranian relations . " the talks will be hosted by afghanistan , the netherlands and the united nations and opened by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
the 80 countries and 20 international organizations attending are expected to focus on security and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan where nato and us troops face the growing threat of a taliban insurgency .
the united states is also set to present a review of its policy in afghanistan and pakistan . a two-way approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is concerned iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said iran 's involvement showed that efforts by europe and the us to improve relations have had an effect .
iran sat out a similar meeting in france last december . she said the eu and united states have promoted a two-track policy toward tehran . " one track is sanctions to ensure a more cooperative behavior , " verhagen said .
" -lrb- the other -rrb- way is to offer a positive package if they cooperate .
i think this participation of iran in an international conference fits also within this two-way approach . " news of iran 's participation comes one week after us president barack obama offered a " new beginning " in the diplomatic relationship between iran and the us in a televised address released to broadcasters in the middle east .
in another overture to iran , clinton called earlier this month for it to be invited to attend the meeting diplomatic ties between tehran and washington have been frosty for three decades . the us , along with the eu , has accused iran of pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
iran has consistently maintained its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . but analysts have said the two countries share an interest in a stable afghanistan . " we believe that a regional solution should be found for the afghanistan crisis , " the semi-official fars news agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as saying .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .

south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .

dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police admitted on thursday that they were chasing a phantom killer when swab sticks used for testing were found to be contaminated . one of germany 's most wanted criminals may not even exist .
investigators who found dna traces of a mystery woman suspected of committing at least three murders and numerous break-ins over the past 16 years , admitted on thursday , march 26 , they might have been chasing a phantom . the first dna trace from the female suspect turned up at the scene of a murder in may 1993 . later her dna fingerprint matched the 2001 killing of a 61-year-old man and the cold-blooded murder of a 22-year-old policewoman in heilbronn , a small german town north of stuttgart two years ago . the heilbronn case had led to a police investigation that consumed thousands of man hours , but the trail was as cold as ever before . " phantom of heilbronn " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton swab sticks used for dna testing were contaminated the unknown female suspect , dubbed " the phantom of heilbronn , " was never seen at the scene of any of the crimes .
police investigators have said they suspected that she could be homeless , a drug addict or even an itinerant used car dealer . the police went on a widely publicized television appeal offering a bounty of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- for evidence leading to her arrest , but no one came forward . the dna trail had led to 40 different locations in southwest germany , france and austria , with the last genetic fingerprint of the " phantom " found on march 18 in a school in the western german state of saarland . police started to become suspicious when they looked into the case of a missing male asylum-seeker , who was believed to have perished in a fire several weeks ago .
the investigators found dna traces of the female " phantom " in the asylum seeker 's file .
a new dna sample was taken from the fingerprint card and the " phantom " woman 's dna trace disappeared . after watching the woman 's dna disappear , investigators began to consider the possibility that the cotton swabs used to collect the dna were contaminated with the " phantom 's " dna before they were used at crime scenes . at a press conference in heilbronn on thursday , the local public prosecutor and police from the german states of baden-wuerttemberg and saarland admitted that they had been investigating the possibility of contamination since april 2008 . " an unknown person could have come into contact with the swabs , while they were being manufactured , packaged or delivered , " said bernd meiners a spokesman for the public prosecutor in the western city of saarbruecken . additional contamination likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microscopic human cells can easily contaminate the swabs police in baden-wuerttemberg have analyzed hundreds of unused swab sticks but have so far found nothing .
but they say it is possible other batches were also contaminated . according to germany 's stern magazine , which broke the story that the police could have been chasing a phantom , the swab sticks were put through the proper sterilization procedures , but they could have still become contaminated from human cells in the form of skin particles , sweat , saliva or other bodily secretions . in the meantime , female packers who work for the german company that supplies the swab sticks have given the authorities samples of their saliva to check whether the phantom 's dna is a match . police are also now testing the presumably sterile swabs used to collect evidence for contamination .
new examinations of cotton swabs showed all likelihood of contamination said ulrich goll , justice minister in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where police are spearheading the investigation . " something like this should not have happened , " said the minister , who defended the police and forensic experts responsible for collecting the samples .

the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .
more answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid el-masri says cia agents abducted him and transported him to afghanistan according to news agency afp , the free democratic party announced it is considering asking former defense minister peter struck , a member of the social democrats , to explain whether or not he took part in the nato decision to abduct terror suspects .
that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .
although there has never been any proof of german involvement , warrants issued in germany for the arrest of the cia agents involved in the capture of el-masri were blocked by the german government .
additionally , when the then interior minister , otto schilly , was informed by the us of el-masri 's abduction , he did n't inform the public prosecutor . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .

unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .
the afghanistan mission is germany 's first major operation since the end of world war ii .
it was and remains unpopular .
merkel is up for re-election .
a forsa opinion survey released this week found that 58 percent of germans want their troops to come home while only 36 percent are in favor of a continued german presence there .
plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .
trust between the kremlin and the alliance " must be solidified , " the chancellor said .
the chancellor and russian president dmitry medvedev are scheduled to meet in berlin next week .
merkel also highlighted the role nato had played in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .
" we even went on a picnic one day . " the choir also performs in other prisons regularly , as part of various cultural exchanges . the penitentiary in targsor is now a far cry from what it used to be : a place which the communist authorities used to re-educate students who opposed the dictatorial regime . today , the only problem detainees have is time dragging on too slowly .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .

despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de toppling of czech leader raises concerns over eu presidency mirek topolanek will likely serve out the term of his country 's eu presidency , but the bloc 's politicians are worried about the legitimacy of a leader ousted by his own government and the fate of the lisbon treaty .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , " she said .
unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .
the afghanistan mission is germany 's first major operation since the end of world war ii .
it was and remains unpopular .
merkel is up for re-election .
a forsa opinion survey released this week found that 58 percent of germans want their troops to come home while only 36 percent are in favor of a continued german presence there .
plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .
trust between the kremlin and the alliance " must be solidified , " the chancellor said .
the chancellor and russian president dmitry medvedev are scheduled to meet in berlin next week .
merkel also highlighted the role nato had played in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "

many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .

czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .

what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .

south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .

two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "

many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .

belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .

in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .
there are nine nuclear powers in the world today .

us secretary of state hillary clinton , one of the main instigators behind the meeting , is also expected to attend . iranian foreign minister hassan qashqavi confirmed tehran would send a representative to the meeting but added that " the level of participation is not clear . " the us state department said there were no plans for a " substantive " meeting between clinton and the iranian representative at the conference . " this conference is about reaching a regional consensus about afghanistan , " state department spokesman gordon duguid said . " it is not a conference about us-iranian relations . " the talks will be hosted by afghanistan , the netherlands and the united nations and opened by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
the 80 countries and 20 international organizations attending are expected to focus on security and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan where nato and us troops face the growing threat of a taliban insurgency .
the united states is also set to present a review of its policy in afghanistan and pakistan . a two-way approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is concerned iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said iran 's involvement showed that efforts by europe and the us to improve relations have had an effect .

" -lrb- the other -rrb- way is to offer a positive package if they cooperate .
i think this participation of iran in an international conference fits also within this two-way approach . " news of iran 's participation comes one week after us president barack obama offered a " new beginning " in the diplomatic relationship between iran and the us in a televised address released to broadcasters in the middle east .
in another overture to iran , clinton called earlier this month for it to be invited to attend the meeting diplomatic ties between tehran and washington have been frosty for three decades . the us , along with the eu , has accused iran of pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
iran has consistently maintained its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . but analysts have said the two countries share an interest in a stable afghanistan . " we believe that a regional solution should be found for the afghanistan crisis , " the semi-official fars news agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as saying .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .
although there has never been any proof of german involvement , warrants issued in germany for the arrest of the cia agents involved in the capture of el-masri were blocked by the german government .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .

south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .

next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .

plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .
the first 5-billion-euro funding injection could be headed to romania by early may .

" countries that think they need international monetary fund help should turn quickly to the imf , " he said .
" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "
in a statement , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said the deal was subject to approval by the fund 's executive board , which would meet " in the coming weeks " to discuss the stand-by arrangement . nda / afp / dpa / reuters / ftd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .

" countries that think they need international monetary fund help should turn quickly to the imf , " he said .
" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "
in a statement , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said the deal was subject to approval by the fund 's executive board , which would meet " in the coming weeks " to discuss the stand-by arrangement . nda / afp / dpa / reuters / ftd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police admitted on thursday that they were chasing a phantom killer when swab sticks used for testing were found to be contaminated . one of germany 's most wanted criminals may not even exist .
investigators who found dna traces of a mystery woman suspected of committing at least three murders and numerous break-ins over the past 16 years , admitted on thursday , march 26 , they might have been chasing a phantom . the first dna trace from the female suspect turned up at the scene of a murder in may 1993 . later her dna fingerprint matched the 2001 killing of a 61-year-old man and the cold-blooded murder of a 22-year-old policewoman in heilbronn , a small german town north of stuttgart two years ago . the heilbronn case had led to a police investigation that consumed thousands of man hours , but the trail was as cold as ever before . " phantom of heilbronn " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton swab sticks used for dna testing were contaminated the unknown female suspect , dubbed " the phantom of heilbronn , " was never seen at the scene of any of the crimes .
police investigators have said they suspected that she could be homeless , a drug addict or even an itinerant used car dealer . the police went on a widely publicized television appeal offering a bounty of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- for evidence leading to her arrest , but no one came forward . the dna trail had led to 40 different locations in southwest germany , france and austria , with the last genetic fingerprint of the " phantom " found on march 18 in a school in the western german state of saarland . police started to become suspicious when they looked into the case of a missing male asylum-seeker , who was believed to have perished in a fire several weeks ago .
the investigators found dna traces of the female " phantom " in the asylum seeker 's file .
a new dna sample was taken from the fingerprint card and the " phantom " woman 's dna trace disappeared . after watching the woman 's dna disappear , investigators began to consider the possibility that the cotton swabs used to collect the dna were contaminated with the " phantom 's " dna before they were used at crime scenes . at a press conference in heilbronn on thursday , the local public prosecutor and police from the german states of baden-wuerttemberg and saarland admitted that they had been investigating the possibility of contamination since april 2008 . " an unknown person could have come into contact with the swabs , while they were being manufactured , packaged or delivered , " said bernd meiners a spokesman for the public prosecutor in the western city of saarbruecken . additional contamination likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microscopic human cells can easily contaminate the swabs police in baden-wuerttemberg have analyzed hundreds of unused swab sticks but have so far found nothing .
but they say it is possible other batches were also contaminated . according to germany 's stern magazine , which broke the story that the police could have been chasing a phantom , the swab sticks were put through the proper sterilization procedures , but they could have still become contaminated from human cells in the form of skin particles , sweat , saliva or other bodily secretions . in the meantime , female packers who work for the german company that supplies the swab sticks have given the authorities samples of their saliva to check whether the phantom 's dna is a match . police are also now testing the presumably sterile swabs used to collect evidence for contamination .
new examinations of cotton swabs showed all likelihood of contamination said ulrich goll , justice minister in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where police are spearheading the investigation .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .
more answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid el-masri says cia agents abducted him and transported him to afghanistan according to news agency afp , the free democratic party announced it is considering asking former defense minister peter struck , a member of the social democrats , to explain whether or not he took part in the nato decision to abduct terror suspects .
that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .
although there has never been any proof of german involvement , warrants issued in germany for the arrest of the cia agents involved in the capture of el-masri were blocked by the german government .
additionally , when the then interior minister , otto schilly , was informed by the us of el-masri 's abduction , he did n't inform the public prosecutor . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .

unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .
the afghanistan mission is germany 's first major operation since the end of world war ii .
it was and remains unpopular .
merkel is up for re-election .
a forsa opinion survey released this week found that 58 percent of germans want their troops to come home while only 36 percent are in favor of a continued german presence there .
plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .
trust between the kremlin and the alliance " must be solidified , " the chancellor said .
the chancellor and russian president dmitry medvedev are scheduled to meet in berlin next week .
merkel also highlighted the role nato had played in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .

the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .
nonetheless , he said imf officials would meet thursday in vienna with the 10 banks that do the most business in romania in an effort to convince them not to withdraw funding from their operations in the country .
eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .
the first 5-billion-euro funding injection could be headed to romania by early may .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .
nonetheless , he said imf officials would meet thursday in vienna with the 10 banks that do the most business in romania in an effort to convince them not to withdraw funding from their operations in the country .
eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .

" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .

morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .

unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , " she said .
unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trans-atlantic relations -pipe- 26.03.2009 czech leader 's ' hell ' remark fans flames of eu-us dissent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us missteps are the " way to hell " , said the czech pm in strasbourg .
czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de toppling of czech leader raises concerns over eu presidency mirek topolanek will likely serve out the term of his country 's eu presidency , but the bloc 's politicians are worried about the legitimacy of a leader ousted by his own government and the fate of the lisbon treaty .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .

it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

the decision comes after moves by the us administration toward a more friendly relationship with the islamic republic . an iranian official said thursday , march 26 , that tehran will take part in a united nations conference on the future of afghanistan to be held in the hague next week .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , one of the main instigators behind the meeting , is also expected to attend . iranian foreign minister hassan qashqavi confirmed tehran would send a representative to the meeting but added that " the level of participation is not clear . " the us state department said there were no plans for a " substantive " meeting between clinton and the iranian representative at the conference . " this conference is about reaching a regional consensus about afghanistan , " state department spokesman gordon duguid said . " it is not a conference about us-iranian relations . " the talks will be hosted by afghanistan , the netherlands and the united nations and opened by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
the 80 countries and 20 international organizations attending are expected to focus on security and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan where nato and us troops face the growing threat of a taliban insurgency .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .

the decision comes after moves by the us administration toward a more friendly relationship with the islamic republic . an iranian official said thursday , march 26 , that tehran will take part in a united nations conference on the future of afghanistan to be held in the hague next week .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , one of the main instigators behind the meeting , is also expected to attend . iranian foreign minister hassan qashqavi confirmed tehran would send a representative to the meeting but added that " the level of participation is not clear . " the us state department said there were no plans for a " substantive " meeting between clinton and the iranian representative at the conference . " this conference is about reaching a regional consensus about afghanistan , " state department spokesman gordon duguid said . " it is not a conference about us-iranian relations . " the talks will be hosted by afghanistan , the netherlands and the united nations and opened by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .

but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .

czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he could choose to re-appoint topolanek , but has said that the new prime minister must be able to command a majority in parliament .

" perhaps nobody can question the role of ...
vaclav klaus in this game , " topolanek told czech public television on wednesday . the political crisis may also issue a deadly blow to czech-us treaties that allow the united states to place a missile defense radar base on czech soil . klaus , who will have to appoint a new premier , said he would prefer " a quick solution " to the crisis given the current economic downturn and the country 's international obligations . sms / mll / ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , " she said .
unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .
the afghanistan mission is germany 's first major operation since the end of world war ii .
it was and remains unpopular .
merkel is up for re-election .
a forsa opinion survey released this week found that 58 percent of germans want their troops to come home while only 36 percent are in favor of a continued german presence there .
plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .
trust between the kremlin and the alliance " must be solidified , " the chancellor said .
the chancellor and russian president dmitry medvedev are scheduled to meet in berlin next week .
merkel also highlighted the role nato had played in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .

he 's won ten caps for germany and judging by his current form , there 'll be plenty more to come .
one of his greatest assets is his versatility . even though he 's never played as a striker , he 's schalke 's second-best goalscorer this season .
originally brought in as a central defender , he 's also played on the left and the right .
at the moment , he 's being deployed in central and defensive midfield .
is it an advantage to be so versatile ?
for the team it 's very good when there 's a player that can play all positions .
on the other hand you ca n't be expected to play one position one week and another the next and always put in a top performance – that ’ s very difficult .
you said you prefer to play central defense ...
yes i do ... because i play most stable there .
if i play there several games in a row , i can play to my full potential without a dip in performance .
that 's highly unlikely for a player as consistent as heiko westermann .
at age 17 , he played for second-division greuther fürth .
five years later he moved to bielefeld .
in 2007 he signed for schalke and broke into the germany team at 25 .
is your success due to hard work or talent ?
there are players that are more talented than i am .
no doubt about it .
but i 've never let that get me down .
i 've always been aware of my strengths and have tried to work on them .
i 'm still doing that today .
i 'm also working on my weaknesses .
the important thing is to focus on improving your strengths .
could you say how much is talent and how much is hard work ?
i 'd say it 's about 70 percent hard work and 30 percent talent .
that 's enough to make it in football ?
yes it 's enough to do a lot in football .
if you really want it you can achieve a lot of things .
if only the same could be said for schalke .
they waste chances by the bucketload ; have put in some dismal performances ; and have failed to deliver on their supporters ' high expectations .
your coach has been jeered .
the commercial manager was fired .
some players have been booed .
how 's the team coping ?
if you look at the last few games – we have n't played outstanding football .
it was impossible because we lack the confidence other teams have .
it 's very , very difficult .
a slight rift has opened up between us and the fans .
we did n't applaud them after the last game because we were leading 1:0 and they started chanting for the coach to be fired .
we ca n't tolerate that as a team because that 's our coach .
we 're in a crisis – a sporting crisis – and we 're not denying that .
we 're also not denying that we 're playing poorly .
but when we start to win games we 'll start playing better football again .
do you think there are player deficiencies ?
kevin kuranyi is often singled out for criticism .
yes a lot of anger has been directed at him .
but he does n't play alone – that 's clear .
and he has missed a few chances – that 's also clear .
but he ca n't be blamed for everything .
you ca n't make him responsible for our failings .
if kevin represents the crisis does heiko westermann represent success at schalke ?
i hope ultimately the whole team will represent success .
the season is n't over yet .
we 're still right in the thick of it .
we want a european spot and that would go a long way to salvaging the season for us .
is there any one player at the moment who stands out and is driving the team on ?
there 's a few players , some of the older ones like marcelo bordon or mladen krstajic .
more recently there 's been jermaine jones who 's made huge strides .
he works really hard and plays at full throttle for 90 minutes .
those are the players the rest of the team should look toward and maybe that would get us back on track .
do your take your work worries home with you ?
it depends .
when we lose at weekends then i 'm normally down for a day and i do n't want to talk to anyone about football .
i just want to have my peace and quiet that 's all .
you 've also been working hard off the pitch .
you 've been visiting a kinetics specialist ...
yes it 's special training where you have to be totally focused for an hour .
you work a lot with your brain and you 're exhausted afterwards .
it 's basically stress-resistance training .
if you 're subject to a lot of stress in a short period of time , it helps you get an overview of the situation and not get hectic when the heat 's on .
how does a movement specialist help you reduce stress ?
the aim is to do several things at once using your mind , your legs and your feet .
do you do anything else to become a better footballer ?
yes i try to make it part of my life .
i 'm not preaching to anyone but i try to eat healthily and get plenty of sleep . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the moment , he 's being deployed in central and defensive midfield .
is it an advantage to be so versatile ?
for the team it 's very good when there 's a player that can play all positions .
on the other hand you ca n't be expected to play one position one week and another the next and always put in a top performance – that ’ s very difficult .
you said you prefer to play central defense ...
yes i do ... because i play most stable there .
if i play there several games in a row , i can play to my full potential without a dip in performance .
that 's highly unlikely for a player as consistent as heiko westermann .
at age 17 , he played for second-division greuther fürth .
five years later he moved to bielefeld .
in 2007 he signed for schalke and broke into the germany team at 25 .
is your success due to hard work or talent ?
there are players that are more talented than i am .
no doubt about it .
but i 've never let that get me down .
i 've always been aware of my strengths and have tried to work on them .
i 'm still doing that today .
i 'm also working on my weaknesses .
the important thing is to focus on improving your strengths .
could you say how much is talent and how much is hard work ?
i 'd say it 's about 70 percent hard work and 30 percent talent .
that 's enough to make it in football ?
yes it 's enough to do a lot in football .
if you really want it you can achieve a lot of things .
if only the same could be said for schalke .
they waste chances by the bucketload ; have put in some dismal performances ; and have failed to deliver on their supporters ' high expectations .
your coach has been jeered .
the commercial manager was fired .
some players have been booed .
how 's the team coping ?
if you look at the last few games – we have n't played outstanding football .
it was impossible because we lack the confidence other teams have .
it 's very , very difficult .
a slight rift has opened up between us and the fans .
we did n't applaud them after the last game because we were leading 1:0 and they started chanting for the coach to be fired .
we ca n't tolerate that as a team because that 's our coach .
we 're in a crisis – a sporting crisis – and we 're not denying that .
we 're also not denying that we 're playing poorly .
but when we start to win games we 'll start playing better football again .
do you think there are player deficiencies ?
kevin kuranyi is often singled out for criticism .
yes a lot of anger has been directed at him .
but he does n't play alone – that 's clear .
and he has missed a few chances – that 's also clear .
but he ca n't be blamed for everything .
you ca n't make him responsible for our failings .
if kevin represents the crisis does heiko westermann represent success at schalke ?
i hope ultimately the whole team will represent success .
the season is n't over yet .
we 're still right in the thick of it .
we want a european spot and that would go a long way to salvaging the season for us .
is there any one player at the moment who stands out and is driving the team on ?
there 's a few players , some of the older ones like marcelo bordon or mladen krstajic .
more recently there 's been jermaine jones who 's made huge strides .
he works really hard and plays at full throttle for 90 minutes .
those are the players the rest of the team should look toward and maybe that would get us back on track .
do your take your work worries home with you ?
it depends .
when we lose at weekends then i 'm normally down for a day and i do n't want to talk to anyone about football .
i just want to have my peace and quiet that 's all .
you 've also been working hard off the pitch .
you 've been visiting a kinetics specialist ...
yes it 's special training where you have to be totally focused for an hour .
you work a lot with your brain and you 're exhausted afterwards .
it 's basically stress-resistance training .
if you 're subject to a lot of stress in a short period of time , it helps you get an overview of the situation and not get hectic when the heat 's on .
how does a movement specialist help you reduce stress ?
the aim is to do several things at once using your mind , your legs and your feet .
do you do anything else to become a better footballer ?
yes i try to make it part of my life .
i 'm not preaching to anyone but i try to eat healthily and get plenty of sleep . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 26.03.2009 no progress in thailand ’ s rights situation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rights activists say police reform in thailand will help prevent rights abuses us-based human right watch says for thailand to show real signs of progress in advancing human rights , the government should take steps to prosecute human rights ' abusers , especially those from the state security or police forces . human rights watch says thailand ’ s human rights performance is showing few signs of progress despite greater willingness by the thai government to debate the issue .
brad adams , human rights watch ’ s asia director , says the right ’ s group wants to see prosecutions of rights abusers to show real signs of progress , given a backlog of rights abuses over recent years .
“ there are so many cases , whether it ’ s the war on drugs during -lrb- prime minister -rrb- thaksin -lrb- shinawatra ’ s -rrb- period , whether it ’ s attacks on human rights defenders , whether its violence in the south – there are so many cases – where the evidence is quite clear- where the government with the political will could ensure prosecutions start . ”
government ’ s failure to tackle rights issues adams says a major disappointment over recent years was the failure in the development of the national human rights commission , which itself was undermined by political interference .
" the nhrc in thailand has been a huge disappointment , " says adams .
" it had built up a certain level of competence – mostly bureaucratic competence in the years before thaksin came to power .
it was on the path towards becoming a serious institution .
and since thaksin came in -lrb- in 2001 -rrb- it has essentially imploded .
the current commission does no serious work . "
a key focus of human rights watch ’ s work in thailand has been the insurgency in southern thailand ’ s largely muslim dominated provinces .
over the past five-years , strife has claimed more than 3,500 people .
the group says there has been a " failure to address local resentment and frustration over abuses by security forces and injustice " .
police and judicial reforms adams says besides prosecutions there also needs to be reform of the judiciary , the police and prosecutors ' office .
" if they are not overhauled in a way that they become professionally competent , corruption is addressed and they have political independence , we won ’ t see any systematic changes here . "
human rights watch also pointed to thailand ’ s widening political polarisation that led to protracted protests and deadly clashes last year .
in october , thai border patrol police opened fire with tear gas canisters on protestors opposing the pro-thaksin government during a demonstration outside the parliament .
one person died and hundreds injured , including police .
thailand ’ s political divide was evident again thursday when up to 30,000 pro-thaksin supporters , wearing the distinctive ‘ red shirts ’ , besieged the main government administration building calling on the government of prime minister abhisit to resign .
the protesters were also calling for the removal of foreign minister kasit piromya , for the parliament to be dissolved for fresh general elections and the prosecution of people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- key leaders , who led protests to close down bangkok 's airports last year . ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- 26/03/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : doing time in europe interview : raising awareness on prison conditions britain suffering from prison overcrowding the prison everyone wants to stay in fashion is helping italian prisoners ' futures europe -pipe- 26.03.2009 romanian prison choir enables whiff of freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music gives the inmates solace the women in targsor prison are offered a wide range of leisure activities .
but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .

brad adams , human rights watch ’ s asia director , says the right ’ s group wants to see prosecutions of rights abusers to show real signs of progress , given a backlog of rights abuses over recent years .
“ there are so many cases , whether it ’ s the war on drugs during -lrb- prime minister -rrb- thaksin -lrb- shinawatra ’ s -rrb- period , whether it ’ s attacks on human rights defenders , whether its violence in the south – there are so many cases – where the evidence is quite clear- where the government with the political will could ensure prosecutions start . ”
government ’ s failure to tackle rights issues adams says a major disappointment over recent years was the failure in the development of the national human rights commission , which itself was undermined by political interference .
" the nhrc in thailand has been a huge disappointment , " says adams .
" it had built up a certain level of competence – mostly bureaucratic competence in the years before thaksin came to power .
it was on the path towards becoming a serious institution .
and since thaksin came in -lrb- in 2001 -rrb- it has essentially imploded .
the current commission does no serious work . "
a key focus of human rights watch ’ s work in thailand has been the insurgency in southern thailand ’ s largely muslim dominated provinces .
over the past five-years , strife has claimed more than 3,500 people .
the group says there has been a " failure to address local resentment and frustration over abuses by security forces and injustice " .
police and judicial reforms adams says besides prosecutions there also needs to be reform of the judiciary , the police and prosecutors ' office .
" if they are not overhauled in a way that they become professionally competent , corruption is addressed and they have political independence , we won ’ t see any systematic changes here . "
human rights watch also pointed to thailand ’ s widening political polarisation that led to protracted protests and deadly clashes last year .
in october , thai border patrol police opened fire with tear gas canisters on protestors opposing the pro-thaksin government during a demonstration outside the parliament .
one person died and hundreds injured , including police .
thailand ’ s political divide was evident again thursday when up to 30,000 pro-thaksin supporters , wearing the distinctive ‘ red shirts ’ , besieged the main government administration building calling on the government of prime minister abhisit to resign .
the protesters were also calling for the removal of foreign minister kasit piromya , for the parliament to be dissolved for fresh general elections and the prosecution of people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- key leaders , who led protests to close down bangkok 's airports last year . ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- 26/03/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 05 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , " she said .
unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .
next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .
" we can be satisfied with our performance , " said the chancellor , who faces re-election in september .
the afghanistan mission is germany 's first major operation since the end of world war ii .
it was and remains unpopular .
merkel is up for re-election .
a forsa opinion survey released this week found that 58 percent of germans want their troops to come home while only 36 percent are in favor of a continued german presence there .
plans for conference the 26 member states attending the summit are also expected to discuss nato 's eastward expansion and its relationship with russia .
trust between the kremlin and the alliance " must be solidified , " the chancellor said .
the chancellor and russian president dmitry medvedev are scheduled to meet in berlin next week .
merkel also highlighted the role nato had played in the reconstruction of germany after world war ii .

the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .

the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .

that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .
although there has never been any proof of german involvement , warrants issued in germany for the arrest of the cia agents involved in the capture of el-masri were blocked by the german government .

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .

police investigators have said they suspected that she could be homeless , a drug addict or even an itinerant used car dealer . the police went on a widely publicized television appeal offering a bounty of 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 407,000 -rrb- for evidence leading to her arrest , but no one came forward . the dna trail had led to 40 different locations in southwest germany , france and austria , with the last genetic fingerprint of the " phantom " found on march 18 in a school in the western german state of saarland . police started to become suspicious when they looked into the case of a missing male asylum-seeker , who was believed to have perished in a fire several weeks ago .
the investigators found dna traces of the female " phantom " in the asylum seeker 's file .
a new dna sample was taken from the fingerprint card and the " phantom " woman 's dna trace disappeared . after watching the woman 's dna disappear , investigators began to consider the possibility that the cotton swabs used to collect the dna were contaminated with the " phantom 's " dna before they were used at crime scenes . at a press conference in heilbronn on thursday , the local public prosecutor and police from the german states of baden-wuerttemberg and saarland admitted that they had been investigating the possibility of contamination since april 2008 . " an unknown person could have come into contact with the swabs , while they were being manufactured , packaged or delivered , " said bernd meiners a spokesman for the public prosecutor in the western city of saarbruecken . additional contamination likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microscopic human cells can easily contaminate the swabs police in baden-wuerttemberg have analyzed hundreds of unused swab sticks but have so far found nothing .
but they say it is possible other batches were also contaminated . according to germany 's stern magazine , which broke the story that the police could have been chasing a phantom , the swab sticks were put through the proper sterilization procedures , but they could have still become contaminated from human cells in the form of skin particles , sweat , saliva or other bodily secretions . in the meantime , female packers who work for the german company that supplies the swab sticks have given the authorities samples of their saliva to check whether the phantom 's dna is a match . police are also now testing the presumably sterile swabs used to collect evidence for contamination .
new examinations of cotton swabs showed all likelihood of contamination said ulrich goll , justice minister in the state of baden-wuerttemberg , where police are spearheading the investigation . " something like this should not have happened , " said the minister , who defended the police and forensic experts responsible for collecting the samples .

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .

the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : doing time in europe interview : raising awareness on prison conditions britain suffering from prison overcrowding the prison everyone wants to stay in fashion is helping italian prisoners ' futures europe -pipe- 26.03.2009 romanian prison choir enables whiff of freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music gives the inmates solace the women in targsor prison are offered a wide range of leisure activities .
but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .
" we even went on a picnic one day . " the choir also performs in other prisons regularly , as part of various cultural exchanges . the penitentiary in targsor is now a far cry from what it used to be : a place which the communist authorities used to re-educate students who opposed the dictatorial regime . today , the only problem detainees have is time dragging on too slowly .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .

mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the south african government has admitted that it decided to bar the dalai lama because it did n't want to undermine relations with china .
a cabinet statement released late wednesday said that while south africa had not acted on a specific demand from beijing , it was not prepared to " jeopardize " ties nor allow itself to be used as a political platform in the run-up to the hosting of next year 's soccer world cup .
" a choice was made in this particular case that our interests will be better served if we give priority to making sure that we do n't jeopardise our bilateral relations with china in this particular case , " government spokesman themba maseko said in the statement .
dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .
" we even went on a picnic one day . " the choir also performs in other prisons regularly , as part of various cultural exchanges . the penitentiary in targsor is now a far cry from what it used to be : a place which the communist authorities used to re-educate students who opposed the dictatorial regime . today , the only problem detainees have is time dragging on too slowly .

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .

next week 's summit will be us president barack obama 's first visit to europe since taking office in january .
while he is expected to press nato allies for further support in afghanistan , merkel emphasized that germany would not increase its troop levels .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .
the eu itself is " fully united " ahead of the summit , she stressed . df / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de toppling of czech leader raises concerns over eu presidency mirek topolanek will likely serve out the term of his country 's eu presidency , but the bloc 's politicians are worried about the legitimacy of a leader ousted by his own government and the fate of the lisbon treaty .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .
there are nine nuclear powers in the world today .

brad adams , human rights watch ’ s asia director , says the right ’ s group wants to see prosecutions of rights abusers to show real signs of progress , given a backlog of rights abuses over recent years .
“ there are so many cases , whether it ’ s the war on drugs during -lrb- prime minister -rrb- thaksin -lrb- shinawatra ’ s -rrb- period , whether it ’ s attacks on human rights defenders , whether its violence in the south – there are so many cases – where the evidence is quite clear- where the government with the political will could ensure prosecutions start . ”
government ’ s failure to tackle rights issues adams says a major disappointment over recent years was the failure in the development of the national human rights commission , which itself was undermined by political interference .
" the nhrc in thailand has been a huge disappointment , " says adams .
" it had built up a certain level of competence – mostly bureaucratic competence in the years before thaksin came to power .
it was on the path towards becoming a serious institution .
and since thaksin came in -lrb- in 2001 -rrb- it has essentially imploded .
the current commission does no serious work . "
a key focus of human rights watch ’ s work in thailand has been the insurgency in southern thailand ’ s largely muslim dominated provinces .
over the past five-years , strife has claimed more than 3,500 people .
the group says there has been a " failure to address local resentment and frustration over abuses by security forces and injustice " .
police and judicial reforms adams says besides prosecutions there also needs to be reform of the judiciary , the police and prosecutors ' office .
" if they are not overhauled in a way that they become professionally competent , corruption is addressed and they have political independence , we won ’ t see any systematic changes here . "
human rights watch also pointed to thailand ’ s widening political polarisation that led to protracted protests and deadly clashes last year .
in october , thai border patrol police opened fire with tear gas canisters on protestors opposing the pro-thaksin government during a demonstration outside the parliament .
one person died and hundreds injured , including police .
thailand ’ s political divide was evident again thursday when up to 30,000 pro-thaksin supporters , wearing the distinctive ‘ red shirts ’ , besieged the main government administration building calling on the government of prime minister abhisit to resign .
the protesters were also calling for the removal of foreign minister kasit piromya , for the parliament to be dissolved for fresh general elections and the prosecution of people 's alliance for democracy -lrb- pad -rrb- key leaders , who led protests to close down bangkok 's airports last year . ron corben -lrb- bangkok -rrb- 26/03/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

brad adams , human rights watch ’ s asia director , says the right ’ s group wants to see prosecutions of rights abusers to show real signs of progress , given a backlog of rights abuses over recent years .
“ there are so many cases , whether it ’ s the war on drugs during -lrb- prime minister -rrb- thaksin -lrb- shinawatra ’ s -rrb- period , whether it ’ s attacks on human rights defenders , whether its violence in the south – there are so many cases – where the evidence is quite clear- where the government with the political will could ensure prosecutions start . ”
government ’ s failure to tackle rights issues adams says a major disappointment over recent years was the failure in the development of the national human rights commission , which itself was undermined by political interference .
" the nhrc in thailand has been a huge disappointment , " says adams .
" it had built up a certain level of competence – mostly bureaucratic competence in the years before thaksin came to power .
it was on the path towards becoming a serious institution .
and since thaksin came in -lrb- in 2001 -rrb- it has essentially imploded .
the current commission does no serious work . "
a key focus of human rights watch ’ s work in thailand has been the insurgency in southern thailand ’ s largely muslim dominated provinces .
over the past five-years , strife has claimed more than 3,500 people .
the group says there has been a " failure to address local resentment and frustration over abuses by security forces and injustice " .
police and judicial reforms adams says besides prosecutions there also needs to be reform of the judiciary , the police and prosecutors ' office .
" if they are not overhauled in a way that they become professionally competent , corruption is addressed and they have political independence , we won ’ t see any systematic changes here . "
human rights watch also pointed to thailand ’ s widening political polarisation that led to protracted protests and deadly clashes last year .
in october , thai border patrol police opened fire with tear gas canisters on protestors opposing the pro-thaksin government during a demonstration outside the parliament .
one person died and hundreds injured , including police .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .

if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .

but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .
" we even went on a picnic one day . " the choir also performs in other prisons regularly , as part of various cultural exchanges . the penitentiary in targsor is now a far cry from what it used to be : a place which the communist authorities used to re-educate students who opposed the dictatorial regime . today , the only problem detainees have is time dragging on too slowly .

the prime minister lost a no-confidence vote on tuesday . klaus , an outspoken critic of the eu and its reform lisbon treaty , will decide who will be the next premier and said a decision should be reached soon .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .

february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .

business confidence in europe 's largest economy has reached an all time low , but according to some economists , things could level out and even rebound in the coming months . business confidence in germany fell to its lowest point in 26 years this month , but there is a silver lining to this cloud as some economists are predicting that the end of the freefall could be in sight .
a survey released on wednesday by the munich-based ifo economic research institute indicated that the business confidence index in europe 's largest economy slipped in march by 0.5 points to 82.1 points .
february 's rating of 82.6 points was already the lowest business confidence has sunk since west germany and east germany were reunited in 1990 .
ifo surveyed 7,000 german companies in manufacturing , construction , wholesaling and retail to get their data .
" firms have reported a further worsening of their current business situation , " the institute said in a statement , adding that " an economic turning point has not yet been reached , in the opinion of the survey participants . "
economic optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ifo president hans-werner sinn says an economic turning point has not yet been reached while the march ifo indicator gauging current business conditions slumped from 84.3 points in february to 82.7 points , the index 's expectations component jumped for the third consecutive month from 80.9 to 81.6 .
many economists believe that the german economic slowdown could soon start to bottom out , opening up the chance of recovery after the implosion of america 's lehman brothers in september helped to send the world economy into a sharp decline in the last months of 2008 .
morgan stanley economist elga bartsch told news agency dpa that while the improved outlook is not strong enough to push the headline index higher , the continuing improvement in the survey 's forward looking component is good news .
" overall , however , these tentative signs of stabilization suggest to us that that after the sharp fall in activity over the winter , there is a good chance of a stabilization over the summer , " she added .
key surveys in fact , the release of this new survey by ifo comes on the heels of more positive readings from other economic surveys .
belgium 's business confidence survey , seen as a bellwether of the mood in the 16-member eurozone , unexpectedly rose to minus 28.6 points in march from minus 31.6 in february .
at the same time , the preliminary composite purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- for the eurozone , which draws together the manufacturing and services output indices , rose from 36.2 in february to 37.6 in march .
in addition , while concerns about current business conditions kept tuesday 's french business sentiment survey at record low levels in march , the paris-based national institute for statistics and economic studies -lrb- insee -rrb- report showed executives in france cautiously optimistic about the months ahead . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dalai lama 's response bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hosting the football world cup is seen as a major achievement for south africa the peace conference was meant to be a platform to discuss how to use soccer as a way to fight racism in the run up to the world cup which will be held in south africa in 2010 .
the dalai lama 's chief negotiator , lodi gyari , said china had only damaged its own attempts at closer ties with africa by pressuring south africa into refusing to allow the tibetan spiritual leader to enter the country .
according to the associated press , gyari , speaking at the heritage foundation , a washington think tank , said that the dalai lama himself felt sorry for indirectly causing the event 's disruption .
south africa 's health minister barbara hogan had also spoken out against the decision , calling on the government to apologize .
the cabinet statement slammed hogan , saying there would be consequences and that it was " unfortunate that the minister chose to go to a public platform to attack a decision of government . "
the meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archbishop desmond tutu -lrb- right -rrb- regards the dalai lama as a personal friend the decision to shelve the meeting indefinitely came after two of the nobel laureates invited - former south african president fw de klerk and archbishop desmond tutu - pulled out in protest at the government refusal to grant the visa .
among those who had planned to attend were queen rania of jordan , the entire nobel peace committee , other nobel laureates and the hollywood actress charlize theron , a native of south africa . mrm / mll / ap / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would mean rethinking strategy altogether , she said . " afghanistan is nato 's biggest test at present , " merkel told the german parliament on thursday , march 26 , just over a week before germany and france co-host a historic nato summit marking the 60th anniversary of the military and strategic alliance .
" for me our aim remains clear ... that afghanistan no longer poses a terrorist threat to our security , in other words in nato member countries , " merkel said .
success in afghanistan and elsewhere will require a rethinking of nato 's strategic concept , she said .
' revolutionary ' approach that means incorporating the " basic principle of networked security " - combining military action with efforts to stabilize those countries threatening the alliance , and strengthening ties with nongovernmental organizations , the african union , and the united nations .
" this may sound simple , but is comparatively revolutionary , " the chancellor said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently has some 3,500 troops in afghanistan " we should remember that afghanistan ... was the base for the attacks of september 11 , 2001 .
this was possible because there was no functioning state , and that was the reason for our engagement in afghanistan , " she said .
unpopular mission about 3,500 german troops are in afghanistan as part of the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
despite being based in the relatively peaceful north , 31 german troops have died in afghanistan since 2002 , including 14 during attacks .

marty was speaking on thursday before a special committee of the german parliament , set up to investigate the involvement of the german federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in america 's war on terror .
the swiss mp said that it was " absolutely incredible " that european governments had no knowledge of the activities carried out by the cia prior to 2005 .
he also finds it hard to believe that germany could have been isolated from these activities .
two events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss mp dick marty finds it difficult to believe that nato knew nothing of the flights prior to 2005 according to the german ard public broadcaster 's news website , there are two events that led marty to this conclusion .
the first was a meeting of the world 's most important secret service agencies in washington shortly after the attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon .
it was during this meeting that the cia informed their international counterparts that us president george w. bush had given them free range in deciding how to deal with terrorists .
the second happened just a month later when the nato countries agreed to support the us in the war on terror on october 4 , 2001 .
a statement released by nato at the time said that at the request of the united states the nato allies agreed to " take eight measures , individually and collectively , to expand the options available in the campaign against terrorism . "
two of those measures were " to enhance intelligence sharing and co-operation ... relating to the threats posed by terrorism " and to " provide blanket overflight clearances for the united states and other allies ' aircraft … for military flights related to operations against terrorism .
however , marty was unable to provide any physical evidence , saying that he got his information only after promising his sources that their identities would remain a secret .
more answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german khalid el-masri says cia agents abducted him and transported him to afghanistan according to news agency afp , the free democratic party announced it is considering asking former defense minister peter struck , a member of the social democrats , to explain whether or not he took part in the nato decision to abduct terror suspects .
that would include khaled el-masri , a german national , who was abducted by the cia in macedonia in 2004 and flown to afghanistan for interrogation on terrorism charges .
although there has never been any proof of german involvement , warrants issued in germany for the arrest of the cia agents involved in the capture of el-masri were blocked by the german government .
additionally , when the then interior minister , otto schilly , was informed by the us of el-masri 's abduction , he did n't inform the public prosecutor . mrm / mll / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .

of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .

czech pm mirek topolanek , who is also eu president , caused a flap when he said the us was on the " road to hell " with its spending plan .
the eu-us summit in prague on april 5 is likely to be business as usual , however . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who was also in strasbourg on wednesday in his double role as the eu 's current president , highlighted the transatlantic divide in handling the global economic crisis by calling us fiscal spending " the road to hell . " " not only does the us repeat the mistakes it made in the 1930s such as the tendency towards large stimulus -lrb- spending -rrb- , but calls for protectionism , such as the " buy american " campaign , " he said in a speech to the european parliament .
" all these steps , their combination , and what 's worse , an initiative for setting them up permanently , are the road to hell , " said topolanek , whose country is midway through the eu 's six month rotating presidency .
us-eu differences on stimulus spending topolanek had been voicing a concern about the different approaches taken by the euro zone 's european central bank and the us treasury to combat the global recession in the run-up to a g20 summit of world leaders in april .
washington is injecting trillions of dollars to prop up the banking system in order to pull the us out of its worst recession in decades .
the obama administration wants to commit 5.5 percent of us output to recovery efforts , whereas the eu has earmarked 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 543 billion -rrb- , which is equivalent to 3.3 percent of the 27 nation bloc 's gross domestic product for economic stimulus measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech pm 's ouster took place midway through prague 's eu stint .
czech vice prime minister alexandr vondra later tried to play down topolanek 's remarks , telling journalists in a news conference that his countryman did not say " hell . "
however an afp news service check of the original recording found that topolanek did indeed make the comment .
czech prime minister 's undiplomatic ways other european leaders , such as germany 's angela merkel have also said that the scale of us deficit spending that leads to inflation is not the solution to the eu 's problems , but it was the czech prime minister 's undiplomatic tone that raised hackles .
martin schulz , a german social democrat who is head of a parliamentarian group in strasbourg told topolanek " you have not understood what the task of the eu presidency is , " later describing the " hell " remark as " not the level on which the eu ought to be operating with the us . "
what made topolanek 's remarks even more impolitic was that the czech prime minister 's governing coalition had lost its parliamentary majority the day before , forcing his resignation , which will probably take place after prague 's eu presidency ends in june .
topolanek is still expected to host us president barack obama at a us-eu summit in prague next month following the g20 meeting in london .
eu-us meeting in prague will be business as usual us officials in washington said that obama 's meeting with the czech prime minister will go ahead as planned .
" the president considers his first meeting with the european union to be an important opportunity to discuss trans-atlantic cooperation on a broad range of issues , " national security council spokesman mike hammer was quoted as saying to afp .
" the president also is looking forward to deepening our relationship with the czech republic and people .
the fall of the czech government is the result of a democratic process . "
later on thursday , eu officials struggled to douse the diplomatic fires .
the eu and us responses to the current economic crisis are " increasingly converging , " and the eu is " working hard with our american and other international partners " ahead of a summit of the g20 economies , european commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen said .

the decision comes after moves by the us administration toward a more friendly relationship with the islamic republic . an iranian official said thursday , march 26 , that tehran will take part in a united nations conference on the future of afghanistan to be held in the hague next week .
us secretary of state hillary clinton , one of the main instigators behind the meeting , is also expected to attend . iranian foreign minister hassan qashqavi confirmed tehran would send a representative to the meeting but added that " the level of participation is not clear . " the us state department said there were no plans for a " substantive " meeting between clinton and the iranian representative at the conference . " this conference is about reaching a regional consensus about afghanistan , " state department spokesman gordon duguid said . " it is not a conference about us-iranian relations . " the talks will be hosted by afghanistan , the netherlands and the united nations and opened by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
the 80 countries and 20 international organizations attending are expected to focus on security and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan where nato and us troops face the growing threat of a taliban insurgency .
the united states is also set to present a review of its policy in afghanistan and pakistan . a two-way approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west is concerned iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said iran 's involvement showed that efforts by europe and the us to improve relations have had an effect .
iran sat out a similar meeting in france last december . she said the eu and united states have promoted a two-track policy toward tehran . " one track is sanctions to ensure a more cooperative behavior , " verhagen said .
" -lrb- the other -rrb- way is to offer a positive package if they cooperate .
i think this participation of iran in an international conference fits also within this two-way approach . " news of iran 's participation comes one week after us president barack obama offered a " new beginning " in the diplomatic relationship between iran and the us in a televised address released to broadcasters in the middle east .
in another overture to iran , clinton called earlier this month for it to be invited to attend the meeting diplomatic ties between tehran and washington have been frosty for three decades . the us , along with the eu , has accused iran of pursuing a nuclear weapons program .
iran has consistently maintained its nuclear program serves only civilian purposes . but analysts have said the two countries share an interest in a stable afghanistan . " we believe that a regional solution should be found for the afghanistan crisis , " the semi-official fars news agency quoted foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as saying .
" iran 's goal in the region is to help peace , stability and calm , which is necessary for the region ’ s progress . " hf / sms / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have successfully concluded negotiations on a multilateral support package including the imf , the eu , the world bank and other international organizations , " said jeffrey franks , head of the imf mission , at the end of negotiations wednesday .
the imf will make 12.95 billion euros available in a two-year standby credit , franks said .
the imf acknowledged the bleak economic prospects for romania , already one of the eu 's poorest countries in per capita terms , but said aid would limit the impact of the global financial crisis .
" in -lrb- the -rrb- current world economic environment ... the financing gap has opened up , " franks told reporters .
" with international support , the adjustment will be cushioned and we are hoping to avoid the worst and have a gradual adjustment over time . "
the european commission is to raise an additional 5 billion euros from the international financial markets and hand them over in installments to romania at favorable terms .
additionally , the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development , along with other institutes , will each contribute 1 billion euros to assist romania .
to access the money , franks said romania will have to ensure that its budget deficit for 2009 does not exceed 5.1 per cent of gross domestic product .
that figure reached 5.3 per cent in 2008 , and the european commission now wants it to be reduced to below 3 per cent in 2011 .
by taking the aid , romania 's government would also commit itself to freezing wages in the public sector and reforming public pensions .
franks said public sector wages doubled over the last three years .
additionally , romania 's central bank would be obliged to hold inflation below 4.5 percent .
franks added that romania 's banking system remains unstable .
nonetheless , he said imf officials would meet thursday in vienna with the 10 banks that do the most business in romania in an effort to convince them not to withdraw funding from their operations in the country .
eu welcomes deal to ease romania 's struggles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia hopes romania will emerge stronger eu officials in brussels welcomed the deal , with european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia saying the aid package would help romania emerge " stronger " from the crisis .
" i am aware of the hardships that romania and its citizens are encountering at this time of crisis , but i am confident that with the right policies and with the help of the eu and other international bodies , they will emerge stronger , " almunia said in a statement .
the european commission is also providing soft loans totaling 9.6 billion euros to latvia and hungary .
of the 6.5 billion euros being lent to hungary , 2 billion were recently raised on the money markets and handed over to budapest at an annual interest rate of 3.25 per cent , officials in brussels said .
at a summit in brussels last week , eu leaders agreed to double the commission 's balance-of-payments facilities to 50 billion euros amid concerns that other non-euro zone member states may be about to fall victim of the global credit crunch .
the imf has forecast that the romanian economy faces a contraction of 4 to 6 percent in 2009 , after posting 7.1 per cent growth in 2008 .
romanian prime minister emil boc is expected to sign the agreement in two weeks .
the first 5-billion-euro funding injection could be headed to romania by early may .
ebrd chief calls for troubled nations to ask for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mirow wants countries to speak up about hardship the head of the european bank for reconstruction and development -lrb- ebrd -rrb- , thomas mirow , meanwhile told the financial times deutschland newspaper wednesday that troubled eastern european economies should seek help now rather than feed speculation about their problems .
" countries that think they need international monetary fund help should turn quickly to the imf , " he said .
" it would be terrible for market sentiment if throughout 2009 , like in a serial novel , we have to constantly ask ourselves which is the next country on the list " of those needing bailouts , he added .
in the current crisis , romania is the fifth central and eastern european country after hungary , latvia , serbia and ukraine to turn to the imf for help .
franks said the imf mission to romania would now to go to vienna to meet the main foreign banks active in the region " to negotiate their support . "
in a statement , imf managing director dominique strauss-kahn said the deal was subject to approval by the fund 's executive board , which would meet " in the coming weeks " to discuss the stand-by arrangement . nda / afp / dpa / reuters / ftd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but singing in the facility 's choir offers a ticket to the outside world - at least when the group is on tour . romania 's sole women 's prison used to be a convent .
today , it is home to over 1,000 inmates , mainly women who have murdered their husbands .
targsor penitentiary , some 100 kilometers north of romania 's capital bucharest , still shows signs of its past .
the courtyard looks more like a monastery than a prison .
and the central building is a church . the atmosphere is quite domestic .
women in regular clothing sit on a bench doing handicraft while others work in the prison textile factory . " we can hardly call this detention , " guide geta says .
" it does n't feel like a penitentiary at all . " geta says detention conditions have improved a lot in recent years , especially since targsor got a woman commander .
now , inmates have health insurance and better food .
there are television sets in their rooms , a gym offering massages and a club in which the women can relax after a day 's work in the prison textile factory or out in the fields . " we have a library here , " geta says .
" the inmates can paint , watch films and learn english if they want to . " the highlight , though , is the stage where the prison choir practices and gives concerts for various guests . trying to move on the choir is certainly the most attractive activity here , because it is a ticket to the outside world .
camelia has a sentence for life , but she hopes she 'll be released after she has served 20 years .
for her , and many other inmates , the choir is like a breath of fresh air . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the choir performed its debut concert in bucharest camelia says she has managed to get out of the facility a few times , when the choir was invited to perform in various places around the country . " we have had the opportunity to go out and we 've seen that nobody hates us , " camelia says .
" we 're not being marginalized .
we 're just regarded as persons who have made mistakes in their life .
now we 're trying to straighten up , to regain a sense of balance and move on with our life . " a memorable performance the choir of targsor prison was set up in 2005 with the support of the german cultural center in bucharest .
it made its debut at the lutheran church in the romanian capital .
conductor mihai nae says he will always remember that concert with pleasure . " not everybody can perform there , so it 's a pretty select venue , " nae says .
" we were really flattered to perform there . " he said the event helped the inmates very much . " they were ecstatic to see the world , the cities that have changed so much in all these years , " nae says .
" we even went on a picnic one day . " the choir also performs in other prisons regularly , as part of various cultural exchanges . the penitentiary in targsor is now a far cry from what it used to be : a place which the communist authorities used to re-educate students who opposed the dictatorial regime . today , the only problem detainees have is time dragging on too slowly .

the field of candidates to head the un atomic agency is down to a japanese diplomat and a south african anti-apartheid activist .
if neither achieves the required two-thirds majority , the race opens up to others . the two front runners for the leadership of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna are japanese diplomat yukiva amano , 62 , and abdul minty , 69 , a former anti-apartheid activist from south africa .
the 35 members of the iaea board failed to elect either candidate in three rounds of voting on thursday and if neither man emerges with the two-thirds majority necessary to head the un agency by friday , the race will open up to a field of new candidates .
both men are steeped in nuclear proliferation issues and have pushed for civilian uses of atomic energy .
japan 's amano is favored mainly by the rich industrial nations and has the lead at the moment , whereas developing countries tend to prefer minty , according to unnamed diplomats cited by reuters .
nobel peace prize winner elbaradei steps down the race is important since whoever the new iaea head will be influences how the world meets the nuclear challenges posed by iran , syria or other volatile states allegedly seeking to develop the bomb .
mohamed elbaradei , the current director-general will step down in november after having served 12 years , but the board would like to have his successor in place by june to ensure a smooth transition . the head of the iaea is tasked with helping signatories to the nuclear non-proliferation treay pursue peaceful civilian uses of atomic energy , but during elbaradei 's tenure , the agency has assumed more of a watchdog role , monitoring nations that could be secretly developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vienna 's iaea has assumed a watchdog role for " rogue states " . elbaradei , 67 , a seasoned egyptian diplomat and lawyer who shared the nobel peace prize with the iaea in 2005 , has openly clashed with the bush administration over what he viewed as washington 's hostile policy towards iran and iraq .
in spite of tensions with former president george w. bush , whose justification for the 2003 iraq war was the belief that iraq was hiding weapons of mass destruction , elbaradei secured a third four-year term at the iaea with us backing .
" nine too many " nuclear powers in the world today since succeeding swedish diplomat hans blix in 1997 , mr elbaradei 's method of dealing with nuclear rows was to combine weapons inspections with engaging iraq , iran and north korea . " verification and diplomacy , used together , can work , " he has said .
" the iraq experience demonstrated that inspections can be effective even when the country being inspected is less than co-operative .
all the evidence indicates that iraq 's nuclear weapons program had been effectively dismantled in the 1990s through iaea inspection , -lrb- which -rrb- we were ready to conclude before the war . " now that us president barack obama has said he wants to open a dialogue with iran , elbaradei 's successor could benefit from washington 's commitment to new diplomatic efforts .
elbaradei has always been a strong proponent of general nuclear disarmament .
there are nine nuclear powers in the world today .

these are shifting the military balance in asia and have implications beyond the region , said the latest report by the pentagon on china 's armed forces .
it again criticised beijing for a lack of transparency in reporting military spending and security policy .
the report also welcomed the rise of a peaceful , stable and prosperous china .
" however , " it adds , " much uncertainty surrounds china 's future course , particularly regarding how its expanding military power might be used . "
projecting power ?
china is successfully managing to expand its arsenal of sophisticated weaponry , even though china 's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited , the pentagon reported .
chinese " armed forces continue to develop and field disruptive military technologies " , including " nuclear , space , and cyber warfare " .
south china sea tensions territorial claims from china , the philippines , taiwan , brunei , vietnam and malaysia overlap in resource-rich sea hosts some of the world 's busiest shipping lanes china says the us was in its exclusive economic zone - but the two sides disagree on what activities are allowed in an eez some of these developments help china to participate in international peacekeeping , humanitarian and counter-piracy missions , it acknowledged .
but they could also allow china to " project power to ensure access to resources or enforce claims to disputed territories , " the report said .
the pentagon analysis said china is developing weapons that would disable its enemies ' space technology such as satellites , boosting its electromagnetic warfare and cyber-warfare capabilities and continuing to modernise its nuclear arsenal .
it also said china had sold nearly $ 7bn -lrb- £ 4.8bn -rrb- worth of conventional arms in the global market , with pakistan as the main customer .
the pentagon noted china 's construction of large naval base on hainan island " with direct access to vital international sea lanes " . offering " the potential for stealthy deployment of submarines into the deep waters of the south china sea " .
its report comes after a confrontation between us and chinese ships in china 's exclusive economic zone south of hainan , during which china accused the us of spying .
china claims sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands - claims challenged by a number of neighbouring countries .
the report estimated 2008 china 's military spending was roughly double that of a decade ago .
beijing usually criticises the pentagon report , saying it unfairly portrays china as a military threat when it is committed to a " peaceful rise " as its economic power grows .

china is successfully managing to expand its arsenal of sophisticated weaponry , even though china 's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited , the pentagon reported .
chinese " armed forces continue to develop and field disruptive military technologies " , including " nuclear , space , and cyber warfare " .

but they could also allow china to " project power to ensure access to resources or enforce claims to disputed territories , " the report said .
the pentagon analysis said china is developing weapons that would disable its enemies ' space technology such as satellites , boosting its electromagnetic warfare and cyber-warfare capabilities and continuing to modernise its nuclear arsenal .
it also said china had sold nearly $ 7bn -lrb- £ 4.8bn -rrb- worth of conventional arms in the global market , with pakistan as the main customer .
the pentagon noted china 's construction of large naval base on hainan island " with direct access to vital international sea lanes " . offering " the potential for stealthy deployment of submarines into the deep waters of the south china sea " .
its report comes after a confrontation between us and chinese ships in china 's exclusive economic zone south of hainan , during which china accused the us of spying .
china claims sovereignty over the spratly and paracel islands - claims challenged by a number of neighbouring countries .
the report estimated 2008 china 's military spending was roughly double that of a decade ago .

it is hoped the extra funding will lead to waiting times for patients due to begin ivf treatment being reduced from 18 months to one year .
the annual boost comes after a one-off investment of £ 800,000 in recent months to reduce waiting lists .
health minister michael mcgimpsey said current funding had provided for more than 400 cycles of treatment per year .
mr mcgimpsey said : " the extra recurrent funding i am providing will ensure that , going forward , no-one who qualifies for publicly funded treatment will have a waiting time of longer than a year , and should allow a move towards increasing the number of cycles of treatment . "
" it is an illness , either male or female factor infertility , and has to be treated like an illness " sharon davidson in fertility network uk heartbreaking wait for ivf currently , women in northern ireland are only allowed one free cycle on the nhs - unlike england where in most trusts women are entitled to three .
one woman , who is currently waiting to be told when her treatment will begin , told bbc news she thought this was " very unfair " .
" i do n't think one is enough because if you 're depending on that one cycle it puts an awful lot of pressure on you for it to work .
" i think it should be at least three like they have in parts of england - we should be brought in line with them . "
the names of patients will now be contained on one regional waiting list .
this will ensure equality of access to all northern ireland residents , according to the department of health .
treatment is limited to those with a medical cause for infertility and in general couples must have been trying for a year to be diagnosed as having fertility problems .
sharon davidson , the northern ireland organiser for the in fertility network uk , welcomed the extra funding , but said , in reality , couples tend to have to wait more than 18 months for treatment .
" it is an illness , either male or female factor infertility , and has to be treated like an illness , " she said .

media requires javascript to play .
advertisement former president chen shui-bian is driven to the court in taipei taiwan 's former president chen shui-bian has gone on trial accused of a series of corruption charges in a case that has gripped the island .
mr chen , 58 , along with his wife and 12 others , is accused of embezzlement , taking bribes and money laundering .
he denies the charges and says he is a victim of a " government purge " .
since leaving office in 2008 , mr chen has been a vocal critic of the new government 's support for china , which claims sovereignty over taiwan .
prosecutors allege mr chen and his wife wu shu-chen embezzled money from a special presidential fund and laundered it through swiss banks during his eight years in office .
they also accuse the couple of receiving bribes from a taiwanese company to help it sell a piece of land to the government .
altogether , the money involved in the case adds up to an estimated $ 11m -lrb- £ 7.5m -rrb- .
in february , mrs wu pleaded guilty to accepting a $ 2.2m -lrb- £ 1.5m -rrb- political donation in connection with a land purchase deal , but denied that it had been a bribe , as alleged by prosecutors .
she admitted charges of forging documents in a separate case but denied using the money for personal gain .
nine other accused , including mr chen 's son and daughter-in-law , have pleaded guilty to some charges related to the case .
' unbearable pain ' mr chen was taken into the taipei courtroom in handcuffs to face the start of the formal proceedings against him .
the case has attracted huge public interest in taiwan " the case has nothing to do with me and this is causing me unbearable pain , " he told the court , according to the afp news agency .
his trial will initially investigate the alleged land deal before moving on to other charges , and is expected to last for several months .
the bbc 's cindy sui in taipei says people in taiwan have been engrossed in the case , with some people shocked by the alleged crimes but others believing it is an example of political revenge .
mr chen says the charges against him are politically motivated , constructed by the ruling kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- government to please beijing .

advertisement former president chen shui-bian is driven to the court in taipei taiwan 's former president chen shui-bian has gone on trial accused of a series of corruption charges in a case that has gripped the island .
mr chen , 58 , along with his wife and 12 others , is accused of embezzlement , taking bribes and money laundering .
he denies the charges and says he is a victim of a " government purge " .
since leaving office in 2008 , mr chen has been a vocal critic of the new government 's support for china , which claims sovereignty over taiwan .
prosecutors allege mr chen and his wife wu shu-chen embezzled money from a special presidential fund and laundered it through swiss banks during his eight years in office .
they also accuse the couple of receiving bribes from a taiwanese company to help it sell a piece of land to the government .
altogether , the money involved in the case adds up to an estimated $ 11m -lrb- £ 7.5m -rrb- .
in february , mrs wu pleaded guilty to accepting a $ 2.2m -lrb- £ 1.5m -rrb- political donation in connection with a land purchase deal , but denied that it had been a bribe , as alleged by prosecutors .
she admitted charges of forging documents in a separate case but denied using the money for personal gain .
nine other accused , including mr chen 's son and daughter-in-law , have pleaded guilty to some charges related to the case .
' unbearable pain ' mr chen was taken into the taipei courtroom in handcuffs to face the start of the formal proceedings against him .
the case has attracted huge public interest in taiwan " the case has nothing to do with me and this is causing me unbearable pain , " he told the court , according to the afp news agency .
his trial will initially investigate the alleged land deal before moving on to other charges , and is expected to last for several months .
the bbc 's cindy sui in taipei says people in taiwan have been engrossed in the case , with some people shocked by the alleged crimes but others believing it is an example of political revenge .
mr chen says the charges against him are politically motivated , constructed by the ruling kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- government to please beijing .

prosecutors allege mr chen and his wife wu shu-chen embezzled money from a special presidential fund and laundered it through swiss banks during his eight years in office .
they also accuse the couple of receiving bribes from a taiwanese company to help it sell a piece of land to the government .
altogether , the money involved in the case adds up to an estimated $ 11m -lrb- £ 7.5m -rrb- .
in february , mrs wu pleaded guilty to accepting a $ 2.2m -lrb- £ 1.5m -rrb- political donation in connection with a land purchase deal , but denied that it had been a bribe , as alleged by prosecutors .
she admitted charges of forging documents in a separate case but denied using the money for personal gain .
nine other accused , including mr chen 's son and daughter-in-law , have pleaded guilty to some charges related to the case .
' unbearable pain ' mr chen was taken into the taipei courtroom in handcuffs to face the start of the formal proceedings against him .
the case has attracted huge public interest in taiwan " the case has nothing to do with me and this is causing me unbearable pain , " he told the court , according to the afp news agency .
his trial will initially investigate the alleged land deal before moving on to other charges , and is expected to last for several months .
the bbc 's cindy sui in taipei says people in taiwan have been engrossed in the case , with some people shocked by the alleged crimes but others believing it is an example of political revenge .
mr chen says the charges against him are politically motivated , constructed by the ruling kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- government to please beijing .
relations between beijing and taipei have been improving since the kmt , under president ma ying-jeou , took office last year .
mr chen has also challenged the impartiality of the judging panel , saying the fact they had not allowed him out on bail in december was " punitive " .
charges against mr chen embezzling $ 3m from the presidential fund taking $ 9m in bribes over a land purchase deal laundering money in swiss bank accounts differing views on taiwan trial " in order to gain favour and protection from the beijing authorities , the nationalist government has launched an all-out purge and cleansing against the former ... administration , " mr chen 's office said on wednesday .
the kmt party accused mr chen of failing to " set an example " as a national leader .
the court date follows more than two months of pre-trial hearings .
if found guilty , mr chen could spend the rest of his life in prison .
taiwan has been ruled separately from china since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 , when the defeated kuomintang retreated to taiwan to create a self-governing entity .
but beijing sees the island as a breakaway province which should be reunified with the mainland , by force if necessary .

john evans from abergele , in conwy , was seriously ill at christmas when he heard that springer spaniel jamie did not have any toys to play with .
he sent a box of toys and other treats but in the two months the box took to find jamie mr evans sadly passed away .
his wife , barbara , is overjoyed that mr evans ' gift arrived safely .
" i was quite surprised the box found jamie at all , and john would have been chuffed , " said mrs evans .
mr evans served with the raf for eight years as a young man , and was always keen to help any forces charity , said his wife .
" he 'd heard about the dog on the radio and how he 'd like an old tennis ball to play with and a tin of soup , " she said .
mr evans was touched by jamie 's plight " so i took him down to the pet shop and he bought all sorts , and put a mug in the box as well in case the soup was for the handler . "
the family had no idea how to get the box to jamie and so tracked down a charity on the internet that sends out boxes to service personnel who are overseas at christmas .
then they sent the box addressed to " jamie the springer spaniel sniffer dog - somewhere in afghanistan " to the charity uk4u-thanks .
one of the charity 's trustees , allan sims , decided to track down jamie the dog .
mr sims said he asked anyone he could think of if they knew of the dog , but at first it came to nothing .
" the answers were never quite right , several sniffer dogs were known , most were different names and one called jamie was n't a springer spaniel , " he said .
after two months however an raf group captain sent an email saying that jamie had been found .
mrs evans said her husband would have been chuffed by then mr sims had been in touch with mr evans ' family and learnt he had died from pneumonia .
" it makes me cry this story , and barbara is such a lovely lady , " he said .
now the ministry of defence have made pictures available of jamie the dog with his toys , and his handler l / cpl jim wilkinson , 23 , of pocklington near york , which will be sent to barbara as a precious memory of her husband .
" it 's been a long tour for both me and jamie and receiving these gifts means an enormous amount , particularly as we are nearing the end of our time out here , " said l / cpl wilkinson .
" it was an extremely kind thought and i have to say we were all immensely touched when we heard the sad news .
" i want to take the opportunity to let mrs evans know how grateful we are , and i hope it eases the sadness of her loss knowing how much we appreciated the gifts . "
