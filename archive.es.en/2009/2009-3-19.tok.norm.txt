the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse . " i 'm sorry from the bottom of my heart , " the retired engineer told the eight jurors before they retired to quickly reach guilty verdict .
" unfortunately , i ca n't change anything now . " fritzl an " exploiter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prosecutor christiane burkheiser said fritzl was not to be believed but chief prosecutor christiane burkheiser said the remorse shown by fritzl was not genuine . " do n't believe him , he 's shown his true face in trying to exploit people 's gullibility , " she said of fritzl and his stunning change of heart on wednesday when he pleaded guilty to enslaving his daughter elisabeth as well as murder . fritzl had forced his daughter elisabeth , now 42 , to live in a hidden underground cellar where he routinely raped her , leading to the birth of seven children . he was found to have caused the death of the newborn by failing to seek medical help despite knowing the child was in danger of dying . he had earlier pleaded innocent to the charges of murder and enslavement , but reversed his plea on wednesday after being faced with 11 hours of video testimony given by elisabeth . sentence " obvious " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators camped outside the court to protest against fritzl fritzl 's lawyer , rudolf mayer , said that his client found the verdict " fair . " " after confessing to 3,000 instances of rapes , 24 years of captivity in a cellar plus murder , it 's obvious that such a sentence will be handed down , " mayer told journalists . psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court wednesday that fritzl was emotionally stunted and still posed a danger despite his age . " he is aware - he says so himself - that he has an evil side .
he is aware that he was born to rape .
he has that partly under control .
but as soon as he loosens his grip , everything erupts out . " the basic need was for power .
it is about domination , about power , about control . " dfm / sms / reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .

bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .

about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .
tax havens remain contentious while the bloc 's czech presidency expects an agreement on such common language to be reached over dinner on thursday , one potential source of friction may come from calls , mainly from paris and berlin , to fight tax havens and other potential threats to " market integrity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany want to make sure cash is n't being hidden from tax officials the leaders of austria , belgium and luxembourg fear being singled out by other government leaders because of their countries ' bank secrecy rules and may well drive a hard bargain . luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker criticized pressure on luxembourg and switzerland 's banking secrecy in an interview with the swiss newspaper le temps , saying the french and german stance was tainted by arrogance and " mediocre " populism . the meeting also comes amid fresh concerns over the poor state of the bloc 's economy , which according to latest estimates , may shrink by as much as 3 percent this year and not recover before 2011 . the eu 's economic recovery package totals about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 519 billion -rrb- , or 3.3 percent of the bloc 's annual gross domestic product , spread over two years .
about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but officials in brussels say it is too early to judge whether more money will be needed .
merkel , sarkozy : stable public finances crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are promoting regulation rather than spending to fight the recession moreover , they note that many member states are not in the position to spend more without running even bigger budget deficits , which in turn threaten the stability of the euro .
this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .

in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .

bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .

but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .

bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .

" germany has made it clear that additional measures can only be accepted , and we will only agree to them , if they start in 2009 or 2010 , because it makes no sense to spend money in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 when the crisis has long been overcome , " she said . help for eastern , central europe merkel also said the eu had been in discussion with the international monetary fund and european development bank about restructuring the banking landscape in central and eastern europe , a region particularly hard hit by the crisis .

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .

whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .

" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .
tax havens remain contentious while the bloc 's czech presidency expects an agreement on such common language to be reached over dinner on thursday , one potential source of friction may come from calls , mainly from paris and berlin , to fight tax havens and other potential threats to " market integrity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany want to make sure cash is n't being hidden from tax officials the leaders of austria , belgium and luxembourg fear being singled out by other government leaders because of their countries ' bank secrecy rules and may well drive a hard bargain . luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker criticized pressure on luxembourg and switzerland 's banking secrecy in an interview with the swiss newspaper le temps , saying the french and german stance was tainted by arrogance and " mediocre " populism . the meeting also comes amid fresh concerns over the poor state of the bloc 's economy , which according to latest estimates , may shrink by as much as 3 percent this year and not recover before 2011 . the eu 's economic recovery package totals about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 519 billion -rrb- , or 3.3 percent of the bloc 's annual gross domestic product , spread over two years .
about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but officials in brussels say it is too early to judge whether more money will be needed .
merkel , sarkozy : stable public finances crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are promoting regulation rather than spending to fight the recession moreover , they note that many member states are not in the position to spend more without running even bigger budget deficits , which in turn threaten the stability of the euro .
this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .

whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .

however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .

bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .
" now all i can do is knock on wood and hope no one -lsb- else -rsb- gets hurt . "
bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll stay in the friedland camp , which has housed 4 million refugees since world war ii . the refugee camp at friedland was established on the border between the british and soviet zones .
british troops took over a research farm formerly owned by goettingen university , and the area was officially named a " border crossing camp " on sept .
20 , 1945 .
it has been under the control of the state of lower saxony since 1948 .
historically , it was the place where people from the soviet-controlled east entered the west .
among them were refugees , displaced people and ethnic germans from the formerly german-controlled areas in the east , as well as soviet prisoners of war trying to return home .
the last 10,000 of them reached the border station in 1955 - ten years after the war had ended .
in the soviet union they were seen as war criminals and showed up once diplomatic relations between the ussr and west germany were opened .
pieces of a puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was founded on the border between the british and soviet zones after the creation of the two german states in 1949 , the friedland camp remained an initial destination for migrants from east germany and so-called late german repatriates - germans from russia and eastern europe who returned to germany years or decades after the war ended .
in friedland , there was a multitude of data about millions of repatriates , emigrants and others returning home as well as over 200,000 german prisoners of war .
german governmental departments put this material to good use , but it was also looked upon with great interest by secret services from all over the west , who interrogated all of the new arrivals .
each person coming from the east carried with bits of information , which were important to the military in developing of larger picture of their cold war enemy .
after the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,500 iraqis , many of them christians , will start a new life in germany more than four million people have passed through the camp , which many considered their gateway to freedom .
starting in 1990 , emigrants from former soviet satellite countries have made up the majority of arrivals .
since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .
in 1956 , 3,000 hungarians , who had fled their homeland after a failed uprising , arrived at the camp .
chileans suffering from political persecution after the pinochet took control of chile in a coup on sept .
11 , 1973 also made their way there .
later the camp became the first stop in germany for so-called boat people from vietnam , tamils from sri lanka , refugees from albania and , as of 2009 , refugees from iraq .

the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 19.03.2009 bayern forced to rely on odd man out podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has gone from the stands to the starting eleven for most of the season , striker lukas podolski has struggled even to make coach juergen klinsmann 's squads .
but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .
" now all i can do is knock on wood and hope no one -lsb- else -rsb- gets hurt . "
bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 19.03.2009 verdict due in austrian incest , murder case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl entered courthouse without covering his face the jury in the case of the 73-year-old austrian man who enslaved and raped his daughter for 24 years is now considering its verdict .
on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 19.03.2009 bayern forced to rely on odd man out podolski großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski has gone from the stands to the starting eleven for most of the season , striker lukas podolski has struggled even to make coach juergen klinsmann 's squads .
but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .
" now all i can do is knock on wood and hope no one -lsb- else -rsb- gets hurt . "
bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse .

" " after confessing to 3,000 instances of rapes , 24 years of captivity in a cellar plus murder , it 's obvious that such a sentence will be handed down , " mayer told journalists . psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court wednesday that fritzl was emotionally stunted and still posed a danger despite his age . " he is aware - he says so himself - that he has an evil side .
he is aware that he was born to rape .
he has that partly under control .
but as soon as he loosens his grip , everything erupts out . " the basic need was for power .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .
tax havens remain contentious while the bloc 's czech presidency expects an agreement on such common language to be reached over dinner on thursday , one potential source of friction may come from calls , mainly from paris and berlin , to fight tax havens and other potential threats to " market integrity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany want to make sure cash is n't being hidden from tax officials the leaders of austria , belgium and luxembourg fear being singled out by other government leaders because of their countries ' bank secrecy rules and may well drive a hard bargain . luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker criticized pressure on luxembourg and switzerland 's banking secrecy in an interview with the swiss newspaper le temps , saying the french and german stance was tainted by arrogance and " mediocre " populism . the meeting also comes amid fresh concerns over the poor state of the bloc 's economy , which according to latest estimates , may shrink by as much as 3 percent this year and not recover before 2011 . the eu 's economic recovery package totals about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 519 billion -rrb- , or 3.3 percent of the bloc 's annual gross domestic product , spread over two years .
about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but officials in brussels say it is too early to judge whether more money will be needed .
merkel , sarkozy : stable public finances crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are promoting regulation rather than spending to fight the recession moreover , they note that many member states are not in the position to spend more without running even bigger budget deficits , which in turn threaten the stability of the euro .
this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse .

" " after confessing to 3,000 instances of rapes , 24 years of captivity in a cellar plus murder , it 's obvious that such a sentence will be handed down , " mayer told journalists . psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court wednesday that fritzl was emotionally stunted and still posed a danger despite his age . " he is aware - he says so himself - that he has an evil side .
he is aware that he was born to rape .
he has that partly under control .

to round off a rough week , he also engaged in a battle of historical metaphors with the swiss . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that it might be necessary for the german government to once again cut the 2009 economic forecast .
in an interview with the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , steinbrueck said it was possible they would not be able to keep economic contraction at 2.25 percent , but added that he could n't say how low it might go .
some economists are predicting the economy could contract by up to 5 percent this year .
" we have no idea yet of the effect our economic stimulus plans will have , " he added .
berlin has approved two stimulus plans so far , together worth 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 109 billion -rrb- .
since october of last year , the german government has already twice cut its forecast for europe 's largest economy .
then , berlin had predicted 1.2 percent growth , despite the global credit crunch that had already started to make its way around the world .
called out by the swiss bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss have been fighting to stay off a tax haven blacklist steinbrueck 's troubles are n't limited to a contracting economy .
in the ongoing debate about how to deal with banking secrecy laws , the german finance minister compared countries with these rules to the native americans in the wild west .
" the cavalry at fort yuma does n't always need to ride out , sometimes it 's enough for the indians to know that they 're there , " he said .
while steinbrueck claims he was n't specifically referring to the swiss , many in bern have taken the statement personally .
during a debate in switzerland 's parliament , thomas mueller , a member of christian democratic people 's party of switzerland , said that peer steinbrueck has redefined the image of an " ugly german . "
" he reminds me of that generation of germans who , 60 years ago , walked through the streets wearing leather jackets , boots and arm bands , " he added .
tax havens , as well as financial regulation , will be discussed at an eu summit in brussels on thursday and friday . mrm / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .
tax havens remain contentious while the bloc 's czech presidency expects an agreement on such common language to be reached over dinner on thursday , one potential source of friction may come from calls , mainly from paris and berlin , to fight tax havens and other potential threats to " market integrity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany want to make sure cash is n't being hidden from tax officials the leaders of austria , belgium and luxembourg fear being singled out by other government leaders because of their countries ' bank secrecy rules and may well drive a hard bargain . luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker criticized pressure on luxembourg and switzerland 's banking secrecy in an interview with the swiss newspaper le temps , saying the french and german stance was tainted by arrogance and " mediocre " populism . the meeting also comes amid fresh concerns over the poor state of the bloc 's economy , which according to latest estimates , may shrink by as much as 3 percent this year and not recover before 2011 . the eu 's economic recovery package totals about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 519 billion -rrb- , or 3.3 percent of the bloc 's annual gross domestic product , spread over two years .
about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but officials in brussels say it is too early to judge whether more money will be needed .
merkel , sarkozy : stable public finances crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are promoting regulation rather than spending to fight the recession moreover , they note that many member states are not in the position to spend more without running even bigger budget deficits , which in turn threaten the stability of the euro .
this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

" i would find it extremely dangerous if countries on different sides of the atlantic were to take different directions , " she said .
" a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation . " one of the goals of the two-day eu meeting is to forge a common european position on financial market regulation that can be presented to the g20 summit of industrialized and emerging economies in london on april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were in good spirits ahead of the two-day summit " a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation , " merkel told german parliamentarians . eu leaders are likely to rebuff calls for more us-style stimulus spending at the thursday meeting after the federal reserve announced wednesday it would allocate more than a trillion dollars to help spark a us recovery . " existing measures must work " in berlin , merkel continued cautioning against governments introducing new emergency economic packages before the ones already in place had begun to kick in . " it is not time to look at more growth measures , " she said .
" i disagree with this idea completely .
the existing measures must work , they must be allowed to develop . " merkel said germany had already done its part for the economy by pumping more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 107 billion -rrb- via two stimulus packages into the eu 's 400-billion-euro economic recovery program , making it one of the biggest contributors to the scheme . wait and see approach european commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday also urged eu governments to implement the bloc 's stimulus plan , warning that calls to do more would undermine confidence in a swift recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says further stimulus packages could be dangerous for confidence " let 's implement the plan and review it if necessary , " barroso said .
" saying the plan is not enough will not build confidence .

" i would find it extremely dangerous if countries on different sides of the atlantic were to take different directions , " she said .
" a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation . " one of the goals of the two-day eu meeting is to forge a common european position on financial market regulation that can be presented to the g20 summit of industrialized and emerging economies in london on april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were in good spirits ahead of the two-day summit " a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation , " merkel told german parliamentarians . eu leaders are likely to rebuff calls for more us-style stimulus spending at the thursday meeting after the federal reserve announced wednesday it would allocate more than a trillion dollars to help spark a us recovery . " existing measures must work " in berlin , merkel continued cautioning against governments introducing new emergency economic packages before the ones already in place had begun to kick in . " it is not time to look at more growth measures , " she said .
" i disagree with this idea completely .
the existing measures must work , they must be allowed to develop . " merkel said germany had already done its part for the economy by pumping more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 107 billion -rrb- via two stimulus packages into the eu 's 400-billion-euro economic recovery program , making it one of the biggest contributors to the scheme . wait and see approach european commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday also urged eu governments to implement the bloc 's stimulus plan , warning that calls to do more would undermine confidence in a swift recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says further stimulus packages could be dangerous for confidence " let 's implement the plan and review it if necessary , " barroso said .
" saying the plan is not enough will not build confidence . " but the european package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman . but officials in brussels note that europe 's generous system of social safety nets puts it in a much better position than others to weather the storm . merkel also vowed thursday to oppose any additional europe-wide investment projects at the eu summit which did not focus on the immediate needs of the economy . " germany has made it clear that additional measures can only be accepted , and we will only agree to them , if they start in 2009 or 2010 , because it makes no sense to spend money in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 when the crisis has long been overcome , " she said . help for eastern , central europe merkel also said the eu had been in discussion with the international monetary fund and european development bank about restructuring the banking landscape in central and eastern europe , a region particularly hard hit by the crisis . " the countries of central and eastern europe are a very important export market for us , " merkel said .
" if credits and the cash flow there dry up it is not only a blow to these countries but shows that it is in our own interests to take action . " the european commission , she said , could do more by temporarily easing restrictions on subsidies , speeding up decision-making and showing greater flexibility over the stability and growth pact that monitors members ' conduct on fiscal policy . dfm / sms / reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll stay in the friedland camp , which has housed 4 million refugees since world war ii . the refugee camp at friedland was established on the border between the british and soviet zones .
british troops took over a research farm formerly owned by goettingen university , and the area was officially named a " border crossing camp " on sept .
20 , 1945 .
it has been under the control of the state of lower saxony since 1948 .
historically , it was the place where people from the soviet-controlled east entered the west .
among them were refugees , displaced people and ethnic germans from the formerly german-controlled areas in the east , as well as soviet prisoners of war trying to return home .
the last 10,000 of them reached the border station in 1955 - ten years after the war had ended .
in the soviet union they were seen as war criminals and showed up once diplomatic relations between the ussr and west germany were opened .

in friedland , there was a multitude of data about millions of repatriates , emigrants and others returning home as well as over 200,000 german prisoners of war .
german governmental departments put this material to good use , but it was also looked upon with great interest by secret services from all over the west , who interrogated all of the new arrivals .

since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .

they 'll stay in the friedland camp , which has housed 4 million refugees since world war ii . the refugee camp at friedland was established on the border between the british and soviet zones .
british troops took over a research farm formerly owned by goettingen university , and the area was officially named a " border crossing camp " on sept .
20 , 1945 .
it has been under the control of the state of lower saxony since 1948 .
historically , it was the place where people from the soviet-controlled east entered the west .
among them were refugees , displaced people and ethnic germans from the formerly german-controlled areas in the east , as well as soviet prisoners of war trying to return home .
the last 10,000 of them reached the border station in 1955 - ten years after the war had ended .
in the soviet union they were seen as war criminals and showed up once diplomatic relations between the ussr and west germany were opened .
pieces of a puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was founded on the border between the british and soviet zones after the creation of the two german states in 1949 , the friedland camp remained an initial destination for migrants from east germany and so-called late german repatriates - germans from russia and eastern europe who returned to germany years or decades after the war ended .
in friedland , there was a multitude of data about millions of repatriates , emigrants and others returning home as well as over 200,000 german prisoners of war .
german governmental departments put this material to good use , but it was also looked upon with great interest by secret services from all over the west , who interrogated all of the new arrivals .
each person coming from the east carried with bits of information , which were important to the military in developing of larger picture of their cold war enemy .
after the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,500 iraqis , many of them christians , will start a new life in germany more than four million people have passed through the camp , which many considered their gateway to freedom .
starting in 1990 , emigrants from former soviet satellite countries have made up the majority of arrivals .
since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .
in 1956 , 3,000 hungarians , who had fled their homeland after a failed uprising , arrived at the camp .
chileans suffering from political persecution after the pinochet took control of chile in a coup on sept .
11 , 1973 also made their way there .
later the camp became the first stop in germany for so-called boat people from vietnam , tamils from sri lanka , refugees from albania and , as of 2009 , refugees from iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.03.2009 imf predicts global economic contraction for 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economy can hope for improvement in 2010 , the imf said the global economy could shrink as much as 1 percent this year , the international monetary fund said , adding its voice to a chorus of economists predicting the first worldwide contraction since world war ii . as most wealthy nations suffer under deep recessions and a financial crisis driving down growth across the globe , the imf slashed its forecast for 2009 to a contraction of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent .
that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .
us and european efforts to stabilize the financial sector at the heart of the crisis " still lack coherence and credibility , " while deflation was becoming an increasing risk in richer nations , the report said . cautious outlook for 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without comprehensive policies , the recession could last longer than expected the imf predicted a small recovery in 2010 to growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent - a level that is still considered a global recession by imf standards .

" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .
most european countries had fallen well below the public spending level - 2 percent of economic output - that has been advocated by the imf . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would find it extremely dangerous if countries on different sides of the atlantic were to take different directions , " she said .
" a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation . " one of the goals of the two-day eu meeting is to forge a common european position on financial market regulation that can be presented to the g20 summit of industrialized and emerging economies in london on april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were in good spirits ahead of the two-day summit " a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation , " merkel told german parliamentarians . eu leaders are likely to rebuff calls for more us-style stimulus spending at the thursday meeting after the federal reserve announced wednesday it would allocate more than a trillion dollars to help spark a us recovery . " existing measures must work " in berlin , merkel continued cautioning against governments introducing new emergency economic packages before the ones already in place had begun to kick in . " it is not time to look at more growth measures , " she said .
" i disagree with this idea completely .
the existing measures must work , they must be allowed to develop . " merkel said germany had already done its part for the economy by pumping more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 107 billion -rrb- via two stimulus packages into the eu 's 400-billion-euro economic recovery program , making it one of the biggest contributors to the scheme . wait and see approach european commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday also urged eu governments to implement the bloc 's stimulus plan , warning that calls to do more would undermine confidence in a swift recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says further stimulus packages could be dangerous for confidence " let 's implement the plan and review it if necessary , " barroso said .
" saying the plan is not enough will not build confidence . " but the european package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman . but officials in brussels note that europe 's generous system of social safety nets puts it in a much better position than others to weather the storm . merkel also vowed thursday to oppose any additional europe-wide investment projects at the eu summit which did not focus on the immediate needs of the economy . " germany has made it clear that additional measures can only be accepted , and we will only agree to them , if they start in 2009 or 2010 , because it makes no sense to spend money in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 when the crisis has long been overcome , " she said . help for eastern , central europe merkel also said the eu had been in discussion with the international monetary fund and european development bank about restructuring the banking landscape in central and eastern europe , a region particularly hard hit by the crisis . " the countries of central and eastern europe are a very important export market for us , " merkel said .
" if credits and the cash flow there dry up it is not only a blow to these countries but shows that it is in our own interests to take action . " the european commission , she said , could do more by temporarily easing restrictions on subsidies , speeding up decision-making and showing greater flexibility over the stability and growth pact that monitors members ' conduct on fiscal policy . dfm / sms / reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i would find it extremely dangerous if countries on different sides of the atlantic were to take different directions , " she said .
" a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation . " one of the goals of the two-day eu meeting is to forge a common european position on financial market regulation that can be presented to the g20 summit of industrialized and emerging economies in london on april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were in good spirits ahead of the two-day summit " a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation , " merkel told german parliamentarians . eu leaders are likely to rebuff calls for more us-style stimulus spending at the thursday meeting after the federal reserve announced wednesday it would allocate more than a trillion dollars to help spark a us recovery . " existing measures must work " in berlin , merkel continued cautioning against governments introducing new emergency economic packages before the ones already in place had begun to kick in . " it is not time to look at more growth measures , " she said .
" i disagree with this idea completely .
the existing measures must work , they must be allowed to develop . " merkel said germany had already done its part for the economy by pumping more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 107 billion -rrb- via two stimulus packages into the eu 's 400-billion-euro economic recovery program , making it one of the biggest contributors to the scheme . wait and see approach european commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday also urged eu governments to implement the bloc 's stimulus plan , warning that calls to do more would undermine confidence in a swift recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says further stimulus packages could be dangerous for confidence " let 's implement the plan and review it if necessary , " barroso said .
" saying the plan is not enough will not build confidence . " but the european package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman . but officials in brussels note that europe 's generous system of social safety nets puts it in a much better position than others to weather the storm . merkel also vowed thursday to oppose any additional europe-wide investment projects at the eu summit which did not focus on the immediate needs of the economy . " germany has made it clear that additional measures can only be accepted , and we will only agree to them , if they start in 2009 or 2010 , because it makes no sense to spend money in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 when the crisis has long been overcome , " she said . help for eastern , central europe merkel also said the eu had been in discussion with the international monetary fund and european development bank about restructuring the banking landscape in central and eastern europe , a region particularly hard hit by the crisis . " the countries of central and eastern europe are a very important export market for us , " merkel said .
" if credits and the cash flow there dry up it is not only a blow to these countries but shows that it is in our own interests to take action . " the european commission , she said , could do more by temporarily easing restrictions on subsidies , speeding up decision-making and showing greater flexibility over the stability and growth pact that monitors members ' conduct on fiscal policy . dfm / sms / reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .
us and european efforts to stabilize the financial sector at the heart of the crisis " still lack coherence and credibility , " while deflation was becoming an increasing risk in richer nations , the report said . cautious outlook for 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without comprehensive policies , the recession could last longer than expected the imf predicted a small recovery in 2010 to growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent - a level that is still considered a global recession by imf standards .
whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .
most european countries had fallen well below the public spending level - 2 percent of economic output - that has been advocated by the imf . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .

" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.03.2009 imf predicts global economic contraction for 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economy can hope for improvement in 2010 , the imf said the global economy could shrink as much as 1 percent this year , the international monetary fund said , adding its voice to a chorus of economists predicting the first worldwide contraction since world war ii . as most wealthy nations suffer under deep recessions and a financial crisis driving down growth across the globe , the imf slashed its forecast for 2009 to a contraction of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent .
that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .
us and european efforts to stabilize the financial sector at the heart of the crisis " still lack coherence and credibility , " while deflation was becoming an increasing risk in richer nations , the report said . cautious outlook for 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without comprehensive policies , the recession could last longer than expected the imf predicted a small recovery in 2010 to growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent - a level that is still considered a global recession by imf standards .
whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .
most european countries had fallen well below the public spending level - 2 percent of economic output - that has been advocated by the imf . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .
" now all i can do is knock on wood and hope no one -lsb- else -rsb- gets hurt . "
bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 19.03.2009 verdict due in austrian incest , murder case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl entered courthouse without covering his face the jury in the case of the 73-year-old austrian man who enslaved and raped his daughter for 24 years is now considering its verdict .
on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court .

the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

they 'll stay in the friedland camp , which has housed 4 million refugees since world war ii . the refugee camp at friedland was established on the border between the british and soviet zones .
british troops took over a research farm formerly owned by goettingen university , and the area was officially named a " border crossing camp " on sept .
20 , 1945 .
it has been under the control of the state of lower saxony since 1948 .
historically , it was the place where people from the soviet-controlled east entered the west .
among them were refugees , displaced people and ethnic germans from the formerly german-controlled areas in the east , as well as soviet prisoners of war trying to return home .
the last 10,000 of them reached the border station in 1955 - ten years after the war had ended .
in the soviet union they were seen as war criminals and showed up once diplomatic relations between the ussr and west germany were opened .
pieces of a puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was founded on the border between the british and soviet zones after the creation of the two german states in 1949 , the friedland camp remained an initial destination for migrants from east germany and so-called late german repatriates - germans from russia and eastern europe who returned to germany years or decades after the war ended .
in friedland , there was a multitude of data about millions of repatriates , emigrants and others returning home as well as over 200,000 german prisoners of war .
german governmental departments put this material to good use , but it was also looked upon with great interest by secret services from all over the west , who interrogated all of the new arrivals .
each person coming from the east carried with bits of information , which were important to the military in developing of larger picture of their cold war enemy .
after the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,500 iraqis , many of them christians , will start a new life in germany more than four million people have passed through the camp , which many considered their gateway to freedom .
starting in 1990 , emigrants from former soviet satellite countries have made up the majority of arrivals .
since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .
in 1956 , 3,000 hungarians , who had fled their homeland after a failed uprising , arrived at the camp .
chileans suffering from political persecution after the pinochet took control of chile in a coup on sept .
11 , 1973 also made their way there .
later the camp became the first stop in germany for so-called boat people from vietnam , tamils from sri lanka , refugees from albania and , as of 2009 , refugees from iraq .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .
tax havens remain contentious while the bloc 's czech presidency expects an agreement on such common language to be reached over dinner on thursday , one potential source of friction may come from calls , mainly from paris and berlin , to fight tax havens and other potential threats to " market integrity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany want to make sure cash is n't being hidden from tax officials the leaders of austria , belgium and luxembourg fear being singled out by other government leaders because of their countries ' bank secrecy rules and may well drive a hard bargain . luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker criticized pressure on luxembourg and switzerland 's banking secrecy in an interview with the swiss newspaper le temps , saying the french and german stance was tainted by arrogance and " mediocre " populism . the meeting also comes amid fresh concerns over the poor state of the bloc 's economy , which according to latest estimates , may shrink by as much as 3 percent this year and not recover before 2011 . the eu 's economic recovery package totals about 400 billion euros -lrb- $ 519 billion -rrb- , or 3.3 percent of the bloc 's annual gross domestic product , spread over two years .
about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .
but officials in brussels say it is too early to judge whether more money will be needed .
merkel , sarkozy : stable public finances crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are promoting regulation rather than spending to fight the recession moreover , they note that many member states are not in the position to spend more without running even bigger budget deficits , which in turn threaten the stability of the euro .
this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to round off a rough week , he also engaged in a battle of historical metaphors with the swiss . german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned that it might be necessary for the german government to once again cut the 2009 economic forecast .
in an interview with the daily sueddeutsche zeitung , steinbrueck said it was possible they would not be able to keep economic contraction at 2.25 percent , but added that he could n't say how low it might go .

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

starting in 1990 , emigrants from former soviet satellite countries have made up the majority of arrivals .
since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .
in 1956 , 3,000 hungarians , who had fled their homeland after a failed uprising , arrived at the camp .
chileans suffering from political persecution after the pinochet took control of chile in a coup on sept .

later the camp became the first stop in germany for so-called boat people from vietnam , tamils from sri lanka , refugees from albania and , as of 2009 , refugees from iraq .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .

the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse .

he is aware that he was born to rape .
he has that partly under control .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .

but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .
" now all i can do is knock on wood and hope no one -lsb- else -rsb- gets hurt . "
bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 19.03.2009 verdict due in austrian incest , murder case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl entered courthouse without covering his face the jury in the case of the 73-year-old austrian man who enslaved and raped his daughter for 24 years is now considering its verdict .
on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .
she told of being repeatedly raped by her father since her captivity began at the age of 18 . three of her surviving six children grew up in the electronically locked bunker , having never having seen daylight .
the other three children were taken upstairs to live with their grandparents in the small town of amstetten . fritzl had explained to his wife and neighbors that the three who came to live above ground were abandoned on the doorstep as babies by elisabeth who , he said , had joined a secret sect . victim appeared in court on tuesday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the celler where fritzl held his daughter was cut off from the outside world the vienna daily newspaper kurier reported that elisabeth had made an unexpected appearance in the courtroom while parts of her videotaped testimony were being shown on tuesday . only elisabeth and one of her brothers provided witness testimony .
her other five siblings , her six surviving children and her mother , josef fritzl 's wife rosemarie , have exercised their right not to testify in court . the clinic where elisabeth and three of her children sought refuge when the scandal broke last april told the kurier that elisabeth went to court to gather impressions for a book she is planning to write about her ordeal . elisabeth and the children live in an undisclosed location and have been given new identities by the austrian authorities to protect their privacy . psychiatrist : fritzl accountable for deeds after fritzl dramatically altered his plea , a psychiatrist told the court that the defendant should be placed in an institution for mentally ill offenders . " the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed . " fritzl suffers none of the mental illnesses that would rule out his accountability , " she said . lawyer surprised by plea change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family expressed its gratitude for public support fritzl 's lawyer rudolf mayer told reporters he was completely taken by surprise when his client overturned his " not guilty " to murder and enslavement pleas . murder carries a life sentence in austria and enslavement carries 20 years .
mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.03.2009 imf predicts global economic contraction for 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the global economy can hope for improvement in 2010 , the imf said the global economy could shrink as much as 1 percent this year , the international monetary fund said , adding its voice to a chorus of economists predicting the first worldwide contraction since world war ii . as most wealthy nations suffer under deep recessions and a financial crisis driving down growth across the globe , the imf slashed its forecast for 2009 to a contraction of between 0.5 percent and 1 percent .
that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .
us and european efforts to stabilize the financial sector at the heart of the crisis " still lack coherence and credibility , " while deflation was becoming an increasing risk in richer nations , the report said . cautious outlook for 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without comprehensive policies , the recession could last longer than expected the imf predicted a small recovery in 2010 to growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent - a level that is still considered a global recession by imf standards .
whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .
most european countries had fallen well below the public spending level - 2 percent of economic output - that has been advocated by the imf . sms / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .
us and european efforts to stabilize the financial sector at the heart of the crisis " still lack coherence and credibility , " while deflation was becoming an increasing risk in richer nations , the report said . cautious outlook for 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without comprehensive policies , the recession could last longer than expected the imf predicted a small recovery in 2010 to growth of 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent - a level that is still considered a global recession by imf standards .

" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .

tax havens , a touchy issue for some eu countries , are also on the agenda . the two-day spring meeting of the european council in brussels , which begins thursday , march 19 , is seen as a key stepping stone towards london 's group of 20 summit on april 2 .
that summit will be called on to overhaul the global financial sector and avoid future credit crunches . eu heads of state and government officials are expected to issue " agreed language " on what they will want to see discussed in london . according to drafts of the brussels summit 's conclusions , leaders will aim to " give priority to restoring the functioning of credit markets and facilitating the flow of lending to the economy , " the dpa news agency reported .
they will also call on any form of protectionism to be avoided , and for world trade talks to reach an " ambitious and balanced " outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb and imf predict the economy will pick up in 2010 restoring confidence in the international markets should be achieved by granting more resources and monitoring powers to the international monetary fund , improving the transparency of hedge funds , other high-risk investments and credit rating agencies , and strengthening international supervision of major banks and insurance companies that operate in several countries , leaders have said . in addition , banks should in future build up enough capital to better face the bad times , while their managers should be dissuaded from taking excessive risks by weakening the link between company bonuses and short-term profitability .
" we expect the common language which comes out of the european council to be consistent with the preparatory discussions for the london summit , " a british diplomat told dpa .

about half of this amount is made up of so-called " automatic stabilizers " - non-discretionary public spending , such as for unemployment benefits , that naturally increases during a downturn . the package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by american economist and nobel laureate paul krugman .

this point was made clear by french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel in a joint letter addressed to the czech eu presidency and the eu commission ahead of the summit . " excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the two leaders wrote .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " at the same time , leaders will be called to discuss the need to increase the amount of capital that the european commission is able to raise on the financial markets to help eu countries that run into financial difficulties as a result of the credit crunch .
the commission , which can currently rely on 25 billion euros , has already bailed out latvia and hungary , and is now in talks with romania .
other issues due to be discussed by leaders include preparations for an april 5 eu-us summit in prague with obama , the fight against climate change , and ways to strengthen the bloc 's ties to its eastern european neighbors , including belarus , georgia and azerbaijan . sms / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now , after a raft of injuries , bayern munich have no choice but to field the former prodigy . bayern got the result they were looking for last weekend with a 3-nil away win against bochum .
but it may turn out to be a pyrrhic victory , as striker miroslav klose picked up an ankle injury that will keep him out for at least six weeks .
with luca toni out since mid-february with a gammy achilles tendon , and landon donovan having been sent back to the us , the reigning champs probably have no choice but to field prince poldi in saturday 's clash against karlsruhe .
" it 's not easy for me as a coach , " klinsmann told the sports news agency sid .

bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .
it will be the start of the biggest challenge of prince poldi 's young career - trying to help lead short-handed bayern to another title .

" i would find it extremely dangerous if countries on different sides of the atlantic were to take different directions , " she said .
" a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation . " one of the goals of the two-day eu meeting is to forge a common european position on financial market regulation that can be presented to the g20 summit of industrialized and emerging economies in london on april 2 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders were in good spirits ahead of the two-day summit " a competition to outdo each other with promises will not calm the situation , " merkel told german parliamentarians . eu leaders are likely to rebuff calls for more us-style stimulus spending at the thursday meeting after the federal reserve announced wednesday it would allocate more than a trillion dollars to help spark a us recovery . " existing measures must work " in berlin , merkel continued cautioning against governments introducing new emergency economic packages before the ones already in place had begun to kick in . " it is not time to look at more growth measures , " she said .
" i disagree with this idea completely .
the existing measures must work , they must be allowed to develop . " merkel said germany had already done its part for the economy by pumping more than 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 107 billion -rrb- via two stimulus packages into the eu 's 400-billion-euro economic recovery program , making it one of the biggest contributors to the scheme . wait and see approach european commission president jose manuel barroso on thursday also urged eu governments to implement the bloc 's stimulus plan , warning that calls to do more would undermine confidence in a swift recovery . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso says further stimulus packages could be dangerous for confidence " let 's implement the plan and review it if necessary , " barroso said .
" saying the plan is not enough will not build confidence . " but the european package has been described as insufficient by the administration of us president barack obama , and most recently by us economist and nobel laureate paul krugman . but officials in brussels note that europe 's generous system of social safety nets puts it in a much better position than others to weather the storm . merkel also vowed thursday to oppose any additional europe-wide investment projects at the eu summit which did not focus on the immediate needs of the economy . " germany has made it clear that additional measures can only be accepted , and we will only agree to them , if they start in 2009 or 2010 , because it makes no sense to spend money in 2013 , 2014 or 2015 when the crisis has long been overcome , " she said . help for eastern , central europe merkel also said the eu had been in discussion with the international monetary fund and european development bank about restructuring the banking landscape in central and eastern europe , a region particularly hard hit by the crisis . " the countries of central and eastern europe are a very important export market for us , " merkel said .
" if credits and the cash flow there dry up it is not only a blow to these countries but shows that it is in our own interests to take action . " the european commission , she said , could do more by temporarily easing restrictions on subsidies , speeding up decision-making and showing greater flexibility over the stability and growth pact that monitors members ' conduct on fiscal policy . dfm / sms / reuters / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .
the report warned that many governments had not spent enough public funds to stimulate demand and were responding increasingly with protectionist measures that will further drive down global trade .

whether even that forecast will hold up was placed squarely at the feet of government efforts to end the financial turmoil .
" in the event of further delays in implementing comprehensive policies to stabilize financial conditions , the recession will be deeper and more prolonged , " according to the report , which was presented to g20 finance ministers meeting on the outskirts of london last week . leaders of the g20 , a bloc that includes wealthy and emerging economies , will hold an emergency summit in london on april 2 to coordinate their efforts to halt the economic slide . cracks have emerged between the united states and europe over whether the gathering should focus on short-term stimulus or broader financial regulation to stop future crises . euro zone contraction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the outlook for asia is particularly bleak the imf slashed its growth predictions by at least 1 percent for all regions compared to its january forecast .
the united states , the world 's largest economy , will shrink 2.6 percent over 2009 and is unlikely to return to positive growth until the third quarter of 2010 , the imf said . european countries that have adopted the euro will contract 3.2 percent this year and japan 's economic output will tumble 5.8 percent , wiping out the country 's gains made over the last four years . emerging and developing countries will still post modest growth of 1.5 to 2.5 percent this year and recover to between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent in 2010 . the report warned that ending the financial crisis was a " necessary condition " for the global economy 's recovery . the imf said europe should be more aggressive in adopting fiscal stimulus measures , especially for 2010 when the recession is expected to continue .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .

bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 'll stay in the friedland camp , which has housed 4 million refugees since world war ii . the refugee camp at friedland was established on the border between the british and soviet zones .
british troops took over a research farm formerly owned by goettingen university , and the area was officially named a " border crossing camp " on sept .
20 , 1945 .
it has been under the control of the state of lower saxony since 1948 .
historically , it was the place where people from the soviet-controlled east entered the west .
among them were refugees , displaced people and ethnic germans from the formerly german-controlled areas in the east , as well as soviet prisoners of war trying to return home .
the last 10,000 of them reached the border station in 1955 - ten years after the war had ended .
in the soviet union they were seen as war criminals and showed up once diplomatic relations between the ussr and west germany were opened .
pieces of a puzzle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the camp was founded on the border between the british and soviet zones after the creation of the two german states in 1949 , the friedland camp remained an initial destination for migrants from east germany and so-called late german repatriates - germans from russia and eastern europe who returned to germany years or decades after the war ended .
in friedland , there was a multitude of data about millions of repatriates , emigrants and others returning home as well as over 200,000 german prisoners of war .
german governmental departments put this material to good use , but it was also looked upon with great interest by secret services from all over the west , who interrogated all of the new arrivals .
each person coming from the east carried with bits of information , which were important to the military in developing of larger picture of their cold war enemy .
after the iron curtain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,500 iraqis , many of them christians , will start a new life in germany more than four million people have passed through the camp , which many considered their gateway to freedom .
starting in 1990 , emigrants from former soviet satellite countries have made up the majority of arrivals .
since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .
since its origins , friedland has seen a host of refugees from many countries .
in 1956 , 3,000 hungarians , who had fled their homeland after a failed uprising , arrived at the camp .
chileans suffering from political persecution after the pinochet took control of chile in a coup on sept .
11 , 1973 also made their way there .
later the camp became the first stop in germany for so-called boat people from vietnam , tamils from sri lanka , refugees from albania and , as of 2009 , refugees from iraq .

that is down from a january prediction of 0.5 percent growth . " global economic activity is falling - with advanced economies registering their sharpest declines in the post-war era - notwithstanding forceful policy efforts , " the imf said in a staff report made public on thursday , march 19 . in a critical report ahead of next month 's group of 20 summit of the world 's major economies , the international financial watchdog painted a depressing picture of the state of the global economy and said the government response has been too little and come too late .

since that time the camp has been the site of integration courses for those coming to germany .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed .

fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .

" the danger remains very high that -lrb- fritzl -rrb- will commit more offenses if he is not treated , " psychiatrist adelheid kastner told the court . " he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 19.03.2009 first group of iraqi refugees arrives in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iraqi refugees are hoping for a better life in germany more than 100 iraqi christians have arrived in hanover .
they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

they 're the first wave of a contingent of 2,500 iraqis expected to relocate to germany as part of a program sponsored by the unhcr . the first group of iraqis to arrive in germany had previously been living in refugee camps in jordan and syria .
upon their arrival on thursday , march 19 , they will initially be housed in northern germany and issued with three-year , extendable residency permits .
that means their chances of successfully integrating into their new community in germany will be better than many other iraqi refugees who 've been here for much longer , but who 've been forced to live on the periphery of society , asylum experts say .
many of them have only a duldung - a certificate that states that they are in germany illegally , and that their deportation has been put off indefinitely .
the continuing civil war in iraq prevents refugees from being sent back to their homeland ; a situation that is n't likely to change anytime soon .
" we think that it is only fair to issue the iraqis who are living here illegally with a residency permit , " said kai weber of the refugee council in the state of lower saxony .
weber would like to spare asylum seekers a fate like that of ghassan el-zuhairy , an iraqi who fled his country in 2002 and his since been living in lower saxony without a residency permit .
because of his status , he is not allowed to move freely within germany - a restriction that cost the trained metal worker his job once it became clear he would not be able to travel to other german states to deliver parts to customers .
now , el-zuhairy is on welfare , and deeply unhappy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghassan el-zuhairy has been disappointed by his experience in germany " i do n't have any plans at the moment , " he said .
" i ca n't live without goals , because i get ill - mentally ill . "
el-zuhairy took it upon himself to learn german because his status does n't give him the right to attend german language classes .
it 's an intolerable situation , weber said , referring to the iraqi refugees now arriving from syria and jordan .
" you ca n't say that because of the situation in iraq we 'll take in these victims of war , while at the same time , you 're thinking concretely of how you can one day send them back to their country , " weber said .
" from our point of view , this just does n't work .
we have to have a concept of how to offer these iraqis a real chance at a life in germany . "
germany must do more , expert says while lower saxony 's refugee council welcomes the german government 's willingness to resettle 2,500 iraqis , weber says that number is just a drop in the ocean when seen against the 2.5 million iraqis in refugee camps in syria and jordan .
" it does n't really help to ease the suffering , but it 's a sign of good will , " he said .
" but we should n't leave it at that .
to really make a difference , germany should take in 10 times that amount . "
in total , the resettlement program sponsored by the un high commissioner for refugees will help 10,000 iraqis relocate to germany and elsewhere in europe .
britain , denmark , finland the netherlands , norway and sweden are also involved in the scheme .
most of those receiving help from germany are members of iraq 's christian minority , which has faced years of violence and intimidation from islamic extremists .
the people selected to take part in the program must fit criteria established by the german government and the eu .
they must have a clean criminal record , for example , and not have been members of saddam hussein 's former baath party .
single mothers , post-traumatic stress sufferers and those with family ties to germany also had a greater chance of a successful application .

on wednesday , josef fritzl pleaded guilty to all charges including murder . josef fritzl dramatically changed his plea on wednesday to being guilty of enslavement and murder , a charge that carries the highest penalty in austria .
one of the seven children fritzl had with his daughter elisabeth , died of medical complications shortly after birth . in addition to enslavement and murder , fritzl was also charged with incest and the rape of his now 42-year-old daughter .
he had pleaded guilty to these crimes on monday .
the length of sentencing in austria is not based on an accumulation of all charges , but the longest sentence is handed down for only one of the crimes committed . " i plead guilty to the crimes i 've been charged with , " fritzl told the court in the northern austrian city st. poelten . initially denied murder charge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritzl hid his face for the first two days of trial .
fritzl had initially said the infant was still-born and that he had disposed of the corpse in an incinerator .
prosecutors charged fritzl with causing the death in 1996 by denying the baby boy medical treatment that would have required hospitalization . " i do n't know why i did n't help , " fritzl told the court on wednesday .
" i should have noticed that the baby was not doing well .
i just hoped it would survive . " testimony triggered change of heart when the judge asked him what triggered the change , fritzl replied " my daughter 's videotaped testimony . " elisabeth fritzl was not required to personally appear in court , but had given an 11-hour video testimony in which she described the years she spent in a damp , windowless bunker beneath the family home without hot water and heating .

" he must continue to be treated until he can no longer be classified as dangerous . " in a 130-page report made available to the prosecution before the trial , kastner had concluded that fritzl suffered from serious personality disorders , but was nonetheless sane enough to be responsible for the crimes he committed .

mayer argued that his client genuinely cared about his daughter and the children they had , who are also his grandchildren .
mayer said fritzl had only wanted a second family . the incest case made sensational headlines around the world and has attracted hundreds of journalists to st. poelten .
initially conducted in closed sessions to protect the victims ' privacy , the trial was opened to the public on wednesday . for the first time since the trial began , fritzl entered the courthouse without shielding his face behind a blue binder .
the hearings concluded on wednesday morning when the three judges retired to discuss several points for the eight-member jury to consider before rendering a verdict . the court is expected to sentence fritzl after the prosecution and defense make their closing statements on thursday . df / sms / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bayern forced to rely on eternal substitute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince was successful recently in the champions league against sporting lisbon especially podolski , klinsmann might have said .
but the 23-year-old , who is headed back to his home club cologne at the end of the season , has scored only four league goals this season - two of them from penalty kicks and none that were game-winners .
that 's partly due to the fact that he 's only played 15 games this season , and in eight of those he only came on as a second-half substitute .
klinsmann is hoping that podolski wants - and is able - to add a happy ending to his unhappy three-season tenure in munich .
" lukas aims to leave with an exclamation point , " klinsmann told the bild newspaper before last weekend 's bochum match .
" he wants to show that he can play at our level . "
but podolski failed to score against bochum , pulling his best chance - a penalty , wide of goal .
and that means bayern are in a precarious position .
currently trailing league leaders hertha berlin by four points , and leading wolfsburg and hamburg only on goal difference , the reigning champs ca n't afford to drop too many more points .
podolski rediscovers scoring touch but podolski has found the net in bayern 's recent international matches , drawing praise from germany 's national coach .
" lukas clearly has used his chance - and not just with three goals in his last three games , " germany coach joachim loew told sid .
" you have to be prepared for moments like this as a substitute player . "
barring injury , podolski will almost certainly make the starting eleven for bayern 's next match against last-placed karlsruhe .

the 73-year-old accepted the verdicts and waived his right to appeal . court officials in st. poelten , west of vienna , said fritzl would be held in a regional prison pending a transfer to a secure psychiatric facility . they said if he were found to be rehabilitated , he would , in theory , serve the remainder of his sentence in prison . before the verdict had been announced , fritzl had made a last expression of remorse .

many nations are turning to nuclear power to reduce dependence on oil and gas imports .
brussels is committed to further nuclear research , but eu members are divided . nuclear energy is currently used in 31 countries around the world .
according to data from germany 's federal economics ministry , a total of 444 nuclear energy plants produce have a gross output of 390,000 megawatts .
worldwide , nuclear power accounts for 17 percent of energy production , while this percentage inside the eu is 31 percent . following a referendum held over 20 years ago , italy is the only g8 country which does not use nuclear power .
but after an energy policy reversal under conservative leader silvio berlusconi , italy will resume building nuclear energy plants , with foundations being laid for up to five 1,800 megawatt-capacity-plants by 2013 . the first country to use nuclear power on a large scale for civilian purposes was great britain .
the first nuclear power plant went onto the grid there in 1956 .
there are currently 19 reactors in operation across britain , which produce about 15 percent of the nation 's energy .
due to rising oil prices and the effects of climate change , london has begun relying more heavily on nuclear power .
new energy legislation should make it easier to build planned new reactors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is home to a strong anti-nuclear movement with nuclear energy providing about 77 percent of its energy , france relies on nuclear reactors to a far greater extent than any other eu member .
since the oil crisis of 1973 , numerous reactors have been built to turn the country into an energy autocrat .
france currently operates 59 nuclear reactors , and a further reactor is under construction .
french president nicolas sarkozy is also a strong supporter of the export of french nuclear technology . some in germany rethinking phase-out in germany , 17 reactors currently supply around a quarter of the nation 's energy .
in 2000 , the coalition of social democrats and greens committed to a nuclear phase-out agreement , under which no new reactors are allowed to be built .
by 2021 , all the country 's reactors are to be taken off the grid .
however , if successful in general elections in september of 2009 , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union would reverse the phase-out .
the party also wants to extend the lifetimes of " safe reactors , " though the construction of new reactors is not yet up for debate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria may count on nuclear power to reduce its dependency on russian energy to become less dependent on russian deliveries of gas and oil , eastern european countries are also increasingly turning to nuclear power .
bulgaria , which sources 95 percent of its energy from russia , has decided to restart two dormant soviet-era reactors in the kosloduj nuclear power plant .
the controversial reactors were shut down due to security concerns in 2007 , prior to the country 's entry into the eu , in order to comply with an eu directive . the czech republic has also shown itself to be open towards nuclear energy .
the temelin nuclear power plant - located around 100 km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- from the border with germany and austria - is to be expanded from two to four reactors .
temelin , in its current form , is already a bone of contention in relations with nuclear-free austria . in austria 's view , the future ought to be defined by energy-saving measures , renewable energies , and more efficient use of conventional energy sources such as coal , oil and gas . author : olja melnik / deanne corbett editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latest figures from the aa show the price of petrol at the pumps has fallen slightly in the last four weeks .
but it is set to rise again when a planned government increase in fuel duty takes effect on 1 april .
the increase was originally planned for last april but has been postponed twice because of soaring crude oil prices .
between mid-february and mid-march the average uk price of petrol fell from 90.88p a litre to 90.56p , says the motoring organisation .

when sharon mills talks about the " horrific " effects e.coli had on her son , she looks haunted .
as she lists the catalogue of pain and suffering mason endured before he died , it is hard to comprehend that the five-year-old picked up the food poisoning bug from contaminated meat served at his school .
but sharon , from deri , in bargoed , caerphilly county , is all too aware of the causes of the illness that led to her son 's death in 2005 .
and as a report is published from the public inquiry into the outbreak , which affected 157 people , she faces a future knowing that , while it may help others , it is too late for her family .
" e.coli is a very nasty thing .
it just seeps through the body , " she told bbc wales ' week in week out programme .
" in mason 's case part of his kidneys had died , his intestines were eaten away .
if he had survived , he would have had to be drip fed , he would n't be the same child . "
because mason suffered terribly , it was horrific to see what he had to go through .
i think people really need to be aware of that now " sharon mills " maybe he would have faced life in a wheelchair or another scenario was he might have been in hospital for the rest of his life .
" mason suffered seizures , suffered blood poisoning , it shut down his veins , stopped his urine output .
" it can have very bad consequences concerning brain damage .
it can affect the eye sight , it can lead them to go blind .
it 's got terrible , terrible outcomes . "
she added : " because mason suffered terribly , it was horrific to see what he had to go through .
i think people really need to be aware of that now . "
she said life will never be the same for her again .
seeing children mason 's age , seeing his old school friends and tucking her other two children into bed each night - and not their brother - is now " mental torture all the time " .
" the normal things that so many families take for granted and i have lost it , " she added .
" i have lost any normality that i had . "
' panic mode ' garyn price was luckier than mason - although he still suffers from the effects of the e.coli bug he contracted .
the 13-year-old , who lives in caerphilly , is no stranger to illness or pain , having suffered a stroke when he was six .
but what made his second illness so hard to bear was the fact that it could have been prevented , his mother julie said .
" the pain of e.coli was much worse than what happened in 2002 with the stroke , " she said .
" it 's something that could have been avoided .
that was the bitterest pill for all of us , including garyn , to swallow .
" that all this was down to somebody cutting corners and not being hygienic .
that was very , very hard to take . "
" i 'm not really over it yet .
i worry about if it 's going to happen again to someone else " garyn price garyn suffered renal failure and had to be airlifted to alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool for treatment .
it is something that still affects him .
" psychologically , garyn is still paranoid about where he gets takeaways from , what he eats " said mrs price .
" if he gets an upset stomach , just slightly upset stomach , he goes into complete panic mode , you know ' have i got e.coli ? ' which sometimes we try to brush over but at the end of the day he 's 13-years-old , he should n't have to worry about things like that . "
garyn , who is now in secondary school , said he still has worries about the illness .
" i thought i was going to die .
the needles were n't all that bad because i was used to them but it was really frightening , " he said .
" i 'm not really over it yet .
i worry about if it 's going to happen again to someone else , you know ?
and if it might happen around here again and my friends might have it . "

when sharon mills talks about the " horrific " effects e.coli had on her son , she looks haunted .
as she lists the catalogue of pain and suffering mason endured before he died , it is hard to comprehend that the five-year-old picked up the food poisoning bug from contaminated meat served at his school .
but sharon , from deri , in bargoed , caerphilly county , is all too aware of the causes of the illness that led to her son 's death in 2005 .
and as a report is published from the public inquiry into the outbreak , which affected 157 people , she faces a future knowing that , while it may help others , it is too late for her family .
" e.coli is a very nasty thing .
it just seeps through the body , " she told bbc wales ' week in week out programme .
" in mason 's case part of his kidneys had died , his intestines were eaten away .
if he had survived , he would have had to be drip fed , he would n't be the same child .
because mason suffered terribly , it was horrific to see what he had to go through .
i think people really need to be aware of that now sharon mills " maybe he would have faced life in a wheelchair or another scenario was he might have been in hospital for the rest of his life .
" mason suffered seizures , suffered blood poisoning , it shut down his veins , stopped his urine output .
" it can have very bad consequences concerning brain damage .
it can affect the eye sight , it can lead them to go blind .
it 's got terrible , terrible outcomes . "
she added : " because mason suffered terribly , it was horrific to see what he had to go through .
i think people really need to be aware of that now . "
she said life will never be the same for her again .
seeing children mason 's age , seeing his old school friends and tucking her other two children into bed each night - and not their brother - is now " mental torture all the time " .
" the normal things that so many families take for granted and i have lost it , " she added .
" i have lost any normality that i had . "
' panic mode ' garyn price was luckier than mason - although he still suffers from the effects of the e.coli bug he contracted .
the 13-year-old , who lives in caerphilly , is no stranger to illness or pain , having suffered a stroke when he was six .
but what made his second illness so hard to bear was the fact that it could have been prevented , his mother julie said .
" the pain of e.coli was much worse than what happened in 2002 with the stroke , " she said .
" it 's something that could have been avoided .
that was the bitterest pill for all of us , including garyn , to swallow .
" that all this was down to somebody cutting corners and not being hygienic .
that was very , very hard to take . "
i 'm not really over it yet .
i worry about if it 's going to happen again to someone else garyn price garyn suffered renal failure and had to be airlifted to alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool for treatment .
it is something that still affects him .
" psychologically , garyn is still paranoid about where he gets takeaways from , what he eats " said mrs price .
" if he gets an upset stomach , just slightly upset stomach , he goes into complete panic mode , you know ' have i got e.coli ? ' which sometimes we try to brush over but at the end of the day he 's 13-years-old , he should n't have to worry about things like that . "
garyn , who is now in secondary school , said he still has worries about the illness .
" i thought i was going to die .
the needles were n't all that bad because i was used to them but it was really frightening , " he said .
" i 'm not really over it yet .
i worry about if it 's going to happen again to someone else , you know ?
and if it might happen around here again and my friends might have it . "
week in week out will be on bbc one wales at 2100 gmt on thursday .
