he held a number of executive positions at goldman sachs and was a senior director from 2003 until his retirement in 2006 .
his nomination continues a pattern of naming high-profile fundraisers and contributors to the democrats to choice ambassadorial posts , a long-standing political tradition in the united states for the party in power .
it was reported in germany 's der spiegel magazine earlier this month that the german president 's office had given an official nod of approval to murphy 's nomination , which had first been mooted in may .
it is very rare for an ambassadorial nomination to be rejected by the host nation .
murphy to end six-month long absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of timken 's tenure left a six-month gap in berlin the us has been without an ambassador to germany for the first six months of the obama presidency , after william r. timken relinquished the post at the end of president george w. bush 's administration .
the white house has attributed the delay to stringent new review procedures in the filling of top posts in the obama administration .
an embarrassing tax scandal at the turn of the year led the new government to enforce even stricter checks , slowing the process down further .
murphy must still wait until the us senate confirms his appointment before officially taking up his new job in berlin. nda / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .

he held a number of executive positions at goldman sachs and was a senior director from 2003 until his retirement in 2006 .
his nomination continues a pattern of naming high-profile fundraisers and contributors to the democrats to choice ambassadorial posts , a long-standing political tradition in the united states for the party in power .
it was reported in germany 's der spiegel magazine earlier this month that the german president 's office had given an official nod of approval to murphy 's nomination , which had first been mooted in may .
it is very rare for an ambassadorial nomination to be rejected by the host nation .
murphy to end six-month long absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of timken 's tenure left a six-month gap in berlin the us has been without an ambassador to germany for the first six months of the obama presidency , after william r. timken relinquished the post at the end of president george w. bush 's administration .
the white house has attributed the delay to stringent new review procedures in the filling of top posts in the obama administration .
an embarrassing tax scandal at the turn of the year led the new government to enforce even stricter checks , slowing the process down further .
murphy must still wait until the us senate confirms his appointment before officially taking up his new job in berlin. nda / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 10.07.2009 bavaria gives in on farm subsidies data to avoid eu legal challenge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmers say the eu rules threaten their privacy in a move that should halt any attempt by the eu to sue germany over its agricultural subsidies , bavaria said on thursday it will publish data next month which shows how much its farmers receive in european handouts . bavarian agriculture minister helmut brunner made the announcement following a visit to munich , the capital of the southern german state , by european agriculture commissioner mariann fischer-boel .
" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "

" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .

" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu takes legal action against germany over farm subsidies the european commission has officially opened legal proceedings against germany over the southern state of bavaria 's failure to publish data on the recipients of eu agricultural subsidies .
-lrb- 25.06.2009 -rrb- germany discloses data on farm subsidies to avoid eu penalty germany has become the last eu country to disclose the beneficiaries of the bloc 's generous farm subsidies .

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .
" the protection of the rights of female sex workers must be added to the prostitution law , " said beate pollert-ebinger , a spokeswoman for the " aktionsbuendnis gegen sex-flatrates , " a political action group opposed flat-rate sex services .

" nobody is being forced to do anything … i 'm not aware of any pimps , " said brothel manager patricia f. , who is also in charge of the three other flat-rate brothels across germany . police also became involved when stuttgart 's district attorney 's office received a complaint against the club for prostitute exploitation .

" we have talked to the owner but presently have no reason to take action , " said a spokesperson for the waiblinger police department .

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .

" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day .

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .

the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .

he held a number of executive positions at goldman sachs and was a senior director from 2003 until his retirement in 2006 .
his nomination continues a pattern of naming high-profile fundraisers and contributors to the democrats to choice ambassadorial posts , a long-standing political tradition in the united states for the party in power .
it was reported in germany 's der spiegel magazine earlier this month that the german president 's office had given an official nod of approval to murphy 's nomination , which had first been mooted in may .
it is very rare for an ambassadorial nomination to be rejected by the host nation .

the white house has attributed the delay to stringent new review procedures in the filling of top posts in the obama administration .
an embarrassing tax scandal at the turn of the year led the new government to enforce even stricter checks , slowing the process down further .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "

" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .

" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .
" the protection of the rights of female sex workers must be added to the prostitution law , " said beate pollert-ebinger , a spokeswoman for the " aktionsbuendnis gegen sex-flatrates , " a political action group opposed flat-rate sex services .
bringing protection to those in need bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flat-rate brothel in fellbach is the fourth such establishment in germany when the prostitution law first took effect , the intent was to improve the social and legal rights of prostitutes .
as a result these nearly 400,000 men and women have access to social insurance , employment contracts and vacation days . however , many officials and politicians also had a critical view when stuttgart became the fourth german city to join berlin , wuppertal and heidelberg to open a flat-rate brothel .
" nobody is being forced to do anything … i 'm not aware of any pimps , " said brothel manager patricia f. , who is also in charge of the three other flat-rate brothels across germany . police also became involved when stuttgart 's district attorney 's office received a complaint against the club for prostitute exploitation .
but , while police can continue to keep an eye on the brothel , the authorities are essentially powerless .
" we have talked to the owner but presently have no reason to take action , " said a spokesperson for the waiblinger police department .
it 's a question of free will according to their contract , the women can decide which customers to work with and choose what practices to offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic nun lea ackermann fights sex tourism and human trafficking but catholic nun lea ackermann says the law is not protecting the prostitutes as advertised .
she has spent a lot of time fighting sex tourism and human trafficking through her association , solwodi .
" the women are subject to almost complete supervision through video surveillance and security guards .
the sexual practices are mandatory ; customers can not be rejected , " she said .
yet , according to patricia f. , the rate at which the women get paid depends on what they are willing to do .
the free-will of the sex workers is at the heart of the problem for activists like solwodi spokeswoman carol filter .
in the past it was easy to tell when sex workers were being coerced due to physical evidence of abuse , she said .
" these days the perpetrators use more subtle methods , " filter said , " for example , there is the ' loverboy trick ' that pimps use to make young eastern european girls from usually broken homes fall in love with them . "

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .

" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day .

wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investigators will look for clues at several schools and universities as to whether muslim groups are showing signs of radicalization . despite the new precautions , hanning warned against being alarmist . he said security authorities had been able to prevent six attacks on german soil since 2000 . jam / dpa / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .

later , he dedicated himself to composing film music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 10.07.2009 german cabaret popolski tackles polish stereotypes with humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popolski brothers claim their polish family invented pop music germany and poland do n't have the smoothest neighborly history .
but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

security officials say the terror threat has increased . authorities say they are taking the threat of possible terrorist violence before the fall elections seriously , although a spokesman for the current chair of the german interior minister 's conferences said there is " no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot at present . " still , deputy interior minister august hanning indicated last week that terrorists could use attacks to try to force germany to pull its forces out of afghanistan , where they are engaged in peacekeeping operations . according to the spiegel online site , the package of measures resembles stepped-up security that was put into place before the soccer world cup that germany hosted in 2006 . airports and borders for example , police will increase efforts at airports and borders to intercept people returning from stays in terrorist training camps in afghanistan and pakistan .
at the same time , outbound journeys of those suspected of having been recruited by terror organizations will be closely examined and perhaps stopped . authorities are also planning to visit some 140 islamists who are suspected of inciting violence , and to examine their activities closely .
investigators will look for clues at several schools and universities as to whether muslim groups are showing signs of radicalization . despite the new precautions , hanning warned against being alarmist . he said security authorities had been able to prevent six attacks on german soil since 2000 . jam / dpa / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 10.07.2009 german cabaret popolski tackles polish stereotypes with humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popolski brothers claim their polish family invented pop music germany and poland do n't have the smoothest neighborly history .
but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "

that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?

" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

security officials say the terror threat has increased . authorities say they are taking the threat of possible terrorist violence before the fall elections seriously , although a spokesman for the current chair of the german interior minister 's conferences said there is " no concrete evidence of a terrorist plot at present . " still , deputy interior minister august hanning indicated last week that terrorists could use attacks to try to force germany to pull its forces out of afghanistan , where they are engaged in peacekeeping operations . according to the spiegel online site , the package of measures resembles stepped-up security that was put into place before the soccer world cup that germany hosted in 2006 . airports and borders for example , police will increase efforts at airports and borders to intercept people returning from stays in terrorist training camps in afghanistan and pakistan .
at the same time , outbound journeys of those suspected of having been recruited by terror organizations will be closely examined and perhaps stopped . authorities are also planning to visit some 140 islamists who are suspected of inciting violence , and to examine their activities closely .
investigators will look for clues at several schools and universities as to whether muslim groups are showing signs of radicalization . despite the new precautions , hanning warned against being alarmist . he said security authorities had been able to prevent six attacks on german soil since 2000 . jam / dpa / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .
" the protection of the rights of female sex workers must be added to the prostitution law , " said beate pollert-ebinger , a spokeswoman for the " aktionsbuendnis gegen sex-flatrates , " a political action group opposed flat-rate sex services .
bringing protection to those in need bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flat-rate brothel in fellbach is the fourth such establishment in germany when the prostitution law first took effect , the intent was to improve the social and legal rights of prostitutes .
as a result these nearly 400,000 men and women have access to social insurance , employment contracts and vacation days . however , many officials and politicians also had a critical view when stuttgart became the fourth german city to join berlin , wuppertal and heidelberg to open a flat-rate brothel .
" nobody is being forced to do anything … i 'm not aware of any pimps , " said brothel manager patricia f. , who is also in charge of the three other flat-rate brothels across germany . police also became involved when stuttgart 's district attorney 's office received a complaint against the club for prostitute exploitation .
but , while police can continue to keep an eye on the brothel , the authorities are essentially powerless .
" we have talked to the owner but presently have no reason to take action , " said a spokesperson for the waiblinger police department .
it 's a question of free will according to their contract , the women can decide which customers to work with and choose what practices to offer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : catholic nun lea ackermann fights sex tourism and human trafficking but catholic nun lea ackermann says the law is not protecting the prostitutes as advertised .
she has spent a lot of time fighting sex tourism and human trafficking through her association , solwodi .
" the women are subject to almost complete supervision through video surveillance and security guards .
the sexual practices are mandatory ; customers can not be rejected , " she said .
yet , according to patricia f. , the rate at which the women get paid depends on what they are willing to do .
the free-will of the sex workers is at the heart of the problem for activists like solwodi spokeswoman carol filter .
in the past it was easy to tell when sex workers were being coerced due to physical evidence of abuse , she said .
" these days the perpetrators use more subtle methods , " filter said , " for example , there is the ' loverboy trick ' that pimps use to make young eastern european girls from usually broken homes fall in love with them . "
" because they 're yearning for love , they would do anything for these guys , " filter said , " and that would seem like free will . " mo / sjt / dpa / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 10.07.2009 german cabaret popolski tackles polish stereotypes with humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popolski brothers claim their polish family invented pop music germany and poland do n't have the smoothest neighborly history .
but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 10.07.2009 german cabaret popolski tackles polish stereotypes with humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popolski brothers claim their polish family invented pop music germany and poland do n't have the smoothest neighborly history .
but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet , according to patricia f. , the rate at which the women get paid depends on what they are willing to do .
the free-will of the sex workers is at the heart of the problem for activists like solwodi spokeswoman carol filter .
in the past it was easy to tell when sex workers were being coerced due to physical evidence of abuse , she said .
" these days the perpetrators use more subtle methods , " filter said , " for example , there is the ' loverboy trick ' that pimps use to make young eastern european girls from usually broken homes fall in love with them . "
" because they 're yearning for love , they would do anything for these guys , " filter said , " and that would seem like free will . " mo / sjt / dpa / epd editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .

" still , deputy interior minister august hanning indicated last week that terrorists could use attacks to try to force germany to pull its forces out of afghanistan , where they are engaged in peacekeeping operations . according to the spiegel online site , the package of measures resembles stepped-up security that was put into place before the soccer world cup that germany hosted in 2006 . airports and borders for example , police will increase efforts at airports and borders to intercept people returning from stays in terrorist training camps in afghanistan and pakistan .
at the same time , outbound journeys of those suspected of having been recruited by terror organizations will be closely examined and perhaps stopped . authorities are also planning to visit some 140 islamists who are suspected of inciting violence , and to examine their activities closely .
investigators will look for clues at several schools and universities as to whether muslim groups are showing signs of radicalization . despite the new precautions , hanning warned against being alarmist . he said security authorities had been able to prevent six attacks on german soil since 2000 . jam / dpa / ap editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 10.07.2009 g-8 agrees on $ 20 billion food security package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 has joined forces with the g-5 and african countries to tackle hunger the g-8 has agreed a $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.3 billion euros -rrb- aid and security package to fight global hunger and promote more productive farming in the world 's poorest countries . the package , largely funded by the united states and japan , was approved by the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- leading developed economies , the group of five -lrb- g-5 -rrb- top developing states , and african leaders on the third and last day of a summit in the italian city of l 'aquila , diplomats said .
the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .

a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .
" the protection of the rights of female sex workers must be added to the prostitution law , " said beate pollert-ebinger , a spokeswoman for the " aktionsbuendnis gegen sex-flatrates , " a political action group opposed flat-rate sex services .

" nobody is being forced to do anything … i 'm not aware of any pimps , " said brothel manager patricia f. , who is also in charge of the three other flat-rate brothels across germany . police also became involved when stuttgart 's district attorney 's office received a complaint against the club for prostitute exploitation .

while the tradition may be dying out , a small group of talented young people are still drawn to the musical art form . in nearly every city in the benelux countries of belgium , the netherlands , and luxembourg there is a carillon - a stationary set of around 23 separate bells of varying sizes , usually housed in towers and churches .
a carillon player , known as a carillonneur , plays the instrument with a large keyboard which then pulls the bells clapper to produce sound . many carillonneurs learned their craft at the royal carillon school in mechelen , belgium .
it is one of the most famous and oldest schools dedicated to teaching carillon and only accepts a handful of students each year . geert hellemans , a 33 year-old belgian high school teacher , has spent the last 10 years studying part-time to become a qualified carillonneur .
he is just one of four international students studying at the royal carillon school , with the others coming from australia , hong kong and russia . an artistic science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing a lot can be painful hellemans has to climb up 400 steps to reach his practice location in the sind romuald cathedral . some of the bells are several meters wide . " the largest bells are beneath the player and upstairs and overhead are the smaller bells , " said hellemans .
" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that way you are not disturbed while playing by the sounds of the larger bells .
and this gives a good mixture of sound to the people underneath . " to play , the carillonneur sits at a long bench and clenches their hands into fists and strikes long wooden keys called batons .
simultaneously , they push pedals on the pedal board with their feet to move the clappers that strike and sound the bells . the carillonneur has to think about the height of the tower , the type of bells and how the windows will let out the sound when striking the keys . isaac wong , a 28-year-old carillon student from australia , thinks the small playing room at the top of the tower is one of the most beautiful places to be . " you become part of that environment , " he said .
" i think it 's very therapeutic , it 's something that makes me calm and it definitely makes me feel positive about myself . " wong was studying carillon in australia but the belgian school 's reputation drew him to mechelen for one year of intensive study . no pain , no gain he said learning to play can be painful in the beginning , as the carillon keyboard is connected to bells that can weigh up to several tons . " sometimes it hurts , especially in the lead up to the exams , " said wong .
" when i was practicing for a couple of hours every day , at the end of the day i felt so sore that the only remedy was to give myself a break and not play for a day . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carillons can be heard chiming in churches and cathedrals in an exam , the teachers stand in the open so they can listen for technical precision , quality of sound and artistic interpretation . each examinee has to play for 45 minutes , performing both classical and modern pieces as well as a composition of their own .
wong said he had arranged some pop songs from asian countries like japan and hong kong . " if something is very popular and i like it then i would try to play it on the carillon , " he added . dedication to art all four of the foreign students have passed their final exam at the royal carillon school and wong and hellemans even earned " distinctions . " wong plans to return to sydney and pass on new techniques to the carillonneurs in his home country .
hellemans hopes to be hired to play in belgium and around europe where professional carillonneurs get the opportunity to play one or two hours per week , usual on sundays . that does n't quite make for a lucrative career , but at least he 's now a graduate from one of the oldest and most recognized carillon schools in the world . author : nina plonka / cheryl northey editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?

" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .
other laws passed included one that reinforces banking clients ' rights , another which would curb executive pay and call for fines for cases of egregious mismanagement , and a law meant to expand the power of financial regulators the bundesrat also formally adopted a finance law that would see the country 's public deficit reach 49.1 billion euros in 2009 , its highest in 23 years .
in matters of social policy , the bundesrat gave its stamp of approval to two measures already passed by the bundestag .
the legal minimum age for the use of high-caliber firearms is to be raised from 14 to 18 , and all guns must be registered in a new central database by 2012 .
a controversial new law meant to fight the distribution of child pornography on the internet was also passed .
it calls for web sites suspected of trafficking in child porn to be made un-viewable in germany , replaced by a screen displaying a stop sign. mrh / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .

" nobody is being forced to do anything … i 'm not aware of any pimps , " said brothel manager patricia f. , who is also in charge of the three other flat-rate brothels across germany . police also became involved when stuttgart 's district attorney 's office received a complaint against the club for prostitute exploitation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 10.07.2009 g-8 agrees on $ 20 billion food security package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 has joined forces with the g-5 and african countries to tackle hunger the g-8 has agreed a $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.3 billion euros -rrb- aid and security package to fight global hunger and promote more productive farming in the world 's poorest countries . the package , largely funded by the united states and japan , was approved by the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- leading developed economies , the group of five -lrb- g-5 -rrb- top developing states , and african leaders on the third and last day of a summit in the italian city of l 'aquila , diplomats said .
the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tumult emerged after a flat-rate brothel in stuttgart encountered resistance from citizens and women 's rights organizations .
in an open letter to politicians , including german chancellor angela merkel , critics called for changes to the prostitution law established in 2002 , saying that it degraded women .
the uproar began with the establishment of a flat-rate brothel in fellbach , near stuttgart , in june .
according to its ad , the brothel invites customers to pay a flat-rate of 100 euros for an all-inclusive offer of food , drinks and prostitution services .
" the protection of the rights of female sex workers must be added to the prostitution law , " said beate pollert-ebinger , a spokeswoman for the " aktionsbuendnis gegen sex-flatrates , " a political action group opposed flat-rate sex services .

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .
it 's just the opposite : i think after they see the show everyone feels like going to poland . " author : iwona metzner / kate bowen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on friday , however , she announced that she wo n't be going and plans instead stay in her current job . meglena kuneva decided to remain the european commissioner for consumer protection instead of taking her seat in the parliament . kuneva 's term as commissioner ends in october but she would have had to resign from that position in order to be sworn in to the new parliament next week .
“ i have taken my decision ...
i will complete my term as commissioner , ” she told a news conference in sofia .
in the european parliamentary elections on june 7 , kuneva was elected as deputy for the liberal nmsp party of former bulgarian king simeon saxe coburg , which is part of the alliance of liberals and democrats for europe .
kuneva said this decision came after talks with european commission president jose manuel borroso and bulgaria 's prime minister-designate , boyko borisov .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instead , she wants to keep her job at the european commission in brussels what does the future hold ?
when asked if she planned to seek backing from the new government for a second term in the eu commission , kuneva said : “ this is not a matter of my immediate efforts . ”
before this announcement , borisov had said that he would n't be asking for a new mandate for the european commissioner for consumer affairs after kuneva left the post .
this was part of a plan to curb spending and releasing 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- frozen last year by the european commission over concerns of fraud and poor management .
however , according to bulgarian media , borisov is now planning to nominate another mep , rumyana zheleva , a member of his center-right gerb party , as bulgaria 's next representative at the commission. sjt / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the bundesrat 's last session before adjourning for the summer -lrb- and the last before parliamentary elections in september -rrb- , lawmakers passed a plan to allow banks to trade bad assets for guaranteed bonds worth 90 percent of their value .
up to 230 billion euros of bad assets could be offloaded into separate entities , allowing the banks to clear their balance sheets and shift available funds from reserves used to cover the bad assets toward lending .
additionally , the government bonds the banks receive in exchange would be worth more on the open market and could raise capital themselves .
banks are to pay the costs of setting up the so-called " bad banks , " as well as a fee for the guaranteed bonds .
the impetus for the measure is a perception that germany risks a freeze in credit if banks ' debt burdens are not eased .
finance minister peer steinbrueck , in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , said " we must take seriously , very seriously , the threat of a credit crunch in the second half of the year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck does n't want to take chances much more in store meanwhile , german lawmakers also passed anti-tax evasion legislation that would let authorities demand more information from companies and individuals operating in countries that fall short of oecd standards on banking secrecy .

the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the first payments have already arrived , " said quelle chairman konrad hilbers on friday .
the mail-order retailer , based in the bavarian city of fuerth , made a key deadline in securing the cash .
it could no longer pay its shipping charges and had fallen behind on its bills to complete its print run , meaning it would have had to scrap plans to mail out its main fall / winter calendar had the money not come through .
quelle , which has been in operation since 1927 and has offered thousands of items from sweaters to hair dryers to germans via catalog for more than 50 years , reported that the money will allow the company to return to business as usual by the middle of the coming week .
who 's paying ?
essen-based valvois bank , along with at least two others - the state bank of bavaria and frankfurt 's commerzbank - are involved in the new round of financing .
bavaria and another german state , saxony , along with the federal government , had combined late last month to pledge loan guarantees of up to 50 million euros to help keep quelle afloat , in hopes that this would help attract private capital .
the move by the government to step in and help quelle was not popular with everyone .
competitors in the mail-order sector cried foul , and some in the public wondered why quelle received state funds when other crippled retailers did not .
quelle 's corporate sister , department store karstadt , for example , faces closure as the parent company arcandor tries to fight off insolvency. mrh / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de g8 summit -pipe- 10.07.2009 g-8 agrees on $ 20 billion food security package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 has joined forces with the g-5 and african countries to tackle hunger the g-8 has agreed a $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.3 billion euros -rrb- aid and security package to fight global hunger and promote more productive farming in the world 's poorest countries . the package , largely funded by the united states and japan , was approved by the group of eight -lrb- g-8 -rrb- leading developed economies , the group of five -lrb- g-5 -rrb- top developing states , and african leaders on the third and last day of a summit in the italian city of l 'aquila , diplomats said .
the final figure was $ 5 billion more than touted earlier in the day .
" working with the g-8 , african and european countries and multinational bodies , we had the satisfaction of increasing the $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion over three years , " said italian president silvio berlsuconi .
aid agencies are warning that the global economic crisis has pushed 100 million people in developing states back into poverty and raised the risk of famine and food riots around the world .
" we need to show the world that we will take action to avert what is a famine and hunger emergency , " said british prime minister gordon brown , who is supporting the initiative .
in the past , rich nations have responded to such crises by sending billions of dollars ' worth of food from their national surpluses to feed the starving .
at a summit in gleneagles in 2005 , g-8 leaders pledged $ 22 billion in aid to africa by 2010 .
so far , however , only a third of this pledge has been delivered .
a shift in focus to productive farming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g-8 wants to avert crises by promoting farming now , with their budgets deep in the red from spending trillions of dollars to stave off financial meltdown , g-8 states are shifting the focus onto making farms and farmers in poor countries more productive , so that famines do not happen in the first place .
funding could be used , for example , to buy seeds , build irrigation systems and teach farmers more efficient techniques .
however , un officials say that despite the shift in focus from food donations to agricultural investment , pledges made at the summit will not meet needs .
" what is new and is encouraging is that there is a decision for the first time to shift policy , " jacques diouf , director-general of the united nations ' food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- , told reuters .
" food aid is necessary because we have people suffering from drought , from flood , from conflicts and what they want is immediate food to eat ...
but if we have to feed one billion hungry people , we have to help them produce their own food , " he said .
aid agencies welcome funds but say more is needed " twenty billion dollars was a last-minute agreement and it was greeted with great happiness by all of us in the conference room , " said staffan de mistura , vice executive director of the world food program . " while we are rebuilding agriculture we need to continue supporting food assistance because the financial crisis is pushing another 103 million people into hunger this year . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diouf -lrb- l . -rrb- applauded the package but called for more the fao 's diouf applauded the g-8 plan , but warned that the situation was so grave that this amount still fell short of what was needed .
" certainly , it 's not enough .
but compared to where we were , it 's certainly a big jump , " he said . " the most important thing is the shift in policy and focus on the need to help hungry and poor people to produce their own food .
that 's the biggest shift in strategy i have seen over the past two decades . " we still have a lot of work to do , but this time i believe we will deliver , because this was the initiative of president barack obama , so yes we can , " diouf said . sarah gilliam from the non-governmental organization actionaid agreed : " the final pledge does n't change much .
it is a welcome step in the right direction to get food on the table for the one billion hungry but it 's not enough to feed them all . " aid for food must reach at least $ 23 billion a year by 2020 to reach the millennium development goal of halving hunger by 2050 , " she said . " this takes the g-8 much closer but there is still a way to go .
also , is this all additional money ?
given the g-8 record on delivery , this is still very much a work in progress . " food crisis gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un says the g-8 should do more than just give food according to the un , the number of malnourished people has risen over the past two years and is expected to top 1.02 billion this year , reversing a four-decade trend of decline .
" i think the g-8 should help reverse the trend .
how far they go toward achieving the goal , that 's the question , " diouf said .
diouf also criticized reductions in aid for agriculture , which he said fell from 17 percent in 1980 to around five percent today .
" you do n't develop a sector by cutting resources to that sector .
we therefore should reverse this negative trend in resources to agriculture and go back , " he said .
" the tragic events of the last three years , with riots in 22 countries in all regions of the world , restrictive and protectionist measures on the supply side , clearly demonstrated how fragile our international food system is and how vulnerable it is , " he added. nda / ap / afp / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu takes legal action against germany over farm subsidies the european commission has officially opened legal proceedings against germany over the southern state of bavaria 's failure to publish data on the recipients of eu agricultural subsidies .
-lrb- 25.06.2009 -rrb- germany discloses data on farm subsidies to avoid eu penalty germany has become the last eu country to disclose the beneficiaries of the bloc 's generous farm subsidies .
but the state of bavaria is still resisting financial transparency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 10.07.2009 german cabaret popolski tackles polish stereotypes with humor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popolski brothers claim their polish family invented pop music germany and poland do n't have the smoothest neighborly history .
but a german cabaret group is sparking interest in the country and winning polish fans with a program that includes lots of vodka , music and exaggeration . few people know that all of the top music hits from the last several decades were actually written by the completely unknown popolski family , who lives in poland in near poverty and never managed to attain fame due to a cunning used car salesman who craftily relieved the family of crucial financial documents . at least that 's the story that audiences at the popolski rock ' n ' roll show hear .
but the tongue-in-cheek cabaret act goes even further , asserting that poles not only invented pop music - thanks to grandpa popolski - but also made significant contributions to the fields of film , sports , and science . exaggeration is key to comedy " we 're really not trying to lampoon the poles , " said achim hagemann - aka pawel popolski , the eldest of the brothers and main character in the show .
" if it had been our intention to make fun of the poles , we would n't have come up with a family that invented pop music , but probably one that owned a car painting workshop . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of course , vodka plays a central role in the polish satire the popolski show does n't harvest laughs by digging up old worn-out stereotypes .
instead , it flips the clichés around : for once the poles are robbed instead of being permanently suspected of theft . comedy , however , lives from exaggeration , emphasized hagemann . " of course , we mess with the poles a little bit because we exaggerate certain things , " admitted the cabaret artist , " like the clothes , which no one wears any more in poland ; we brought them back from the 70s . " audience free to dance , clap and drink vodka around 20 percent of the theater group 's audience is from poland , estimated hagemann , with many of the faithful fans traveling a long way to the shows in germany . and those who have sat for hours in the train or bus might just appreciate that the show 's audience does n't sit in chairs . " we 've performed for a sitting audience before , but lots of people want to move around or dance and clap - and that 's a lot easier when they 're standing , " explained hagemann . in a cabaret show that plays around with polish cliches , it 's not surprising that vodka is one of the first to come up .
trays of small plastic shot glasses are passed around among the audience as pawel popolski demonstrates how it 's done : toast loudly , count to four , raise your glass and down it all in one gulp . then the best part : everyone disposes of the empty cup by throwing it over their shoulder , inevitably hitting the audience member standing right behind them .
but as the strong beverage and the first few minutes of comedy have loosened the atmosphere , no one is likely to complain . " everyone feels like going to poland " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : achim hagemann has a background in music , comedy and television achim hagemann , tall , blond and wiry , has a diverse entertainment background .
he studied classical music in dusseldorf before working in television for many years , including doing comedy sketches on the show " total normal . "
later , he dedicated himself to composing film music . " at some point i had the feeling that i wanted to return to the stage , " said hagemann - and the popolski show project was born seven years ago . " we heard that poles do n't understand the show , " said sylwia zbijczyk , who recently traveled with 11 other women from poland to a show in germany 's marienthal .
all of them came dressed in polish national colors , red and white . zbijczyk , however , liked the show : " it definitely wo n't be our last time here , " she said . " what these brothers do is really cool , " said german audience member ludgar haas .
" we know they 're not polish , but what they do is n't in any way detrimental to the polish people .

" the legal situation is clear .
germany is obliged to publish the details of beneficiaries of the common agricultural policy for the whole country .
every other member state has done so , " fischer-boel said .
" this is taxpayers ' money , so it is very important that people know where it is being spent , " she added .
" transparency should also improve the management of these funds by reinforcing public control of how the money is used . "
germany had dragged its feet in respecting an eu regulation requiring all 27 member states to detail the beneficiaries of generous european farm subsidies by late april , doing so only in mid-june .
but bavaria refused to publish the data , prompting the eu to say it would take germany to court , while german farmers made it clear they would resist pressure from brussels for the data to be released , challenging the regulation in national courts on the grounds that it violates their privacy .
hans-michael goldmann , the free market liberal fdp party 's agriculture expert , welcomed the move by bavaria , calling it " an intelligent decision " which would keep the german taxpayer from having to pick up the bill for any european fine .
the disclosure of the payments is " an important condition in the securing of european funds , " goldmann added .
agricultural subsidies are the largest item on the eu 's budget , and other countries have objected to them in world trade talks .
germany receives approximately six billion euros -lrb- $ 8.3 billion -rrb- in farm subsidies from the european union every year .
the data already published shows that food companies receive the highest subsidies in germany .
most money goes to sugar producers , dairies , sweet goods manufacturers and meat processing plants .
the highest subsidies in agriculture go to large agrarian enterprises in eastern germany. nda / ap / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 69,000 people will be invited to take part in a postal ballot to pick anthony steen 's successor .
tory leader david cameron said : " this is the first time any political party in britain has sought the views of the voters in such a direct way . "
mr steen has said he would stand down following reports about his expenses .
the daily telegraph reported that he claimed more than £ 87,000 over four years for his country home .
' unique chance ' local party members in totnes have already drawn up a shortlist of 11 would-be candidates to contest the next election .
this will be further reduced to a list of two to four hopefuls , who will then seek the support of the entire constituency 's electorate .
all voters in the constituency will receive a ballot paper and a freepost envelope to return it in .
mr cameron said the exercise was an " exciting opportunity " to engage with the electorate .
he added : " i hope people will take part in this unique chance to have a real say over how politics works and who represents them . "
the conservative leader has previously spoken in favour of open primaries - based on the system used in some us states for selecting party candidates .
other supporters of the process include tory backbencher douglas carswell and labour former minister frank field .
foreign secretary david miliband has also spoken favourably about the system .
in 2007 , london mayor boris johnson was chosen as conservative candidate in a contest which was open to all londoners on the electoral roll who registered on a telephone hotline .

the figures are much higher than in previous estimates because the threat from surface water flooding is included for the first time .
the report suggested 600,000 people in wales live or work in flood risk areas .
it also outlined the work needed to " manage risk " , including building new flood defences in areas of high risk .
geraint davies , chair of flood risk management wales , said : " climate change means that the number of us at risk from flooding in wales has risen to one in five or 600,000 people . "
here in wales there are important decisions for us to take about how to manage these risks ... "
chris mills , environment agency wales " this means we must redouble our efforts to adapt wales to climate change by spreading awareness , providing defences and preventing inappropriate development .
" we must act within an overview of all types of flooding - river , coastal and surface flooding - working alongside local authorities to make best use of public money to manage the growing risk to welsh communities . "
last year , environment agency wales estimated the number of properties in wales at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea at 170,000 .
that figure is now put at 222,000 .
the agency said rising sea levels and increasingly severe and frequent rain storms caused by climate change meant the risk of flooding would increase even further .
the cost of damage annually to homes and businesses in wales is estimated at around £ 200m .
' inappropriate development ' chris mills , environment agency wales director , said : " the latest uk climate change data shows that the risk of flooding will continue to increase in future due to rising sea levels and more frequent and heavy storms .
" here in wales , there are important decisions for us to take about how to manage these risks to protect people , communities , businesses and the welsh economy in future . "
the agency 's report outlined the work already done to prepare for flooding but also highlighted further work required .
this included helping people to be better prepared and preventing " inappropriate development " in flood plains .
the agency said it would be investing more than £ 16m on its capital programme this year , much of it on building new defences .
" over the last five years we have completed a number of flood improvement works which has reduced the risk of flooding to nearly 6,000 extra properties across wales as well as protecting key infrastructure , " said mr mills .
sea levels " whilst continued investment in managing these risks is crucial , we can not always prevent flooding so communities need to take responsibility for being prepared , for example by signing up to our free flood warning service . "
recent climate change forecasts from the met office suggested wales could face an increased risk of flooding as sea levels rose .
environment minister jane davidson said action was needed to limit the potential damage of climate change in the future .

advertisement a new report by the environmental agency wales has placed one in six properties at risk of flooding one in six properties in wales is at risk of flooding , according to the most detailed assessment yet drawn up by environment agency wales .
the figures are much higher than in previous estimates because the threat from surface water flooding is included for the first time .
the report suggested 600,000 people in wales live or work in flood risk areas .
it also outlined the work needed to " manage risk " , including building new flood defences in areas of high risk .
geraint davies , chair of flood risk management wales , said : " climate change means that the number of us at risk from flooding in wales has risen to one in five or 600,000 people .
here in wales there are important decisions for us to take about how to manage these risks ...
chris mills , environment agency wales " this means we must redouble our efforts to adapt wales to climate change by spreading awareness , providing defences and preventing inappropriate development .
" we must act within an overview of all types of flooding - river , coastal and surface flooding - working alongside local authorities to make best use of public money to manage the growing risk to welsh communities . "
last year , environment agency wales estimated the number of properties in wales at risk of flooding from rivers and the sea at 170,000 .
that figure is now put at 222,000 .
the agency said rising sea levels and increasingly severe and frequent rain storms caused by climate change meant the risk of flooding would increase even further .
the cost of damage annually to homes and businesses in wales is estimated at around £ 200m .
' inappropriate development ' chris mills , environment agency wales director , said : " the latest uk climate change data shows that the risk of flooding will continue to increase in future due to rising sea levels and more frequent and heavy storms .
" here in wales , there are important decisions for us to take about how to manage these risks to protect people , communities , businesses and the welsh economy in future . "
the agency 's report outlined the work already done to prepare for flooding but also highlighted further work required .
this included helping people to be better prepared and preventing " inappropriate development " in flood plains .
the agency said it would be investing more than £ 16m on its capital programme this year , much of it on building new defences .
" over the last five years we have completed a number of flood improvement works which has reduced the risk of flooding to nearly 6,000 extra properties across wales as well as protecting key infrastructure , " said mr mills .
sea levels " whilst continued investment in managing these risks is crucial , we can not always prevent flooding so communities need to take responsibility for being prepared , for example by signing up to our free flood warning service . "
recent climate change forecasts from the met office suggested wales could face an increased risk of flooding as sea levels rose .
environment minister jane davidson said action was needed to limit the potential damage of climate change in the future .
