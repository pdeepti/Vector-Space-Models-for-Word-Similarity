it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .

at the " international media dialogue " in hamburg on monday , leading publishing houses and the trade unions of the music , advertising and film industry warned about the economically devastating consequences of the " ongoing theft of intellectual property " on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers have been hit hard as the internet gains popularity the slogan of the one-day media congress was : " no future for paid content ?
media industry under pressure , " and it was all about the internet and the future of print media .
in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
that permanently threatens the creation of quality works and independent journalism , " they warned .
staying solvent speaking at hamburg 's city hall , mathias doepfner , chairman of axel-springer ag , one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in europe , suggested that more that 500 media representatives both in and outside of the country depend on intellectual property rights to stay solvent .
" we do n't want any -lrb- state -rrb- subsidies , so we need support to protect our intellectual property , " doepfner added , saying that the print media and diversity of print media would only be able exist in the digital world for as long as they can protect their investments and are able to refinance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathias doepfner says strengthening copyright laws will ensure media companies wo n't need state aid " our goal has to be keeping the main avenues of the internet free of piracy - for music , films , books , journalism and all other protected goods . "
dagmar woehrl , under secretary at the economics ministry told the german website taggesschau.de that any further developments in the protection of copyrights needs to take place on an international , and not just national , level .
it 's still being debated whether copyrights should be strengthened or if audios , videos and texts should just be opened up to free redesign on the internet .
the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .

usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .

i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .

policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

center-right parties from france , italy and germany have emerged as the strongest grouping in the european union parliamentary elections , at the expense of the socialists who suffered heavy losses . a record low voter turnout - 43.4 percent - in voting that ended sunday pointed to enduring voter apathy about the european union .

arcandor , which owns the karstadt chain and a majority share of the thomas cook travel agency , had applied for state guarantees to help refinance loans by the end of the week .
despite the government ’ s announcement , the ailing retailer still has a chance of gaining approval for its application for a 437 million euro emergency aid package from the state-owned development bank , kfw .
arcandor spokesman , gerd koslowksi said they would “ wait for the decision ” before taking any further steps .
however , should this bid also fail , koslowski warned that the group would have to file for insolvency . finance minister peer steinbrueck also told public broadcaster ard on monday that " a bankruptcy is not totally excluded . "
merger talks bildunterschrift : arcandor demonstrators in dresden berlin and the eu said that arcandor does not fulfill important criteria for receiving state aid from a fund set up to help firms out of the country ’ s current economic slump .
companies applying for support must prove among other things that their predicament was precipated by the financial crisis .
however , in the case of arcandor analysts say it was already in trouble before the crisis unfolded .
german economics minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called for progress in merger talks between arcandor and its rival , metro group , which owns the kaufhof chain .
speaking in munich , guttenberg said not enough headway had been made over the weekend .
he said arcandor should be given a “ fair chance , ” but added that any emergency aid was attacked to clear conditions . he called for the company to “ continue with clear talks . ”
indeed , negotiations between the two parties broke down on sunday .
arcandor says they are now back on track , but spokesman koslowski said it takes time to talk through the details of a complex retail merger .
“ it ca n't just be done and dusted on a sunday afternoon , ” he said .
arcandor employees carrying placards with the slogans “ i am here to defend my job ” or “ 56,000 jobs are at stake " demonstrated across germany on monday .
arcandor shares nosedived in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange on monday , losing a third of their value . tkw / nk / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.06.2009 conservatives sweep european elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe leans to the right with voters in many countries favoring conservative parties against a backdrop of an economic crisis .
center-right parties from france , italy and germany have emerged as the strongest grouping in the european union parliamentary elections , at the expense of the socialists who suffered heavy losses . a record low voter turnout - 43.4 percent - in voting that ended sunday pointed to enduring voter apathy about the european union .
but europe 's conservatives held their own , with the european people 's party securing 267 seats in the 736-member strasbourg-based european parliament .
the socialists secured 159 seats with 81 seats for the liberal democrats , who came third in the polls , followed by the greens with 51 seats . center-right parties in the largest eu member states registered large gains in france , italy , spain and poland as well as in belgium , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , bulgaria and cyprus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president nicolas sarkozy accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy at a polling booth in paris eu parliament presidennt hans-gert pöttering said the pro-european forces had stood their ground : " i expect all parties , who do not share this pro-european attitude , to work together in parliament in a productive manner , " the german conservative politician said .
some 388 million were eligible to vote for in elections for the european union 's only directly elected institution .
" i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
after four days of elections across the 27-member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi wins despite scandal over allegations he had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old model socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists , said .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us . "
addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ barroso said .
far-right gains in the uk pressure on british prime minister gordon brown intensified sunday with a crushing defeat for his ruling labour party in european elections , which brought successes for anti-european and anti-immigration extremist parties .
the far-right british national party , which campaigns for a halt to immigration , won its first two seats to the european parliament .
mainstream parties lamented the breakthrough made by a party they regard as racist .
" it 's a sad moment for british politics , " health secretary andy burnham said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister gordon brown faces renewed calls for his resignation after his party 's dismal election result provisional results gave the labour party 14 percent of the vote , compared with 22 per cent in the last european poll in 2004 .
analysts said the result was the worst for labour in a nationwide poll since 1918 .
the ruling party was overtaken by ukip , the anti-european ukindependence party , which scored around 17 percent of the vote .
the conservatives led by david cameron improved their share of the vote to 29 per cent , while the liberal democrats , gained 14 per cent .
the full results for scotland and northern ireland will be announced later on monday .
there were also big gains for right-wing and euro-sceptic parties , especially in south-eastern europe , but also in the netherlands , austria and denmark. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .

at the " international media dialogue " in hamburg on monday , leading publishing houses and the trade unions of the music , advertising and film industry warned about the economically devastating consequences of the " ongoing theft of intellectual property " on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers have been hit hard as the internet gains popularity the slogan of the one-day media congress was : " no future for paid content ?
media industry under pressure , " and it was all about the internet and the future of print media .
in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
that permanently threatens the creation of quality works and independent journalism , " they warned .
staying solvent speaking at hamburg 's city hall , mathias doepfner , chairman of axel-springer ag , one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in europe , suggested that more that 500 media representatives both in and outside of the country depend on intellectual property rights to stay solvent .
" we do n't want any -lrb- state -rrb- subsidies , so we need support to protect our intellectual property , " doepfner added , saying that the print media and diversity of print media would only be able exist in the digital world for as long as they can protect their investments and are able to refinance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathias doepfner says strengthening copyright laws will ensure media companies wo n't need state aid " our goal has to be keeping the main avenues of the internet free of piracy - for music , films , books , journalism and all other protected goods . "
dagmar woehrl , under secretary at the economics ministry told the german website taggesschau.de that any further developments in the protection of copyrights needs to take place on an international , and not just national , level .
it 's still being debated whether copyrights should be strengthened or if audios , videos and texts should just be opened up to free redesign on the internet .
the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hard-line socialist party the left improved its score to 7.5 percent from 6.1 percent .

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the company 's shares were in free fall on monday as merger talks with rival metro continued . the economics ministry in berlin said a government committee on monday denied arcandor 's bid to receive loan guarantees worth 650 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- to avoid bankruptcy .
arcandor , which owns the karstadt chain and a majority share of the thomas cook travel agency , had applied for state guarantees to help refinance loans by the end of the week .
despite the government ’ s announcement , the ailing retailer still has a chance of gaining approval for its application for a 437 million euro emergency aid package from the state-owned development bank , kfw .
arcandor spokesman , gerd koslowksi said they would “ wait for the decision ” before taking any further steps .
however , should this bid also fail , koslowski warned that the group would have to file for insolvency . finance minister peer steinbrueck also told public broadcaster ard on monday that " a bankruptcy is not totally excluded . "
merger talks bildunterschrift : arcandor demonstrators in dresden berlin and the eu said that arcandor does not fulfill important criteria for receiving state aid from a fund set up to help firms out of the country ’ s current economic slump .
companies applying for support must prove among other things that their predicament was precipated by the financial crisis .
however , in the case of arcandor analysts say it was already in trouble before the crisis unfolded .
german economics minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called for progress in merger talks between arcandor and its rival , metro group , which owns the kaufhof chain .
speaking in munich , guttenberg said not enough headway had been made over the weekend .
he said arcandor should be given a “ fair chance , ” but added that any emergency aid was attacked to clear conditions . he called for the company to “ continue with clear talks . ”
indeed , negotiations between the two parties broke down on sunday .
arcandor says they are now back on track , but spokesman koslowski said it takes time to talk through the details of a complex retail merger .
“ it ca n't just be done and dusted on a sunday afternoon , ” he said .
arcandor employees carrying placards with the slogans “ i am here to defend my job ” or “ 56,000 jobs are at stake " demonstrated across germany on monday .

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .
some 192 nations are taking part in the bonn talks , which are proving difficult because national interests and the competitiveness of various industrial sectors are at stake . " what is sometimes forgotten is that a large part of this process is about how 145 very poor countries are going to adapt to the impact of climate change and be helped to grow their economies in a cleaner way , " de boer said . the european union has offered a cut by 2020 of 20 percent compared to its emissions in 1990 .
the united states has proposed a cut of 17 percent compared to its emissions in 2005 , which translates to about four percent in comparison with 1990 . what 's at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts have said time is running out for the environment scientists have urged diplomats to adopt policies that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by the end of this century , saying any more might prove disastrous for life on earth . more than 20 million people have been displaced by climate-related sudden-onset natural disasters in 2008 alone , according to a new study by the norwegian refugee council 's internal displacement monitoring center and the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . at the start of the bonn talks , de boer said he was confident that the copenhagen meeting would succeed , although " there are some tough nuts to crack . "
parties to the talks will have at least three more chances to make their positions known ahead of the meeting in the danish capital .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .

" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .

most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "

center-right parties from france , italy and germany have emerged as the strongest grouping in the european union parliamentary elections , at the expense of the socialists who suffered heavy losses . a record low voter turnout - 43.4 percent - in voting that ended sunday pointed to enduring voter apathy about the european union .
but europe 's conservatives held their own , with the european people 's party securing 267 seats in the 736-member strasbourg-based european parliament .
the socialists secured 159 seats with 81 seats for the liberal democrats , who came third in the polls , followed by the greens with 51 seats . center-right parties in the largest eu member states registered large gains in france , italy , spain and poland as well as in belgium , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , bulgaria and cyprus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president nicolas sarkozy accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy at a polling booth in paris eu parliament presidennt hans-gert pöttering said the pro-european forces had stood their ground : " i expect all parties , who do not share this pro-european attitude , to work together in parliament in a productive manner , " the german conservative politician said .
some 388 million were eligible to vote for in elections for the european union 's only directly elected institution .
" i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
after four days of elections across the 27-member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi wins despite scandal over allegations he had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old model socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists , said .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us . "
addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ barroso said .
far-right gains in the uk pressure on british prime minister gordon brown intensified sunday with a crushing defeat for his ruling labour party in european elections , which brought successes for anti-european and anti-immigration extremist parties .
the far-right british national party , which campaigns for a halt to immigration , won its first two seats to the european parliament .
mainstream parties lamented the breakthrough made by a party they regard as racist .
" it 's a sad moment for british politics , " health secretary andy burnham said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister gordon brown faces renewed calls for his resignation after his party 's dismal election result provisional results gave the labour party 14 percent of the vote , compared with 22 per cent in the last european poll in 2004 .
analysts said the result was the worst for labour in a nationwide poll since 1918 .
the ruling party was overtaken by ukip , the anti-european ukindependence party , which scored around 17 percent of the vote .
the conservatives led by david cameron improved their share of the vote to 29 per cent , while the liberal democrats , gained 14 per cent .
the full results for scotland and northern ireland will be announced later on monday .
there were also big gains for right-wing and euro-sceptic parties , especially in south-eastern europe , but also in the netherlands , austria and denmark. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.06.2009 vietnamese immigrants face deportation from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany are involved in cigarette smuggling tricked by smugglers , hundreds of vietnamese give up everything to come to germany , only to be denied asylum .
now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .

in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .

the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .

in a referendum held on sunday , 85.4 percent of voters said ‘ yes ' to a proposal to change a provision in the country 's constitution that made the monarch 's first-born son heir to the throne even if he had an older sister . only 14.6 percent voted against it .
prime minister lars lokke rasmussen reacted positively to the change , saying “ it was important for gender equality . ” under the constitutional amendment , which had already been approved by lawmakers last year , the first-born child of any future monarch is to inherit the throne , regardless of gender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik with his first-born child and heir to the throne , prince christian the amendment was first proposed in 2005 when crown prince frederik and princess mary were expecting their first child .
however , the public debate died down after she gave birth to a son , prince christian .
they later had a daughter , isabella .
this marks a dramatic shift for women in the over 1,000-year-old danish monarchy .
queen margrethe was able to inherit the throne in 1972 , but only because she did n't have any brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish queen margrethe inherited the throne in 1972 prime minister rasmussen also told his liberal party supporters that the referendum was " a strong signal that shows that we want to be a society where men and women have the same opportunities , whether it is for ordinary people or princes and princesses . ”
turnout for the referendum was almost 59 percent of the four million eligible voters . vj / afp / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the company 's shares were in free fall on monday as merger talks with rival metro continued . the economics ministry in berlin said a government committee on monday denied arcandor 's bid to receive loan guarantees worth 650 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- to avoid bankruptcy .
arcandor , which owns the karstadt chain and a majority share of the thomas cook travel agency , had applied for state guarantees to help refinance loans by the end of the week .
despite the government ’ s announcement , the ailing retailer still has a chance of gaining approval for its application for a 437 million euro emergency aid package from the state-owned development bank , kfw .
arcandor spokesman , gerd koslowksi said they would “ wait for the decision ” before taking any further steps .
however , should this bid also fail , koslowski warned that the group would have to file for insolvency . finance minister peer steinbrueck also told public broadcaster ard on monday that " a bankruptcy is not totally excluded . "

german economics minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called for progress in merger talks between arcandor and its rival , metro group , which owns the kaufhof chain .

he said arcandor should be given a “ fair chance , ” but added that any emergency aid was attacked to clear conditions . he called for the company to “ continue with clear talks . ”
indeed , negotiations between the two parties broke down on sunday .
arcandor says they are now back on track , but spokesman koslowski said it takes time to talk through the details of a complex retail merger .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "
double no hours earlier , the group 's fight for survival had taken a major blow when berlin rejected its bid for 650 million euros in loan guarantees , as had been widely expected .
the company has major debts due on friday june 12 , and says that it can not foot the bill without help .
the company has over 50,000 employees in germany , and has backing from major trade unions in its fight for survival .

" but it 's no good pumping money in to keep the company afloat for a few more weeks , only later to admit that it did n't really make any sense . "
if no help arrives by the end of the week , arcandor may file for insolvency , wiping out all of the value for its shareholders and allowing a court-appointed administrator to take over , spin off the profitable thomas cook travel company and the quelle mail-order business and shrink the stores chain . complex talks german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has called on arcandor to redouble efforts in negotiations with metro .
speaking to reporters in munich , he said that berlin wanted to give arcandor " a fair chance " , but added that it had set clear conditions for offering a bridge loan .
" i can only call for the talks to be continued with suitable transparency and clarity , " zu guttenberg said , adding that a meeting between the two parties on sunday had broken down and yielded very few " hard facts . "
but negotiations between germany 's two high street giants are too complex to be completed in a hurry , arcandor spokesman koslowski said .
" this can not be sorted out on a sunday afternoon , " he said .
bildunterschrift : arcandor staff have been protesting all over the country over 1,000 employees protested in front of arcandor 's head office in essen on monday , calling for the government to rescue the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .

currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .

" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

the spd , junior partners in merkel 's uneasy grand coalition , had expected to improve on 2004 's 21.5 percent . despite the negative trend , cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said his party was satisfied with the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp was the biggest winner - party leader guido westerwelle with colleague silvana koch-mehrin " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september .
we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " eu polls seen as a test for german national elections the social democrats ' poor showing is expected to trigger some searching questions ahead of september 's general election , in which both cdu and spd have hoped to seek new alternatives to their current uneasy grand coalition . " it is a disappointing result ; there is no other way of putting it , " german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel , said . the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partners after september , were the biggest winner of sunday 's vote , with their score soaring to 10.6 percent from 6.1 percent . the greens were the third strongest party with 11.6 percent of the vote , compared to 11.9 percent in 2004 .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .

the socialists secured 159 seats with 81 seats for the liberal democrats , who came third in the polls , followed by the greens with 51 seats . center-right parties in the largest eu member states registered large gains in france , italy , spain and poland as well as in belgium , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , bulgaria and cyprus .

some 388 million were eligible to vote for in elections for the european union 's only directly elected institution .
" i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
after four days of elections across the 27-member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .

“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us . "

arcandor , which owns the karstadt chain and a majority share of the thomas cook travel agency , had applied for state guarantees to help refinance loans by the end of the week .

arcandor says they are now back on track , but spokesman koslowski said it takes time to talk through the details of a complex retail merger .
“ it ca n't just be done and dusted on a sunday afternoon , ” he said .
arcandor employees carrying placards with the slogans “ i am here to defend my job ” or “ 56,000 jobs are at stake " demonstrated across germany on monday .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .

dagmar woehrl , under secretary at the economics ministry told the german website taggesschau.de that any further developments in the protection of copyrights needs to take place on an international , and not just national , level .
it 's still being debated whether copyrights should be strengthened or if audios , videos and texts should just be opened up to free redesign on the internet .
the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
that permanently threatens the creation of quality works and independent journalism , " they warned .
staying solvent speaking at hamburg 's city hall , mathias doepfner , chairman of axel-springer ag , one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in europe , suggested that more that 500 media representatives both in and outside of the country depend on intellectual property rights to stay solvent .

however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .

" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .

refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .

the company 's shares were in free fall on monday as merger talks with rival metro continued . the economics ministry in berlin said a government committee on monday denied arcandor 's bid to receive loan guarantees worth 650 million euros -lrb- $ 900 million -rrb- to avoid bankruptcy .
arcandor , which owns the karstadt chain and a majority share of the thomas cook travel agency , had applied for state guarantees to help refinance loans by the end of the week .
despite the government ’ s announcement , the ailing retailer still has a chance of gaining approval for its application for a 437 million euro emergency aid package from the state-owned development bank , kfw .
arcandor spokesman , gerd koslowksi said they would “ wait for the decision ” before taking any further steps .
however , should this bid also fail , koslowski warned that the group would have to file for insolvency . finance minister peer steinbrueck also told public broadcaster ard on monday that " a bankruptcy is not totally excluded . "
merger talks bildunterschrift : arcandor demonstrators in dresden berlin and the eu said that arcandor does not fulfill important criteria for receiving state aid from a fund set up to help firms out of the country ’ s current economic slump .
companies applying for support must prove among other things that their predicament was precipated by the financial crisis .
however , in the case of arcandor analysts say it was already in trouble before the crisis unfolded .
german economics minister , karl-theodor zu guttenberg has called for progress in merger talks between arcandor and its rival , metro group , which owns the kaufhof chain .
speaking in munich , guttenberg said not enough headway had been made over the weekend .
he said arcandor should be given a “ fair chance , ” but added that any emergency aid was attacked to clear conditions . he called for the company to “ continue with clear talks . ”
indeed , negotiations between the two parties broke down on sunday .
arcandor says they are now back on track , but spokesman koslowski said it takes time to talk through the details of a complex retail merger .
“ it ca n't just be done and dusted on a sunday afternoon , ” he said .
arcandor employees carrying placards with the slogans “ i am here to defend my job ” or “ 56,000 jobs are at stake " demonstrated across germany on monday .
arcandor shares nosedived in early trading on the frankfurt stock exchange on monday , losing a third of their value . tkw / nk / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a referendum held on sunday , 85.4 percent of voters said ‘ yes ' to a proposal to change a provision in the country 's constitution that made the monarch 's first-born son heir to the throne even if he had an older sister . only 14.6 percent voted against it .
prime minister lars lokke rasmussen reacted positively to the change , saying “ it was important for gender equality . ” under the constitutional amendment , which had already been approved by lawmakers last year , the first-born child of any future monarch is to inherit the throne , regardless of gender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik with his first-born child and heir to the throne , prince christian the amendment was first proposed in 2005 when crown prince frederik and princess mary were expecting their first child .
however , the public debate died down after she gave birth to a son , prince christian .
they later had a daughter , isabella .
this marks a dramatic shift for women in the over 1,000-year-old danish monarchy .
queen margrethe was able to inherit the throne in 1972 , but only because she did n't have any brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish queen margrethe inherited the throne in 1972 prime minister rasmussen also told his liberal party supporters that the referendum was " a strong signal that shows that we want to be a society where men and women have the same opportunities , whether it is for ordinary people or princes and princesses . ”
turnout for the referendum was almost 59 percent of the four million eligible voters . vj / afp / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .

after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a referendum held on sunday , 85.4 percent of voters said ‘ yes ' to a proposal to change a provision in the country 's constitution that made the monarch 's first-born son heir to the throne even if he had an older sister . only 14.6 percent voted against it .
prime minister lars lokke rasmussen reacted positively to the change , saying “ it was important for gender equality . ” under the constitutional amendment , which had already been approved by lawmakers last year , the first-born child of any future monarch is to inherit the throne , regardless of gender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik with his first-born child and heir to the throne , prince christian the amendment was first proposed in 2005 when crown prince frederik and princess mary were expecting their first child .
however , the public debate died down after she gave birth to a son , prince christian .
they later had a daughter , isabella .
this marks a dramatic shift for women in the over 1,000-year-old danish monarchy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish queen margrethe inherited the throne in 1972 prime minister rasmussen also told his liberal party supporters that the referendum was " a strong signal that shows that we want to be a society where men and women have the same opportunities , whether it is for ordinary people or princes and princesses . ”

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

in a referendum held on sunday , 85.4 percent of voters said ‘ yes ' to a proposal to change a provision in the country 's constitution that made the monarch 's first-born son heir to the throne even if he had an older sister . only 14.6 percent voted against it .
prime minister lars lokke rasmussen reacted positively to the change , saying “ it was important for gender equality . ” under the constitutional amendment , which had already been approved by lawmakers last year , the first-born child of any future monarch is to inherit the throne , regardless of gender .

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 08.06.2009 blocking access to child porn does n't help victims , expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condemnation of child porn is universal , but not everyone agrees on how to fight it germany was right to drop plans that would have blocked access to web sites containing child pornography , an expert told dw .
such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "
double no hours earlier , the group 's fight for survival had taken a major blow when berlin rejected its bid for 650 million euros in loan guarantees , as had been widely expected .
the company has major debts due on friday june 12 , and says that it can not foot the bill without help .
the company has over 50,000 employees in germany , and has backing from major trade unions in its fight for survival .

" but it 's no good pumping money in to keep the company afloat for a few more weeks , only later to admit that it did n't really make any sense . "
if no help arrives by the end of the week , arcandor may file for insolvency , wiping out all of the value for its shareholders and allowing a court-appointed administrator to take over , spin off the profitable thomas cook travel company and the quelle mail-order business and shrink the stores chain . complex talks german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has called on arcandor to redouble efforts in negotiations with metro .
speaking to reporters in munich , he said that berlin wanted to give arcandor " a fair chance " , but added that it had set clear conditions for offering a bridge loan .
" i can only call for the talks to be continued with suitable transparency and clarity , " zu guttenberg said , adding that a meeting between the two parties on sunday had broken down and yielded very few " hard facts . "
but negotiations between germany 's two high street giants are too complex to be completed in a hurry , arcandor spokesman koslowski said .
" this can not be sorted out on a sunday afternoon , " he said .

the spd , junior partners in merkel 's uneasy grand coalition , had expected to improve on 2004 's 21.5 percent . despite the negative trend , cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said his party was satisfied with the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp was the biggest winner - party leader guido westerwelle with colleague silvana koch-mehrin " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september .
we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " eu polls seen as a test for german national elections the social democrats ' poor showing is expected to trigger some searching questions ahead of september 's general election , in which both cdu and spd have hoped to seek new alternatives to their current uneasy grand coalition . " it is a disappointing result ; there is no other way of putting it , " german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel , said . the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partners after september , were the biggest winner of sunday 's vote , with their score soaring to 10.6 percent from 6.1 percent . the greens were the third strongest party with 11.6 percent of the vote , compared to 11.9 percent in 2004 .
the hard-line socialist party the left improved its score to 7.5 percent from 6.1 percent .
but it was n't as high as had been predicted by some analysts .
the left had hoped to benefit more from voter dissatisfaction with the government ’ s attempts to deal with the economic crisis . campaigns dominated by national , not european issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning across germany failed to bring more people to the ballot box none of the remaining smaller parties managed to gather enough votes for a ticket to the european parliament .
the eu vote is seen as a crucial test for german national elections in september . leading into sunday 's election , voter turnout had been expected to be at a record low .
eventually , 43.3 percent of eligible german voters cast their ballots , up from 43 percent in 2004 . with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament . election campaigns in germany had been dominated by national issues and the struggle against the global recession . av / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .

that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .

we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "
double no hours earlier , the group 's fight for survival had taken a major blow when berlin rejected its bid for 650 million euros in loan guarantees , as had been widely expected .
the company has major debts due on friday june 12 , and says that it can not foot the bill without help .

" but it 's no good pumping money in to keep the company afloat for a few more weeks , only later to admit that it did n't really make any sense . "
if no help arrives by the end of the week , arcandor may file for insolvency , wiping out all of the value for its shareholders and allowing a court-appointed administrator to take over , spin off the profitable thomas cook travel company and the quelle mail-order business and shrink the stores chain . complex talks german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has called on arcandor to redouble efforts in negotiations with metro .
speaking to reporters in munich , he said that berlin wanted to give arcandor " a fair chance " , but added that it had set clear conditions for offering a bridge loan .
" i can only call for the talks to be continued with suitable transparency and clarity , " zu guttenberg said , adding that a meeting between the two parties on sunday had broken down and yielded very few " hard facts . "
but negotiations between germany 's two high street giants are too complex to be completed in a hurry , arcandor spokesman koslowski said .
" this can not be sorted out on a sunday afternoon , " he said .

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "
double no hours earlier , the group 's fight for survival had taken a major blow when berlin rejected its bid for 650 million euros in loan guarantees , as had been widely expected .
the company has major debts due on friday june 12 , and says that it can not foot the bill without help .
the company has over 50,000 employees in germany , and has backing from major trade unions in its fight for survival .

" but it 's no good pumping money in to keep the company afloat for a few more weeks , only later to admit that it did n't really make any sense . "
if no help arrives by the end of the week , arcandor may file for insolvency , wiping out all of the value for its shareholders and allowing a court-appointed administrator to take over , spin off the profitable thomas cook travel company and the quelle mail-order business and shrink the stores chain . complex talks german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has called on arcandor to redouble efforts in negotiations with metro .
speaking to reporters in munich , he said that berlin wanted to give arcandor " a fair chance " , but added that it had set clear conditions for offering a bridge loan .
" i can only call for the talks to be continued with suitable transparency and clarity , " zu guttenberg said , adding that a meeting between the two parties on sunday had broken down and yielded very few " hard facts . "
but negotiations between germany 's two high street giants are too complex to be completed in a hurry , arcandor spokesman koslowski said .
" this can not be sorted out on a sunday afternoon , " he said .
bildunterschrift : arcandor staff have been protesting all over the country over 1,000 employees protested in front of arcandor 's head office in essen on monday , calling for the government to rescue the company .

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio .

" the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .

in a referendum held on sunday , 85.4 percent of voters said ‘ yes ' to a proposal to change a provision in the country 's constitution that made the monarch 's first-born son heir to the throne even if he had an older sister . only 14.6 percent voted against it .
prime minister lars lokke rasmussen reacted positively to the change , saying “ it was important for gender equality . ” under the constitutional amendment , which had already been approved by lawmakers last year , the first-born child of any future monarch is to inherit the throne , regardless of gender .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik with his first-born child and heir to the throne , prince christian the amendment was first proposed in 2005 when crown prince frederik and princess mary were expecting their first child .
however , the public debate died down after she gave birth to a son , prince christian .
they later had a daughter , isabella .
this marks a dramatic shift for women in the over 1,000-year-old danish monarchy .
queen margrethe was able to inherit the throne in 1972 , but only because she did n't have any brothers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish queen margrethe inherited the throne in 1972 prime minister rasmussen also told his liberal party supporters that the referendum was " a strong signal that shows that we want to be a society where men and women have the same opportunities , whether it is for ordinary people or princes and princesses . ”
turnout for the referendum was almost 59 percent of the four million eligible voters . vj / afp / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .
in the uk , the far right british national party won their first seat in the eu parliament . av / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .

" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .

however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.06.2009 vietnamese immigrants face deportation from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany are involved in cigarette smuggling tricked by smugglers , hundreds of vietnamese give up everything to come to germany , only to be denied asylum .
now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .
in the uk , the far right british national party won their first seat in the eu parliament . av / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.06.2009 vietnamese immigrants face deportation from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany are involved in cigarette smuggling tricked by smugglers , hundreds of vietnamese give up everything to come to germany , only to be denied asylum .
now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .
in the uk , the far right british national party won their first seat in the eu parliament . av / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .
e.on has announced plans to swap power plants with belgium 's electrabel and has also transferred stakes in plants to german utility energie baden-wuerttemberg ag. nk / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .
in the uk , the far right british national party won their first seat in the eu parliament . av / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the spd , junior partners in merkel 's uneasy grand coalition , had expected to improve on 2004 's 21.5 percent . despite the negative trend , cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said his party was satisfied with the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp was the biggest winner - party leader guido westerwelle with colleague silvana koch-mehrin " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september .
we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " eu polls seen as a test for german national elections the social democrats ' poor showing is expected to trigger some searching questions ahead of september 's general election , in which both cdu and spd have hoped to seek new alternatives to their current uneasy grand coalition . " it is a disappointing result ; there is no other way of putting it , " german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel , said . the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partners after september , were the biggest winner of sunday 's vote , with their score soaring to 10.6 percent from 6.1 percent . the greens were the third strongest party with 11.6 percent of the vote , compared to 11.9 percent in 2004 .
the hard-line socialist party the left improved its score to 7.5 percent from 6.1 percent .
but it was n't as high as had been predicted by some analysts .

eventually , 43.3 percent of eligible german voters cast their ballots , up from 43 percent in 2004 . with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament . election campaigns in germany had been dominated by national issues and the struggle against the global recession . av / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .
the internet has also been beneficial . interview sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .

such schemes do n't always work , lack transparency and seldom help victims . germany 's family ministry recently suggested creating a list of web sites that contain child pornography and blocking access to them .
but the plan was eventually dropped after civil rights - and even victims ' rights - groups opposed the proposed law . the government 's decisions to shelve the plan was the right one , according to yaman akdeniz , the director of british cyber-rights and cyber-liberties organization and an expert on the legal issues surrounding child pornography . he told deutsche welle that such technology-based blocks are not always effective and do n't help children who have been sexually abused . deutsche welle : what are some of the technology-based measure being used around the world to fight child pornography and how effective do you think they are ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blocking access to web sites never works 100 percent of the time , akdeniz said yaman akdeniz : in the last few years , because of the limitations of the legal systems - the perpetrators or criminals are not always located in the jurisdiction where child pornography is accessible - governments and policy makers started to develop policies to block access to known web sites and other forums carrying child pornography .
usually this involves blocking access completely from one country to known sources around the world .
the uk has been very active in blocking access to child pornography web sites .
lists are complied on a daily basis and the lists are fed into a system , which many internet service providers use to block access to known web sites carrying child pornography . that sounds similar to a german plan that 's been put on the shelf now .
what do you think of the german government 's decision not to block access to web sites with child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no way to block all access to sites that contain child pornography first of all , there are questions marks about the effectiveness of such a system .
i do n't know the exact details of the system in germany or why the system was dropped , however , these systems are not 100 percent effective .
there are issues of transparency - nobody knows what 's being blocked and nobody knows what the criteria are for blocking .
secondly , these systems only prevent accidental access to such web sites .
if anybody wants to deliberately access these web sites , they will somehow find the technological means to access them .
these preventives tools and technologies are never 100 percent effective in blocking access . technologists are also developing what we call circumvention technologies to bypass the blocking or censorship mechanisms .
these are used , for example , in china to fight political censorship , but they can also be used to bypass blocking mechanisms for any other types of content .
real hardcore pedophiles or anyone else who wants to access these web sites will find the means to access them . in a sense , blocking access to these web sites does not necessarily make the problem go away .
we just push it off our computer screens - whether in germany or the united kingdom or any other country - but that does n't necessarily mean the serious problem of sexual exploitation of children and child pornography disappear from the internet . is there a technological way to help the victims of child pornography ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new images of abused children are appearing on the internet from a policy development point of view , i think the emphasis of policy initiatives should be preventing sexual exploitation of children . for example , there is concern that there are more new , exploitative images coming online because most people have digital cameras or telephones .
that means real children are being abused somewhere around the globe .
policy makers and police need to concentrate on identifying these children and saving them . first the abusers then the commercial distributers need to be targeted and then policy makers need to worry about the people who download or view child pornography and prevent them from accessing or viewing child pornography .
i 'm not here to say that 's not important , but we need to prioritize and there are more important things to be done in the fight against child pornography . do you think the internet has made it easier to spread child pornography or increased access to it ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have had some success in cracking child pornography rings compared to the pre-internet age - which i 'd would say is before the mid-1990s - child pornography was predominately a cottage industry and not very visible , but , obviously , the problem of pedophilia and child pornography has not been created by the internet .
it 's the medium where its distribution is facilitated .
more child pornography is in circulation , but that does not necessarily mean there is more child pornography compared to the 1980s .
it 's the technological development of not just the internet , but cheaper access to digital cameras and mobile phones with cameras that make it easier to take photos . but when you look at the prosecution statistics , especially in the united kingdom and the united states , there were only a handful of prosecutions back in 1995 because the police in both countries were not in a position to find the criminals and they did n't come in contact with pedophiles because they were circulating their images in secrecy . now they do it on the internet , which has resulted in several successful operations , and in the uk police are now averaging over 1,000 prosecutions every year for child pornography offenses .
in the united states that number reached about 1,500 a year , and has been such since about 2001 .
a lot of people are being prosecuted for child pornography related offenses because they leave digital traces .
easy accessibility and visibility , perhaps , turned into better policing and more people are being prosecuted - as a result of which , i hope more children will be saved from these abusive environments . we ca n't just blame the internet .

on monday , the german government refused give arcandor hundreds of millions of euros in either guarantees or emergency loans , decisions that could push the group into bankruptcy .
government sources on monday evening said that berlin turned down a request for a federal loan of 437 million euros -lrb- $ 605 million -rrb- to tide arcandor over while it seeks a merger with rival retail group metro .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if shareholders do n't come through , the company could be headed towards bankruptcy arcandor 's highest-profile brand in germany , high-street department store giant karstadt , has been struggling to maintain its market share for years now , with fashion chains , discount stores and shopping malls eating into its revenue .
both the german government and the european union had already talked down the prospect of a bailout , pointing out that the firm was in trouble even before the current recession began .
earlier on monday chancellor angela merkel said it was up to shareholders to lend the ailing company money in order to save it , adding that they needed a " permanent solution , and not a stop-gap to tide them over " for the next two to six months . "
double no hours earlier , the group 's fight for survival had taken a major blow when berlin rejected its bid for 650 million euros in loan guarantees , as had been widely expected .
the company has major debts due on friday june 12 , and says that it can not foot the bill without help .
the company has over 50,000 employees in germany , and has backing from major trade unions in its fight for survival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt is currently one of the biggest names on the german high street " of course we are taking the concerns of arcandor employees seriously , " the chairman of angel merkel 's centre-right cdu / csu parliamentary group , volker kauder said .
" but it 's no good pumping money in to keep the company afloat for a few more weeks , only later to admit that it did n't really make any sense . "
if no help arrives by the end of the week , arcandor may file for insolvency , wiping out all of the value for its shareholders and allowing a court-appointed administrator to take over , spin off the profitable thomas cook travel company and the quelle mail-order business and shrink the stores chain . complex talks german economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg has called on arcandor to redouble efforts in negotiations with metro .
speaking to reporters in munich , he said that berlin wanted to give arcandor " a fair chance " , but added that it had set clear conditions for offering a bridge loan .
" i can only call for the talks to be continued with suitable transparency and clarity , " zu guttenberg said , adding that a meeting between the two parties on sunday had broken down and yielded very few " hard facts . "
but negotiations between germany 's two high street giants are too complex to be completed in a hurry , arcandor spokesman koslowski said .
" this can not be sorted out on a sunday afternoon , " he said .

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move is meant to allay eu anti-trust concerns . verbund , austria 's biggest electricity producer , announced on monday that it had agreed to buy 13 hydroelectric power stations from german rival e.on. both companies agreed not to divulge the sale price for the plants , which have a combined capacity of 312 megawatts and are situated along the river inn in the german state of bavaria .
verbund said the transaction would be sealed in the third quarter of 2009 , pending approval by the european commission - the 27-member bloc 's competition watchdog .
the deal is part of e.on 's commitment to the eu commission , made last year , to divest itself of 5,000 megawatts of generating capacity , as well as its high voltage power lines in germany .
including the sale to verbund , e.on has reportedly struck deals equivalent to shedding 3,200 megawatts .

but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 08.06.2009 eu vote buoys cdu ahead of federal polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu elections are over , german parties are looking to national elections the victory of germany 's conservatives in eu elections has led to increased speculation about the outcome of federal elections in september .
but commentators say there 's still a long way to go . german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- remained germany 's strongest party despite suffering losses in sunday 's european parliamentary elections . the conservatives ' victory dealt a crushing blow to their social democrat -lrb- spd -rrb- grand coalition partners .
support for the spd fell to record lows in sunday 's election . vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel described the defeat as " a disappointing result . " steinmeier said there was no point in beating around the bush .
" i expected a different outcome , " he said .
" moreover , i would have liked to have seen a different outcome . " speaking on germany 's ard public broadcaster on monday morning , social democrat finance minister , peer steinbrueck said he felt a " certain sense of helplessness " in light of the eu ballot .
he conceded that the spd 's election campaign strategies had not been as good as the party imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck had hoped for a better result although the spd garnered just 20.8 percent of the vote , steinbrueck said there was no need to open up a personnel debate within the party . speculating ahead germany 's conservatives were jubilant , saying sunday 's victory bolstered their bid to retain power in september 's national election . " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september , " ronald pofalla , general secretary of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- told radio station deutschlandradio . " we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " pofalla said sunday 's poll had proved chancellor angela merkel to be the " most popular and most trusted political personality in germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention will now focus on national elections the leader of the cdu parliamentary group , volker kauder told the bayrischer rundfunk radio network that the eu vote represented " a clear opportunity " to form a government with the liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partner , in september . kauder added that " elections are not won until polling stations close their doors . " the fdp was the biggest winner in sunday 's election , taking 10.9 percent of the vote - an increase of 4.8 points . the general secretary of the fdp , dirk niebel , said the only coalition possibility he could see was between merkel 's cdu and its bavaria-only sister party the csu , and his own pro-business party . not a done deal but juergen trittin of germany 's green party , which came in third on sunday night with 11.6 percent of the vote , warned the conservatives and the liberals not to get carried away too soon . " for those who are running about grinning like cheshire cats , squinting at the parliamentary elections , i have just one thing to say : the fdp did not even win as much as the cdu and csu lost between them . " an editorial in the neue osnabruecker zeitung said it was too soon to cut the spd out of the mainframe of german politics . " the chances for a conservative-fdp coalition have indeed increased , but the low voter turnout could well give the wrong idea about party popularity , " the paper said . " in september , it will be much easier for the spd to mobilize frustrated supporters to cast their ballots than in european elections which are widely considered to be unimportant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.06.2009 vietnamese immigrants face deportation from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany are involved in cigarette smuggling tricked by smugglers , hundreds of vietnamese give up everything to come to germany , only to be denied asylum .
now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 08.06.2009 vietnamese immigrants face deportation from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany are involved in cigarette smuggling tricked by smugglers , hundreds of vietnamese give up everything to come to germany , only to be denied asylum .
now , many illegal immigrants are being sent back home . for the first time , the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation of about 100 vietnamese from germany and poland on monday .
the group is to be flown out on an air berlin flight from the schoenefeld airport in the german capital .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises of smugglers , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from asian country is growing .
and , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
asylum-seekers risk everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with few legal options , some undocumented vietnamese immigrants turn to the black market in the berlin neighborhood of marzahn , the vietnamese community is divided into two groups .
there are the successful businessmen , standing behind the counters of their florist shops and fast food stands .
most of these men were formerly guest workers , who have fought for years for their modest life in germany .
when a police car cruises down their streets , they appear pleased : here come their customers .
along the edge of the parking lot , stand another group of vietnamese men - and here it is a different story .
they are selling black market cigarettes and the uniforms and flashing lights set them into a panic , as they make their perilous getaways across busy streets and subway tracks .
these illegal street vendors belong to a new generation of immigrants .
their chances for a future in germany are slim , says tamara henschel , head of reistrommel , an organization that seeks to help vietnamese immigrants in marzahn .
" after vietnam opened up , but even after the fall of the iron curtain , many vietnamese who had never been abroad came to europe , " she explained .
" in principle , it would be better for us and we would welcome it if people would stay in their home countries .
if they did n't undertake such risky journeys , which are sometimes very dangerous , put these people into debt and ruin their lives . "
most asylum applications rejected with little money and no work permit , the new immigrants often turn to illegal trade as a last resort .
refugee organizations are protesting the unusual deportation from berlin 's schoenefeld airport .
the berlin refugee council quotes a report from amnesty international that warns against returning asylum seekers to vietnam where there is " widespread torture , political detention and use of the death penalty . "
the german government 's human rights commissioner is also concerned .
" the human rights situation in vietnam is absolutely unsatisfactory , " guenter nooke told deutsche welle .
" i believe that people who can expect persecution and imprisonment in vietnam should not be deported . "
but of the refugees that have come to germany in the last few years , very few - at least according to german public agencies and courts - have reason to fear political reprisals back in vietnam .
vietnamese represent the third largest group of asylum applicants in germany , after iraqis and turks , but according to volker piening , berlin 's integration commissioner , only few are recognized as cases of political persecution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vietnamese children do especially well in german schools " the acceptance rate is roughly zero , " he said . " that means that of this group of asylum-seekers , there is a very large group of people who no longer have a right of residence .
this is why the vietnamese share of deportations in recent months has been comparatively high . "
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany came as guest workers .
their children are considered particularly ambitious and are accepted into germany 's college-prep high schools at rates higher than any other immigrant group , even higher than their german peers .

the spd , junior partners in merkel 's uneasy grand coalition , had expected to improve on 2004 's 21.5 percent . despite the negative trend , cdu general secretary ronald pofalla said his party was satisfied with the results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp was the biggest winner - party leader guido westerwelle with colleague silvana koch-mehrin " we will be able to build on these results in preparation for national elections in september .
we have achieved our mission : the cdu is by far the strongest political party in germany . " eu polls seen as a test for german national elections the social democrats ' poor showing is expected to trigger some searching questions ahead of september 's general election , in which both cdu and spd have hoped to seek new alternatives to their current uneasy grand coalition . " it is a disappointing result ; there is no other way of putting it , " german vice-chancellor frank-walter steinmeier , the spd 's candidate to challenge angela merkel , said . the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , merkel 's preferred coalition partners after september , were the biggest winner of sunday 's vote , with their score soaring to 10.6 percent from 6.1 percent . the greens were the third strongest party with 11.6 percent of the vote , compared to 11.9 percent in 2004 .
the hard-line socialist party the left improved its score to 7.5 percent from 6.1 percent .
but it was n't as high as had been predicted by some analysts .
the left had hoped to benefit more from voter dissatisfaction with the government ’ s attempts to deal with the economic crisis . campaigns dominated by national , not european issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaigning across germany failed to bring more people to the ballot box none of the remaining smaller parties managed to gather enough votes for a ticket to the european parliament .
the eu vote is seen as a crucial test for german national elections in september . leading into sunday 's election , voter turnout had been expected to be at a record low .
eventually , 43.3 percent of eligible german voters cast their ballots , up from 43 percent in 2004 . with its 99 seats , out of a total of 736 , germany has the largest contingent of deputies in the european parliament . election campaigns in germany had been dominated by national issues and the struggle against the global recession . av / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .
some 192 nations are taking part in the bonn talks , which are proving difficult because national interests and the competitiveness of various industrial sectors are at stake . " what is sometimes forgotten is that a large part of this process is about how 145 very poor countries are going to adapt to the impact of climate change and be helped to grow their economies in a cleaner way , " de boer said . the european union has offered a cut by 2020 of 20 percent compared to its emissions in 1990 .
the united states has proposed a cut of 17 percent compared to its emissions in 2005 , which translates to about four percent in comparison with 1990 . what 's at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts have said time is running out for the environment scientists have urged diplomats to adopt policies that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by the end of this century , saying any more might prove disastrous for life on earth . more than 20 million people have been displaced by climate-related sudden-onset natural disasters in 2008 alone , according to a new study by the norwegian refugee council 's internal displacement monitoring center and the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . at the start of the bonn talks , de boer said he was confident that the copenhagen meeting would succeed , although " there are some tough nuts to crack . "
parties to the talks will have at least three more chances to make their positions known ahead of the meeting in the danish capital .

in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
that permanently threatens the creation of quality works and independent journalism , " they warned .
staying solvent speaking at hamburg 's city hall , mathias doepfner , chairman of axel-springer ag , one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in europe , suggested that more that 500 media representatives both in and outside of the country depend on intellectual property rights to stay solvent .
" we do n't want any -lrb- state -rrb- subsidies , so we need support to protect our intellectual property , " doepfner added , saying that the print media and diversity of print media would only be able exist in the digital world for as long as they can protect their investments and are able to refinance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathias doepfner says strengthening copyright laws will ensure media companies wo n't need state aid " our goal has to be keeping the main avenues of the internet free of piracy - for music , films , books , journalism and all other protected goods . "
dagmar woehrl , under secretary at the economics ministry told the german website taggesschau.de that any further developments in the protection of copyrights needs to take place on an international , and not just national , level .
it 's still being debated whether copyrights should be strengthened or if audios , videos and texts should just be opened up to free redesign on the internet .
the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was an historically low turnout as less than 50 percent of those eligible to vote made their way to the polls .
when the final numbers are counted , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- , a collection of center-right conservatives will maintain its dominant position in the european parliament , albeit with less representation with anywhere from 267-271 seats according to early results .
socialists were expected to have between 157-161 seats , far fewer that in the 2004 elections and the greens managed to make headway as well , picking up ten new seats with 53 representatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions made their voice heard " i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " said european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia .
after four days of elections across the 27 member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” said martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us , " addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ said barroso . ”
in france , president nicolas sarkozy 's union for a popular movement won handily .
meanwhile , socialists who were badly divided because of a messy dispute between party head martine aubry and former presidential candidate segolene royal , looked to have their worst day at the polls in recent memory .
the green oriented european ecologie party did surprisingly well pulling in a bigger share than was expected .
in england , votes were still being counted , but gordon brown 's labour party seemed to be feeling the heat from not only the recession but from the expenses scandal that has led to multiple resignations from his cabinet .
italians were not punishing prime minister berlusconi or his party for a recent scandal about his alleged relationship with an 18 year old model .
greens are growing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everything is coming up green some green parties across the eu also did well , usually at the expense of socialist or left leaning parties .
" we made gains where we could articulate that the way out of the financial and economic crisis is through a green new deal to stimulate the economy .
this should strengthen our hand , ” said philippe lamberts , co-president of the european green party .
extremism noted of particular note in these elections was a slight uptick in the gains of extreme far-right and eurosceptic parties who appealed to voters ’ fatigue with immigration policies and to nationalist leanings .
small gains were made by these parties in austria , denmark and hungary .
in the netherlands , traditionally seen as a nation of tolerance , geert wilders ' far right anti-islamic party for freedom received enough votes to put it in second place .
in the uk , the far right british national party won their first seat in the eu parliament . av / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers have been hit hard as the internet gains popularity the slogan of the one-day media congress was : " no future for paid content ?
media industry under pressure , " and it was all about the internet and the future of print media .
in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .

"
dagmar woehrl , under secretary at the economics ministry told the german website taggesschau.de that any further developments in the protection of copyrights needs to take place on an international , and not just national , level .
it 's still being debated whether copyrights should be strengthened or if audios , videos and texts should just be opened up to free redesign on the internet .
the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the " international media dialogue " in hamburg on monday , leading publishing houses and the trade unions of the music , advertising and film industry warned about the economically devastating consequences of the " ongoing theft of intellectual property " on the internet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers have been hit hard as the internet gains popularity the slogan of the one-day media congress was : " no future for paid content ?

in a statement , the german producers alliance , the german association of communications agencies , and the big publishing houses springer , bauer , ganske , gruner & jahr , spiegel and zeit demanded legal protection in the digital world .
" countless providers are using the work of authors , publishers and broadcasters without paying for it .
that permanently threatens the creation of quality works and independent journalism , " they warned .
staying solvent speaking at hamburg 's city hall , mathias doepfner , chairman of axel-springer ag , one of the largest newspaper publishing companies in europe , suggested that more that 500 media representatives both in and outside of the country depend on intellectual property rights to stay solvent .
" we do n't want any -lrb- state -rrb- subsidies , so we need support to protect our intellectual property , " doepfner added , saying that the print media and diversity of print media would only be able exist in the digital world for as long as they can protect their investments and are able to refinance .

the french parliament has just passed a law allowing authorities to shut down internet connections for people who have been convicted of multiple copyright infringements .
however , it is still not how these people will be identified in a world in which changing a web site , and therefore the identifiable location of the infringed material , is just a few mouse clicks away. mrm / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bombing , which took place in the northern irish town of omagh in 1998 , claimed the lives of 29 people and wounded 200 others .
the court ruled that the real ira , an offshoot of the irish republican army , was responsible for the attack , which many consider to have been the bloodiest day in more than 30 years of sectarian violence in the british province .
the 12 named relatives had originally filed the civil suit for up to 14 million pounds in april 2008 against five men , but one of them was cleared .
among those found liable is michael mckevitt , the alleged leader of the real ira , who is serving a 20-year jail sentence for directing terrorism .
another , colm murphy , was found guilty in 2002 of conspiracy in the omagh bombing , but the conviction was later overturned .
while no one has been convicted in a criminal court for the bombing , and no one will be jailed as a result of the civil verdict , this case could set a precedent opening up the opportunity to sue other alleged members of paramilitary groups. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .
some 192 nations are taking part in the bonn talks , which are proving difficult because national interests and the competitiveness of various industrial sectors are at stake . " what is sometimes forgotten is that a large part of this process is about how 145 very poor countries are going to adapt to the impact of climate change and be helped to grow their economies in a cleaner way , " de boer said . the european union has offered a cut by 2020 of 20 percent compared to its emissions in 1990 .
the united states has proposed a cut of 17 percent compared to its emissions in 2005 , which translates to about four percent in comparison with 1990 . what 's at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts have said time is running out for the environment scientists have urged diplomats to adopt policies that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by the end of this century , saying any more might prove disastrous for life on earth . more than 20 million people have been displaced by climate-related sudden-onset natural disasters in 2008 alone , according to a new study by the norwegian refugee council 's internal displacement monitoring center and the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . at the start of the bonn talks , de boer said he was confident that the copenhagen meeting would succeed , although " there are some tough nuts to crack . "
parties to the talks will have at least three more chances to make their positions known ahead of the meeting in the danish capital .

it was the first group deportation for years in berlin .
refugee and human rights organisations protested against the move . it is the first time that the european union agency for external border security , frontex , is financing a group deportation .
one hundred and three women and men as well as one child were put on a plane to hanoi on monday evening .
around 200 demonstrators had gathered beforehand at berlin 's schoenefeld airport to protests against the mass deportation .
the case had attracted widespread public attention in recent days as many of the vietnamese immigrants had been living in germany for several years .
human rights and refugee organizations had organised opposition to the deportation , warning that the immigrants could face reprisals if sent back to vietnam .
" we are protesting primarily against the fact that we are deporting people to a country like vietnam that violates human rights , " said wolfgang lenk , a green party city counsellor who turned out to support the protest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some illegal vietnamese immigrants in germany have been involved in cigarette smuggling he warned that any form of mass deportation usually meant that individual cases were not considered with sufficient care .
despite a large police presence two demonstrators managed to enter the airport and were briefly detained by police , officials said .
most of vietnamese had been living in germany without residence permission , the 26 others had been living in poland .
the deportation operation was organised in cooperation between the german and polish authorities .
for many of the vietnamese , the trip home is the end of a long and difficult journey .
lured by the promises made by people smugglers of a better life , many of these would-be immigrants paid huge sums of money to get to germany , only to submit an asylum application that in most cases was rejected .
nevertheless , the number of new arrivals from the asian country has been growing , not just in germany , but also in neighboring poland and the czech republic .
about 85,000 vietnamese live legally in germany ; the number of undocumented vietnamese immigrants is unknown .
unlike this most recent wave of arrivals , the vietnamese who arrived in the 1970s and 1980s succeeded in establishing a life for themselves .
those in what was then west germany were " boat people " fleeing from the communist regime ; those in east germany arrived as guest workers. ai / dpa / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .

germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .

center-right parties from france , italy and germany have emerged as the strongest grouping in the european union parliamentary elections , at the expense of the socialists who suffered heavy losses . a record low voter turnout - 43.4 percent - in voting that ended sunday pointed to enduring voter apathy about the european union .
but europe 's conservatives held their own , with the european people 's party securing 267 seats in the 736-member strasbourg-based european parliament .
the socialists secured 159 seats with 81 seats for the liberal democrats , who came third in the polls , followed by the greens with 51 seats . center-right parties in the largest eu member states registered large gains in france , italy , spain and poland as well as in belgium , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , bulgaria and cyprus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's president nicolas sarkozy accompanied by his wife carla bruni-sarkozy at a polling booth in paris eu parliament presidennt hans-gert pöttering said the pro-european forces had stood their ground : " i expect all parties , who do not share this pro-european attitude , to work together in parliament in a productive manner , " the german conservative politician said .
some 388 million were eligible to vote for in elections for the european union 's only directly elected institution .
" i do n't expect any major difficulties in decision-making .
the composition of this parliament will not be significantly different from the previous one .
decisions on major issues were adopted in most cases by solid majorities , " european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said .
after four days of elections across the 27-member european union , voters did punish some national governments , but in the end , the socialists failed to capitalize on the perceived weakness of the conservatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi wins despite scandal over allegations he had an inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old model socialists ponder the future " it 's a sad evening for social democracy in europe , ” martin schulz , the leading candidate for the german socialists , said .
“ we are particularly disappointed ; it is a bitter evening for us . "
addressing reporters , european commission president jose manuel barroso thanked voters for participating in the electoral process .
" overall , the results are an undeniable victory for those parties and candidates that support the european project and want to see the european union delivering policy responses to their everyday concerns , “ barroso said .
far-right gains in the uk pressure on british prime minister gordon brown intensified sunday with a crushing defeat for his ruling labour party in european elections , which brought successes for anti-european and anti-immigration extremist parties .
the far-right british national party , which campaigns for a halt to immigration , won its first two seats to the european parliament .
mainstream parties lamented the breakthrough made by a party they regard as racist .
" it 's a sad moment for british politics , " health secretary andy burnham said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister gordon brown faces renewed calls for his resignation after his party 's dismal election result provisional results gave the labour party 14 percent of the vote , compared with 22 per cent in the last european poll in 2004 .
analysts said the result was the worst for labour in a nationwide poll since 1918 .
the ruling party was overtaken by ukip , the anti-european ukindependence party , which scored around 17 percent of the vote .
the conservatives led by david cameron improved their share of the vote to 29 per cent , while the liberal democrats , gained 14 per cent .
the full results for scotland and northern ireland will be announced later on monday .
there were also big gains for right-wing and euro-sceptic parties , especially in south-eastern europe , but also in the netherlands , austria and denmark. nrt / reuters / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is not enough to address climate change , " de boer said . the ipcc proposals , made in a 2007 report , call for a 25 percent to 40 percent reduction in emissions to limit the risk of climate change caused by human activity .
the bonn meeting , which ends on friday , is discussing new emission targets to be put in place after 2012 when the kyoto protocol on curbing greenhouse gas emissions expires . offers on the table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de boer has come out in favor of the eu 's plan the talks are designed to prepare the ground for negotiations in copenhagen in december , in which countries are intended to sign off on a successor to the kyoto protocol .
some 192 nations are taking part in the bonn talks , which are proving difficult because national interests and the competitiveness of various industrial sectors are at stake . " what is sometimes forgotten is that a large part of this process is about how 145 very poor countries are going to adapt to the impact of climate change and be helped to grow their economies in a cleaner way , " de boer said . the european union has offered a cut by 2020 of 20 percent compared to its emissions in 1990 .
the united states has proposed a cut of 17 percent compared to its emissions in 2005 , which translates to about four percent in comparison with 1990 . what 's at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts have said time is running out for the environment scientists have urged diplomats to adopt policies that would limit global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by the end of this century , saying any more might prove disastrous for life on earth . more than 20 million people have been displaced by climate-related sudden-onset natural disasters in 2008 alone , according to a new study by the norwegian refugee council 's internal displacement monitoring center and the office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs . at the start of the bonn talks , de boer said he was confident that the copenhagen meeting would succeed , although " there are some tough nuts to crack . "
parties to the talks will have at least three more chances to make their positions known ahead of the meeting in the danish capital .

according to a senior us official the troops are to be reduced to 10,000 by january 2010 .
currently , nato ’ s kfor troops number 15,000 soldiers . " kfor is looking to shift to the next phase of operations - to a deterrent presence , " the official told at a news briefing on monday .
he added that a review of the current mission had led to a reassessment of the security situation , which found that the time was right for a reduction of troops .
" this move is the next legal step in devolving responsibility to the local forces , but -lrb- we want -rrb- to do so in a way that maintains stability . "
the official said the military recommendation had been considered by nato ambassadors and was to be decided at a nato defence ministers meeting in brussels this week .
the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- was established after a 1999 nato bombing campaign ended fighting between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic-albanian majority in kosovo .
germany , with 2,300 troops in kosovo , has the largest contingent of any of the 38 countries that contribute soldiers to kfor . last month , the german parliament approved a 12-month extension of the bundeswehr troop presence in kosovo , saying that the situation in the region had improved but was still too fragile to warrant a pull-out .
in february 2008 kosovo declared independence from serbia and has been recognized by around 80 countries , including the us and most european union nations .
serbia and russia continue to oppose kosovo 's independence .
most of kosovo 's two million people are ethnic albanians but the landlocked balkan country continues to be rocked by ethnic tensions between serbs and albanians. ai / reuters / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ukip leader nigel farage : " that 's a hell of an achievement " the uk independence party has finished second in the european elections , ahead of labour , on an impressive night for the eurosceptic party .
it performed strongly in the east of england , where it won two seats and its total vote went up , and also picked up seats in yorkshire and london .
it gained 16.5 % of the vote and increased its number of meps to 13 , one more than it achieved in 2004 .
its leader nigel farage said the result showed its 2004 outcome was " no fluke " .
and he claimed the party would have gained even more votes if it had been allowed to properly debate the european issue , rather than mps expenses , which dominated the campaign .
' lisbon betrayal ' mr farage said the result was a " coup de grace " for gordon brown , who had broken labour 's promise to hold a referendum on the lisbon treaty .
he said the prime minister had " mocked and derided " ukip for being a fringe party and , with the result of this election , now must step down .
" if we have beaten him , he has got to go , " he told bbc news .
this time we 've come second in a major national election nigel farage the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said ukip 's performance in exceeding its 2004 's result - when it polled 16.2 % of the vote - was all the more impressive given that it did not have the benefit this time of the publicity generated by robert kilroy-silk .
mr kilroy-silk was elected for ukip in the east midlands region in 2004 but later quit the party after an internal row .
the party 's vote fell by 10 % in the east midlands this time around and the party lost one seat .
mr farage - re-elected as an mep for the south east region - said the 2009 result was " one hell of an achievement " given that the campaign had been dominated by domestic issues , particularly the expenses scandal .
voters were clearly disillusioned with the three main parties who did not feel they were being represented properly and being given a " chance to have their say " , he said .
" last time round we came third , " he said .
" everybody said it was a complete fluke , it would never be repeated , and this time we 've come second in a major national election . "
despite the projected gains , mr farage said he was disappointed key issues affecting the european union such as levels of bureaucracy and waste , immigration and the union 's further enlargement had been largely ignored .
' little debate ' " we have done what we can to have a conversation with the british public , " he said .
" what we have not been able to do is to ratchet that up to a big national debate . "
before the poll , mr farage said he would resign if ukip did n't improve on its 2004 performance .
ukip has threatened to challenge the result of the election after a row over folded ballot papers .
hundreds of people could not find the party 's box as it was hidden under a small fold at the bottom of the list of european election candidates , the party said .
mr farage said the handling of the election was " shameful " and needed to be investigated .
the government said returning officers ran elections and an alert had been put out once the problem emerged .

ukip leader nigel farage : " that 's a hell of an achievement " the uk independence party has finished second in the european elections , ahead of labour , on an impressive night for the eurosceptic party .
it performed strongly in the east of england , where it won two seats and its total vote went up , and also picked up seats in yorkshire and london .
it gained 16.5 % of the vote and increased its number of meps to 13 , one more than it achieved in 2004 .
its leader nigel farage said the result showed its 2004 outcome was " no fluke " .
and he claimed the party would have gained even more votes if it had been allowed to properly debate the european issue , rather than mps expenses , which dominated the campaign .
' lisbon betrayal ' mr farage said the result was a " coup de grace " for gordon brown , who had broken labour 's promise to hold a referendum on the lisbon treaty .
he said the prime minister had " mocked and derided " ukip for being a fringe party and , with the result of this election , now must step down .
" if we have beaten him , he has got to go , " he told bbc news .
this time we 've come second in a major national election nigel farage the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said ukip 's performance in exceeding its 2004 's result - when it polled 16.2 % of the vote - was all the more impressive given that it did not have the benefit this time of the publicity generated by robert kilroy-silk .
mr kilroy-silk was elected for ukip in the east midlands region in 2004 but later quit the party after an internal row .
the party 's vote fell by 10 % in the east midlands this time around and the party lost one seat .
mr farage - re-elected as an mep for the south east region - said the 2009 result was " one hell of an achievement " given that the campaign had been dominated by domestic issues , particularly the expenses scandal .
voters were clearly disillusioned with the three main parties who did not feel they were being represented properly and being given a " chance to have their say " , he said .
" last time round we came third , " he said .
" everybody said it was a complete fluke , it would never be repeated , and this time we 've come second in a major national election . "
despite the projected gains , mr farage said he was disappointed key issues affecting the european union such as levels of bureaucracy and waste , immigration and the union 's further enlargement had been largely ignored .
' little debate ' " we have done what we can to have a conversation with the british public , " he said .
" what we have not been able to do is to ratchet that up to a big national debate . "
before the poll , mr farage said he would resign if ukip did n't improve on its 2004 performance .
ukip has threatened to challenge the result of the election after a row over folded ballot papers .
hundreds of people could not find the party 's box as it was hidden under a small fold at the bottom of the list of european election candidates , the party said .
mr farage said the handling of the election was " shameful " and needed to be investigated .
the government said returning officers ran elections and an alert had been put out once the problem emerged .

' lisbon betrayal ' mr farage said the result was a " coup de grace " for gordon brown , who had broken labour 's promise to hold a referendum on the lisbon treaty .
he said the prime minister had " mocked and derided " ukip for being a fringe party and , with the result of this election , now must step down .
" if we have beaten him , he has got to go , " he told bbc news .
this time we 've come second in a major national election nigel farage the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said ukip 's performance in exceeding its 2004 's result - when it polled 16.2 % of the vote - was all the more impressive given that it did not have the benefit this time of the publicity generated by robert kilroy-silk .
mr kilroy-silk was elected for ukip in the east midlands region in 2004 but later quit the party after an internal row .
the party 's vote fell by 10 % in the east midlands this time around and the party lost one seat .
mr farage - re-elected as an mep for the south east region - said the 2009 result was " one hell of an achievement " given that the campaign had been dominated by domestic issues , particularly the expenses scandal .
voters were clearly disillusioned with the three main parties who did not feel they were being represented properly and being given a " chance to have their say " , he said .
" last time round we came third , " he said .
" everybody said it was a complete fluke , it would never be repeated , and this time we 've come second in a major national election . "
despite the projected gains , mr farage said he was disappointed key issues affecting the european union such as levels of bureaucracy and waste , immigration and the union 's further enlargement had been largely ignored .
' little debate ' " we have done what we can to have a conversation with the british public , " he said .
" what we have not been able to do is to ratchet that up to a big national debate . "
before the poll , mr farage said he would resign if ukip did n't improve on its 2004 performance .
ukip has threatened to challenge the result of the election after a row over folded ballot papers .
hundreds of people could not find the party 's box as it was hidden under a small fold at the bottom of the list of european election candidates , the party said .
mr farage said the handling of the election was " shameful " and needed to be investigated .
the government said returning officers ran elections and an alert had been put out once the problem emerged .

ukip leader nigel farage : " that 's a hell of an achievement " the uk independence party has finished second in the european elections , ahead of labour , on an impressive night for the eurosceptic party .
it performed strongly in the east of england , where it won two seats and its total vote went up , and also picked up seats in yorkshire and london .

carers ' week said it had found more than three-quarters of the estimated 340,000 carers in wales had reached " breaking point " due to their role .
researchers found 68 % had not had a respite break for more than a year and , of these , a third have never had a one .
the charity said carers should be " more visibly supported and appreciated " .
the survey found more than a third -lrb- 39 % -rrb- of respondents cited " frustration with bureaucracy " as the cause of reaching breaking point .
other factors listed included not being able to take a break , the deterioration of the person being cared for and lack of sleep .
respondents said " practical support " , followed by " the chance to take a break " and " someone to talk to " as factors that would or could have helped them . "
it has been a long arduous and extremely emotional journey " philip telfer on battling for help for his autistic son , christopher , 21 philip and julie telfer , of torfaen , care for their son christopher , 21 who has severe autism , epilepsy and severe challenging behaviour .
they have had three complaints upheld by the public services ombudsman for wales against gwent healthcare nhs trust , the local health board and social services .
a previous complaint regarding inconsistent respite support was also upheld by the public services ombudsman .
last year the couple were invited to 10 downing street to talk about caring for their autistic son but said they were unable to go because they could not find respite care .
mr telfer said : " having to constantly battle with health and social services to get services in place for our son has been horrendous .
money " it has been a long arduous and extremely emotional journey that has distressed us , causes us depression , stress and anxiety and has left us physically and mentally drained . "
more than third -lrb- 35 % -rrb- said more money would make a difference .
the main benefit for carers , carer 's allowance , is the lowest of its kind at just £ 53.10 per week .
carers ' week pointed to research by yougov which showed 77 % of the public in wales believe this was an unreasonable amount to support carers who were unable to work because of their caring responsibilities .
a total of 1,941 carers took part in the uk-wide survey , both online and by post , earlier this year with 142 respondents from wales .
carers week runs until 15 june and is the 15th year the event has been staged .
it is organised by a range of organisations and charities , ranging from carers uk , macmillan cancer support to the parkinson 's disease society .

carers ' week said it had found more than three-quarters of the estimated 340,000 carers in wales had reached " breaking point " due to their role .
researchers found 68 % had not had a respite break for more than a year and , of these , a third have never had a one .
the charity said carers should be " more visibly supported and appreciated " .
the survey found more than a third -lrb- 39 % -rrb- of respondents cited " frustration with bureaucracy " as the cause of reaching breaking point .
other factors listed included not being able to take a break , the deterioration of the person being cared for and lack of sleep .
respondents said " practical support " , followed by " the chance to take a break " and " someone to talk to " as factors that would or could have helped them .
it has been a long arduous and extremely emotional journey philip telfer on battling for help for his autistic son , christopher , 21 philip and julie telfer , of torfaen , care for their son christopher , 21 who has severe autism , epilepsy and severe challenging behaviour .
they have had three complaints upheld by the public services ombudsman for wales against gwent healthcare nhs trust , the local health board and social services .
a previous complaint regarding inconsistent respite support was also upheld by the public services ombudsman .
last year the couple were invited to 10 downing street to talk about caring for their autistic son but said they were unable to go because they could not find respite care .
mr telfer said : " having to constantly battle with health and social services to get services in place for our son has been horrendous .
money " it has been a long arduous and extremely emotional journey that has distressed us , causes us depression , stress and anxiety and has left us physically and mentally drained . "
more than third -lrb- 35 % -rrb- said more money would make a difference .
the main benefit for carers , carer 's allowance , is the lowest of its kind at just £ 53.10 per week .
carers ' week pointed to research by yougov which showed 77 % of the public in wales believe this was an unreasonable amount to support carers who were unable to work because of their caring responsibilities .
a total of 1,941 carers took part in the uk-wide survey , both online and by post , earlier this year with 142 respondents from wales .
carers week runs until 15 june and is the 15th year the event has been staged .
it is organised by a range of organisations and charities , ranging from carers uk , macmillan cancer support to the parkinson 's disease society .
