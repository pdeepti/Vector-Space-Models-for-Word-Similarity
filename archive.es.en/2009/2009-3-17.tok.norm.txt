in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.03.2009 nearly 2100 political prisoners held in myanmar : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has spent much of the past 19 years under house arrest the authorities in myanmar , also known as burma , arrested at least five members of the opposition national league for democracy party or nld on tuesday .
a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”
signature campaign in late february the junta released more than 6,000 prisoners .
only 29 of them were political detainees .
the issue of the release of political prisoners is picking up as the country approaches the general elections .
the junta has promised to hold elections in 2010 , which would be the country 's first vote in nearly two decades .
critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : nato turns 60 60 years of nato : 1949 – 1989 amid birthday celebrations , nato faces challenges of a changing world 60 years of nato : 1989 – present germany to push for change at nato jubilee summit nato -pipe- 17.03.2009 french parliament backs return to nato military command großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france returns to the nato fold after an absence of more than 40 years french president sarkozy 's government survived a confidence vote in parliament tuesday prompted by plans to rejoin nato ’ s integrated command , more than four decades after it pulled out in protest against us dominance . lawmakers voted 329 to 238 in favor of sarkozy 's foreign policy following a debate in the national assembly , the lower house of parliament .
conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .
the decision would see french generals take charge of two nato commands , though not in afghanistan . dfm / sp / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .

" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .

on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .

" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .

" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 17.03.2009 xenophobia on the rise among german youth , study says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says youths in eastern germany are much more likely to be hostile to foreigners the kids are not all right - that 's the finding of a recent survey of young germans .
particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "
expert opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in front of the court building demand more child protection some 300 journalists have traveled to the northeastern austrian town of sankt poelten to cover the trial .
but it is being held behind closed doors to protect the victims ' identities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister heads to us to explore gm-opel breakup german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has traveled to the united states to sound out the chances for german automaker opel to leave its struggling parent company , general motors .
-lrb- 16.03.2009 -rrb- europe to put on a united front in dealing with gm the stakes for europe are high .

but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”

in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .
so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”

a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”
signature campaign in late february the junta released more than 6,000 prisoners .
only 29 of them were political detainees .
the issue of the release of political prisoners is picking up as the country approaches the general elections .
the junta has promised to hold elections in 2010 , which would be the country 's first vote in nearly two decades .
critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .
so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”
the petition calls on u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon to make it his personal priority to secure the release of all political prisoners , adding it is an essential step towards restoring democracy in the country . du / afp / ap -lrb- 17/03/09 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 reader response feedback on kashmir , korea and other issues our readers and asia compact listeners are passionate about sending in their views .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .

the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "

but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "

" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .

entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”

only 29 of them were political detainees .

critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”

but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .

flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .

he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .
" a coward till the end , " said the tabloid kronen zeitung , while the kurier said : " fritzl only feels sorry for himself . " sac / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .

lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.03.2009 nearly 2100 political prisoners held in myanmar : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has spent much of the past 19 years under house arrest the authorities in myanmar , also known as burma , arrested at least five members of the opposition national league for democracy party or nld on tuesday .
a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”
signature campaign in late february the junta released more than 6,000 prisoners .
only 29 of them were political detainees .
the issue of the release of political prisoners is picking up as the country approaches the general elections .
the junta has promised to hold elections in 2010 , which would be the country 's first vote in nearly two decades .
critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .
so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”
the petition calls on u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon to make it his personal priority to secure the release of all political prisoners , adding it is an essential step towards restoring democracy in the country . du / afp / ap -lrb- 17/03/09 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .

so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.03.2009 nearly 2100 political prisoners held in myanmar : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has spent much of the past 19 years under house arrest the authorities in myanmar , also known as burma , arrested at least five members of the opposition national league for democracy party or nld on tuesday .
a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”
signature campaign in late february the junta released more than 6,000 prisoners .
only 29 of them were political detainees .
the issue of the release of political prisoners is picking up as the country approaches the general elections .
the junta has promised to hold elections in 2010 , which would be the country 's first vote in nearly two decades .
critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .
so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”
the petition calls on u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon to make it his personal priority to secure the release of all political prisoners , adding it is an essential step towards restoring democracy in the country . du / afp / ap -lrb- 17/03/09 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic kashmir earthquake five years ago , an earthquake struck pakistan-administered kashmir , killing some 80,000 people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

but it is being held behind closed doors to protect the victims ' identities .
austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.03.2009 german minister : gm has given in on opel stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg , right , was all smiles after meeting with gm execs after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .
but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .
still , guttenberg seems confident that the conditions for a solution for opel , if not the solution itself , have been created . jc / jen / ap / afp / ard send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister heads to us to explore gm-opel breakup german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has traveled to the united states to sound out the chances for german automaker opel to leave its struggling parent company , general motors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .

flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .

" he 's already said everything , " mayer said as he arrived at the courthouse .
he would not comment on monday 's proceedings .
fritzl was questioned at the start of the trial after the first excerpts of elisabeth 's testimony were shown .
court spokesman franz cutka said elisabeth 's statements , which were videotaped to spare her an appearance in court , were expected to be shown in their entirety during the trial .
he said authorities had also recorded just under an hour of further testimony by one of her brothers , harald .
no other family members agreed to testify .
cutka said final pleas " could be made on thursday morning and that means we could expect to have a verdict on thursday afternoon . "

austrian broadcaster orf reported that expert opinions would play a significant role in the trial .
the court is to hear the findings of psychiatric specialist adelheid kastner , as well as from experts in neonatology , electro mechanics and ventilation technology , orf said .
" face of evil " fritzl pleaded guilty on monday to incest , rape and sequestration .
but the 73-year-old denied murder and enslavement charges .
he depicted himself in court as a victim of family neglect during his own childhood .
the prosecution alleges that fritzl murdered his own baby in 1996 by failing to provide it with appropriate medical care .
fritzl testified that the baby was stillborn and that he burnt the body .
he faces life in prison if convicted of the charge .
his lawyer , mayer , argued that the retired austrian engineer had sought a second family to the one he had with his wife rosemarie .
but austria 's press has described him as the embodiment of evil .
" this is the face of evil , " read the headline of the daily kleine zeitung , alongside a picture of fritzl hiding his face behind a blue document folder as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial 's opening .
" a coward till the end , " said the tabloid kronen zeitung , while the kurier said : " fritzl only feels sorry for himself . " sac / sp / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .

berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .

" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .

" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .

the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .

flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .
the decision would see french generals take charge of two nato commands , though not in afghanistan . dfm / sp / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .
the decision would see french generals take charge of two nato commands , though not in afghanistan . dfm / sp / dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .

lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .

but a deal is far from done . guttenberg 's remarks came amidst a trip to the american capital that will see the german economics minister meet with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and larry summers , the director of the national economic council .
on monday , march 16 , guttenberg met with the head of general motors , rick wagoner , for talks about the troubled automotive giant and its european subsidiary .
germany would like to see greater independence for opel so that the state could take measures to save the carmaker without pouring money into gm .
general motors had previously refused to reduce its stake in opel , but in what became a game of brinksmanship , detroit appears to have blinked first .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin would like to help opel without funding gm " there 's been one important concession , " guttenberg told reporters .
" they 've made it clear that they 're prepared to take a minority holding .
that 's important if we 're to re-define the concept of general motors in europe . "
berlin is keen to ensure that any money allocated for bailing out opel in europe does not get redirected to gm in america .
the detroit carmaker also signaled willingness to compromise on patents and licenses that might be developed by a reformed opel .
and guttenberg said a mediator would be appointed to liaise between the company and the german government .
some 29,000 people are employed at opel 's german facilities .
but a lot would still need to happen to convince the german government to take a stake in the company .
search for a savior bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 50,000 opel-related jobs in germany are at stake guttenberg has repeatedly stressed that any solution aimed at saving opel must include private investors .
thus far , no one has stepped up to buy a major share in the european carmaker , though that could change .
" there have been some inquiries i would think of as serious , but gm , as the parent company , needs to react to them , " guttenberg told the german public broadcaster ard .
" until now this reaction has been missing . "
another complication is the fact that gm has used patent rights and shares as collateral for the loans it has taken out from the us government .
guttenberg is expected to raise that issue with his american counterpart timothy geithner when they meet later on tuesday .
gm itself has two weeks to present a rescue plan to washington - or risk losing state support .
more and more critics are skeptical about whether it makes sense to invest in the automotive giant .

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .

lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .

a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .
in a 41 page report quintana says detainees are suffering from a lack of medical care and physical ill-treatment and that nearly 600 of them have rarely seen their families because they are being held in jails far from their hometowns .
quintana has also called for an urgent and independent review of the case of nobel laureate aung san suu kyi , who has been kept under house arrest for nearly six years .
“ the junta must listen to the un and the international community ’ s concerns , ” says soe aung , a pro-democracy activist from myanmar , who is now based in bangkok .
“ the release of aung san suu kyi and other political prisoners has become an international benchmark to judge the state of democracy in the country . ”
signature campaign in late february the junta released more than 6,000 prisoners .
only 29 of them were political detainees .
the issue of the release of political prisoners is picking up as the country approaches the general elections .
the junta has promised to hold elections in 2010 , which would be the country 's first vote in nearly two decades .
critics say the polls would be sham unless pro-democracy leaders , such as suu kyi , are released and take part in them .
in a bid to put more pressure on the junta , a global signature campaign is also under way .
activist soe aung , who is also the spokesperson of the ‘ free burma 's political prisoners now ’ campaign , explains : “ the campaign has been initiated by exile organisations and nearly 173 burma support groups , who are collecting signatures and then will give them to un secretary general ban ki moon , urging him to work harder to secure the release of the political prisoners . ”
putting pressure on the un the aim is to collect 888,888 signatures by may 24 when suu kyi ’ s house arrest is due to end .
activist soe aung says the number of signatures is highly significant : " the 888,888 signatures symbolise the aug 88 movement , when at least 3,000 people sacrificed their lives in yangon and other cities .
so in order to remember what happened 20 years ago , we are aiming to reach this figure in the petition . ”
the petition calls on u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon to make it his personal priority to secure the release of all political prisoners , adding it is an essential step towards restoring democracy in the country . du / afp / ap -lrb- 17/03/09 -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .

" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .

vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .

" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .

conservative prime minister francois fillon proposed the no-confidence motion amid strong opposition to boosting ties with nato .
but the challenge was unlikely to succeed given that sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party holds a majority of 317 seats in the 577-member national assembly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy wants france to have a greater say in nato sarkozy had said that france 's return to full nato membership , which he announced march 11 , would strengthen european defense capabilities by giving paris a say in the alliance 's mission strategies and planning .
" now we have soldiers deployed on the ground ... but no influence on the missions in which they participate , " sarkozy said .
" we have excluded ourselves . "
vocal opposition to move the move , widely viewed as one of sarkozy 's most important foreign policy changes , prompted strong protest across france 's political spectrum . critics feared it would diminish the country 's diplomatic influence and independence .
four former prime ministers , including two from conservative ranks - alain juppe and dominique de villepin - publicly expressed opposition to the move , saying it would put france under washington 's thumb .
many french lawmakers believed former president charles de gaulle was right to pull france out of nato 's military command and evict us bases from french soil in 1966 .
" when you look at the basis of general de gaulle 's decision in 1966 , it was taken because , with an eye to the future , he was opposed to the bipolar world and he was calling for a multipolar world , " senior socialist laurent fabius said during the debate in the national assembly .
" just as this multipolar world is within sight , you are clinging on to the logic of two blocs and ensuring that the alpha and omega of your position is the defence of nato and of the west , and we do not accept this concept which is dangerous because it is the basis of tensions in the world , " he added .
pm says change in line with reality prime minister fillon said on tuesday rejoining nato 's integrated command was in line with modern-day reality , and that paris would only benefit from the change .
" nato is no longer the organization some people speak of .
forty years ago , general de gaulle was withdrawing from a compact organisation , an organisation erected against the warsaw pact and led exclusively by the united states , " fillon said .
" since then , the notion of coalitions , of willing states and variable participation has imposed itself to the detriment of the rigid mindsets of the cold war , " he added .
france 's return to the integrated command is expected to become official at a nato summit in the eastern french city of strasbourg and at kehl across the border in germany on april 3-4 .
france is the fourth-largest contributor of troops to nato and has some 2,800 soldiers deployed in afghanistan .

hypo real estate said in a statement that the guarantees collateralize the notes which were subscribed by a consortium of german banks and insurance companies .
" our thanks go to the german government for the trust placed in our bank , as demonstrated by the extension of the credit facility , " hre 's chief executive axel wieandt said in a statement .
wieandt said the extension of guarantees for hre was a positive sign for negotiations with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , for more long-term capital support .
the german finance ministry has also indicated that it was prepared to extend the term of the guarantee covering the remaining 20 billion euros of the liquidity ceiling , hre said .
recapitalization instead of nationalization hypo real estate suffered severe liquidity problems last september in the wake of the subprime mortgage meltdown in the united states .
the bank has already soaked up more than € 100 billion euros in direct state aid and public loan guarantees . the german government has proposed new laws that pave the way for hre to be nationalised by seizing shares if necessary - a taboo in germany as it revives memories of nazi and communist expropriations of businesses in the last century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers came to berlin to testify before the parliament 's finance committee on monday , the bank 's biggest stakeholder , us private equity firm jc flowers , told a german parliamentary committee that nationalizing hre would be the wrong step to take . flowers told the finance committee to take a stake in the bank through recapitalization instead .
flowers holds approximately one quarter of hre 's shares , which his company bought last year for 1.1 billion euros .
but according to the federal financial supervisory authority bafin , hre 's total market capitalization currently only amounts to 190 million euros .
flowers disputed the idea that a nationalized hre would improve its rating .
he said that he viewed the bank 's future positively and expected an increase in stock price .
but he admitted that it was dependent on the government .
" hre could not survive without government support , " flowers told the committee .
disastrous repercussions authorities fear a chain-reaction on financial markets in germany and further afield if the bank is allowed to go under .
the head of soffin warned in a newspaper interview published sunday of catastrophic consequences if hre were allowed to collapse .
" i 'd go so far as to say , if this bank were not rescued , it could have worse consequences than the bankruptcy of lehman brothers , " hannes rehm told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung . sac / sp / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 17.03.2009 nearly 2100 political prisoners held in myanmar : un großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi has spent much of the past 19 years under house arrest the authorities in myanmar , also known as burma , arrested at least five members of the opposition national league for democracy party or nld on tuesday .
a spokesman of the nld said the police detained the party members without any explanation .
the latest arrests come just a day after the un ’ s special rapporteur on human rights in myanmar released a report urging the junta to release all political prisoners and to allow them to participate in an election set for 2010 . tomas okea quintana ’ s assessment is based on his visit to myanmar in february this year .
the un human rights envoy says more than 2,100 political prisoners are being held in myanmar ’ s prisons after being sentenced at secret hearings , often without proof and without legal representation .

in bahia , over 50 percent of the population live below the poverty line .
those who are able , tend to move elsewhere . ismael ferreira is one of those who decided to stay in his home town of valente .
the son of a farmer , he opted to study agriculture .
then , more than 20 years ago , he started to recultivate sisal , a plant that no one wanted to grow anymore .
and yet nothing grows as well in this semi-arid region as sisal , able to survive with very little water . ismael ferreira set up a kind of cooperative , which today is the biggest employer in and around valente .
the company also has a factory where sisal fibers are used to make carpets .
a lot of the company 's output is exported abroad .
and that is where this company in a small town in brazil is feeling the effects of globalization .
for quite some time now , the factory has been fighting to survive because of currency fluctuations , in particular because of the weak dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.03.2009 eu rejects tightening sanctions against belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus ' opposition groups would like closer ties to the eu the council of the european union has agreed to extend its suspension of sanctions against belarus , including a visa ban for top officials .
but concerns linger whether the regime will improve its human rights record . the council of the european union has welcomed " positive steps " in belarus and has extended its suspension of travel restrictions for top government officials for a further nine months .
the prolonged visa ban , introduced in october 2008 , covers over 30 officials and belarusian president alexander lukashenko , whose regime former us secretary of state condoleezza rice once called " the last remaining true dictatorship in the heart of europe . "
the council said it would observe further developments and carry out " an in-depth review of the restrictive measures " in belarus by the end of the nine-month period .
" provided that there are further positive developments , it will be ready to consider the possibility of lifting the restrictive measures , " the council said in a statement following a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , march 16 .
however , the council decided to prolong other sanctions for another year , including an arms embargo and assets freeze .
these had been introduced in 2006 following accusations that lukashenko rigged the country 's elections .
human rights still need improvement the council said it may " at any time " decide to re-apply the travel restrictions if necessary .
this would depend on " the actions of the belarusian authorities in the sphere of democracy and human rights . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian gas pipelines to europe run through belarus finland 's foreign minister alexander stubb said there was still much work to be done , though belarus had begun to improve its record on human rights .
" on a scale from one to 10 , i 'd say we 're probably at two or three , " stubb said .
" but i think things are moving in the right direction . "
lukashenko has ruled the former soviet republic in an authoritarian manner since 1994 .
but he has made recent attempts at greater openness including the hiring of a western pr firm and cautious economic reform .
last year , the government also released leading opposition politicians from prison .
the bloc 's external affairs commissioner , benita ferrero-waldner , said the return of two previously banned independent newspapers to the newsstands provided evidence that some " progress has been made in belarus . "
" but it is not enough , " said ferrero-waldner .
the council said it continued to be concerned about the human rights situation in belarus and recent cases of violations .
" the council stresses the importance for belarus to address the concerns raised in this regard and to continue moving forward , through progressive substantial steps , " it said in the statement .
a partnership with belarus ?
the belarusian foreign ministry welcomed the eu move , but called for the lifting of all sanctions .
" this decision will allow pragmatic dialog between belarus and the eu to continue , " foreign ministry spokesman andrei popov said .
" at the same time , we firmly believe it is long overdue to proceed with a full lifting of all restrictions which hinder the development of normal relations between belarus and the eu . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev wants to continue close ties to lukashenko the foreign ministers did not decide whether to invite lukashenko to a may 7 summit in prague that will launch the eu 's eastern partnership , an initiative designed to boost ties with the bloc 's eastern neighbors .
" whether lukashenko is invited depends on if he is willing to underline publicly that the process of democratization and opening up of belarus will be continued , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters .
access to the partnership would allow belarus to enjoy a series of benefits , including financial aid , easier access to visas and greater cooperation on trade and energy security .
eu leaders meeting in brussels for a summit later this week are expected to decide on the lukashenko invitation to prague .
opposition calls for more action belarusian opposition leader anatoly lebedko called on the eu to exert more pressure on the government .
lebedko , leader of the united civil party , said brussels should demand a precise timetable for democratic reforms in belarus , according to the independent belarusian news agency belapan .
otherwise , the government could lose its motivation for change , he said .
lebedko said lukashenko 's dialog with the eu did not include any other political parties or non-governmental organizations .
" this dialog will not lead to any positive results , " he said .
last week , lebedko already opposed inviting lukashenko to the eu summit in prague . sac / jen / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

particularly worrisome is a rise in hostility toward foreigners .
but germany 's interior minister also sees reason for hope . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble and the director of the institute that carried out the study , christian pfeiffer , presented it to the public in berlin on tuesday , march 17 .
entitled " young people in germany as victims and perpetrators of violence , " the study surveyed attitudes on a variety of issues among 45,000 ninth-graders .
the survey found that one in every seven young germans , or 14.4 percent , could be considered " very hostile to foreigners . "
and just under 30 percent responded in the affirmative when asked whether they thought whether there were too many foreigners in germany .
the study also found that 4.9 percent of male respondents were affiliated with far-right groups - far more than were involved in mainstream german politics .
" it 's terrible that the far right has more success attracting young males than the established political parties , " pfeiffer told reporters .
schaeuble said he was " shocked " by the results .
in addition , 6.4 percent of young males gave answers that suggested they held antisemitic views .
silver lining ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble says the study does have a bright side but the news from the study , which was done by the lower saxony criminological research institute , was not all bad .
the institute found that today 's german youth was no more violent than past generations .
" it needs to be particularly stressed that , in contrast to the public perception , violence among young people has either slightly declined or remained steady in the cities we 've looked at since 1998 , " pfeiffer said .
schaeuble said the study had given him reason for optimism .
the interior minister said the results included " a lot of reasons to act " but that they also engendered " the feeling that it is worth taking action . "
still , the study recorded a slight rise in serious cases of violence .
4.8 percent of respondents said they had been the victims of serious acts of violence . jc / sp / epd / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two thirds of vice-chancellors , speaking anonymously , said they needed to raise fees , suggesting levels of between £ 4,000 and £ 20,000 per year .
more than half of university heads want students to pay at least £ 5,000 per year or for there to be no upper limit .
england 's higher education minister david lammy said there was an " important debate to be had " .
the national union of students has warned of debts of £ 32,000 for students if fees rise to £ 7,000 per year .
higher debt the controversy over tuition fees is set to be re-opened , five years after it sparked one of the biggest backbench rebellions faced by the labour government .
university fees must be reviewed this year by the government - and there are already arguments about whether the present £ 3,500 cap on fees should be lifted .
any changes will affect about a million students on undergraduate courses .
universities uk has set out the consequences of fee levels of £ 5,000 and £ 7,000 - arguing that if fees reached £ 7,000 a market of differently priced courses would emerge .
this has angered the national union of students , which wants to entirely replace the fee system with repayments linked to later earnings .
" in the context of the current recession , it is extremely arrogant for university vice chancellors to be fantasising about charging their students even higher fees and plunging them into over £ 32,000 of debt , " said nus president wes streeting .
students are now planning a lobby of the house of commons on wednesday in a protest against increasing fees .
sally hunt , leader of the ucu lecturers ' union , accused vice chancellors of " ignoring the views of the general public as they try to secure more cash by any means possible " .
labour backbenchers are also mobilising on the issue - with mp paul farrelly , a former fee rebel , putting down a motion in the house of commons warning against any plans to hike fees .
mr farrelly said the government would ignore " at its peril " the risks of pushing through another fee increase .

about one in 10 wanted the cap scrapped altogether so universities could charge whatever they wanted .
there was widespread support among vice-chancellors for the principle of fees - three out of four believing they had been a successful policy and nine out of 10 saying they should not be scrapped .
two thirds believed fees had not deterred applications from students from poorer families .
the need to review them , part of the deal struck in 2004 , will be highly sensitive for labour - raising questions about its appeal both to its left wing and to middle-class supporters .
' won the argument ' the westminster government has so far refused to be drawn into speculation about any changes .
" we made a commitment to parliament during the last fees review that we would return to the issue only after the first cohort of students paying under the current regime had finished their degrees , " said mr lammy .
" we are not breaking that commitment .
" there is an important debate to be had now , which is about how we maintain the world class status of our higher education sector . "

plaid cymru has restated its opposition to fees .
but under proposals put out for consultation by education minister jane hutt , the student subsidy would be replaced the following year by means-tested grants .
' resistance ' charles clarke , who as education secretary took on fees rebels in 2004 , says the westminster government has been proved right about introducing fees .

two thirds of vice-chancellors , speaking anonymously , said they needed to raise fees , suggesting levels of between £ 4,000 and £ 20,000 per year .
more than half of university heads want students to pay at least £ 5,000 per year or for there to be no upper limit .
england 's higher education minister david lammy said there was an " important debate to be had " .
the national union of students has warned of debts of £ 32,000 for students if fees rise to £ 7,000 per year .
higher debt the controversy over tuition fees is set to be re-opened , five years after it sparked one of the biggest backbench rebellions faced by the labour government .
university fees must be reviewed this year by the government - and there are already arguments about whether the present £ 3,500 cap on fees should be lifted .

students considering university are concerned by rising fees any changes will affect about a million students on undergraduate courses .
universities uk has set out the consequences of fee levels of £ 5,000 and £ 7,000 - arguing that if fees reached £ 7,000 a market of differently priced courses would emerge .
this has angered the national union of students , which wants to entirely replace the fee system with repayments linked to later earnings .
" in the context of the current recession , it is extremely arrogant for university vice chancellors to be fantasising about charging their students even higher fees and plunging them into over £ 32,000 of debt , " said nus president wes streeting .
students are now planning a lobby of the house of commons on wednesday in a protest against increasing fees .
sally hunt , leader of the ucu lecturers ' union , accused vice chancellors of " ignoring the views of the general public as they try to secure more cash by any means possible " .
labour backbenchers are also mobilising on the issue - with mp paul farrelly , a former fee rebel , putting down a motion in the house of commons warning against any plans to hike fees .
mr farrelly said the government would ignore " at its peril " the risks of pushing through another fee increase .
recession and resistance the bbc survey , gathering the views of 53 university vice-chancellors , showed a wide range of expectations of the scale of any increase - from £ 4,000 to £ 20,000 per year .
there is an important debate to be had now , which is about how we maintain the world class status of our higher education sector higher education minister david lammy there were also some expectations of differences between universities and courses - with more than a quarter saying they would not charge the full amount .
about one in 10 wanted the cap scrapped altogether so universities could charge whatever they wanted .
there was widespread support among vice-chancellors for the principle of fees - three out of four believing they had been a successful policy and nine out of 10 saying they should not be scrapped .
two thirds believed fees had not deterred applications from students from poorer families .
the need to review them , part of the deal struck in 2004 , will be highly sensitive for labour - raising questions about its appeal both to its left wing and to middle-class supporters .
' won the argument ' the westminster government has so far refused to be drawn into speculation about any changes .
" we made a commitment to parliament during the last fees review that we would return to the issue only after the first cohort of students paying under the current regime had finished their degrees , " said mr lammy .
" we are not breaking that commitment .

karpal singh pleaded innocent to the charge of insulting sultan azlan shah of perak state and was freed on bail .
his arrest came a day after his son , mp gopind singh deo , was suspended from parliament for calling the deputy prime minister , najib razak , a murderer .
mr najib is expected to become prime minister in the next few weeks amid rising political tensions .
" obviously it is politically motivated .
there can be no doubt about that , " said mr singh , chairman of the opposition democratic action party -lrb- dap -rrb- .
he accused the government of using the sedition act " as a political weapon against its political opponents . "
under malaysian law , any act that provokes hatred , contempt or disaffection against a state ruler is considered sedition .
the crime carries a maximum sentence of three years .
a trial date has yet to be set .
political struggle the case comes amid a power tussle in perak .
following elections in march 2008 , the state was governed by a three-party opposition alliance that included the dap .
but earlier this year , three perak state legislators defected , tipping the balance in favour of the governing national front coalition .
the sultan of perak fired the alliance 's administration and asked the national front to govern - a move that was questioned by karpal singh , and led to his arrest .
the opposition is campaigning for fresh state elections .
meanwhile , the likely appointment of najib razak as prime minister has resurrected allegations of his involvement in a long-running scandal over the murder of a mongolian woman .
mr singh 's son was suspended from parliament for one year on monday after he called mr najib a murderer , referring to the 2006 case of the death of altantuya shaariibuu .
the national front has ruled malaysia for more than 50 years .
but the opposition three-party alliance won an unprecedented five of malaysia 's 13 states in general elections last year , in a dramatic shift in the balance of power .

karpal singh pleaded innocent to the charge of insulting sultan azlan shah of perak state and was freed on bail .
his arrest came a day after his son , mp gopind singh deo , was suspended from parliament for calling the deputy prime minister , najib razak , a murderer .
mr najib is expected to become prime minister in the next few weeks amid rising political tensions .
" obviously it is politically motivated .
there can be no doubt about that , " said mr singh , chairman of the opposition democratic action party -lrb- dap -rrb- .
he accused the government of using the sedition act " as a political weapon against its political opponents . "
under malaysian law , any act that provokes hatred , contempt or disaffection against a state ruler is considered sedition .
the crime carries a maximum sentence of three years .
a trial date has yet to be set .
political struggle the case comes amid a power tussle in perak .
following elections in march 2008 , the state was governed by a three-party opposition alliance that included the dap .
but earlier this year , three perak state legislators defected , tipping the balance in favour of the governing national front coalition .
the sultan of perak fired the alliance 's administration and asked the national front to govern - a move that was questioned by karpal singh , and led to his arrest .
the opposition is campaigning for fresh state elections .
meanwhile , the likely appointment of najib razak as prime minister has resurrected allegations of his involvement in a long-running scandal over the murder of a mongolian woman .
mr singh 's son was suspended from parliament for one year on monday after he called mr najib a murderer , referring to the 2006 case of the death of altantuya shaariibuu .
the national front has ruled malaysia for more than 50 years .
but the opposition three-party alliance won an unprecedented five of malaysia 's 13 states in general elections last year , in a dramatic shift in the balance of power .

the directive aims to limit the working week to 48 hours .

jason mulheron was said to have made the claims after ms jones ' body was found in queen 's park in glasgow .
the evidence was heard at the high court in glasgow during the trial of 33-year-old marek harcar .
the slovakian has lodged a defence of incrimination blaming three others for the murder of ms jones last may .

det sgt calum crawford told the jury he was part of the inquiry team in miss jones ' death .
harcar 's qc paul mcbride put mulheron 's previous convictions to the police officer .
mr mcbride said : " would it also be of interest that this individual -lrb- mulheron -rrb- was said to have admitted the crime -lrb- of miss jones ' murder -rrb- ? "
ds crawford replied : " yes , it would be of interest . "
mr mcbride also asked : " someone like jason mulheron would be of interest to the police in this type of enquiry a man who committed an offence not long before miss jones died ? "
the officer replied : " yes . "
the jury was also told that 22 registered sex offenders lived within the area of the attack .
it was also shown cctv footage of mr harcar entering osc shoe shop in argyle street , glasgow , where he tried on a pair of shoes and bought a pair of white adidas trainers .

people have lived on this archipelago for 3,000 years , and from the air it looks absolutely wonderful .
but down below is the front line in the fight against sea level rise .
we land at a remote atoll - maduvari - with maldives vice-president mohamed waheed .
it is home to about 2,000 people .
the vice-president takes me to a beach that used to be a paved road 3m -lrb- 15ft -rrb- wide - it has now been reclaimed by the sea .
and houses nearby are crumbling into the water .
" there is a natural process , or erosion , going on , " dr waheed says .
" but that process is being worsened by changing global weather patterns . "
" without the coral there is no maldives .
instead of sea walls , the coral reefs protect the islands " robert tomasetti , marine biologist " how long do you think this island can be inhabited ? "
i ask .
" not more than 20 years , " he says .
" then we 'll have to abandon it .
children growing up in primary school now wo n't be able to live here . "
' big islands ' so they are fighting against the sea on maduvari - dredging sand from the lagoon to build temporary defences .
but recently-elected president mohamed nasheed has warned that he might have to find not just a new island but a whole new country unless sea level rise can be contained .
it is an existential threat .
and so this week the president announced that the maldives hoped to become the world 's first carbon neutral country within 10 years , meeting all its energy needs from renewable sources like wind and solar power .
it is a strong statement of intent , and it will probably cost $ 1bn to implement .
but it is designed to prod the rest of the world into action .
because if the maldives acts alone , it will perish .
so it is appealing for international cooperation while it continues to search for practical local solutions to the threat posed by rising seas .
one possible solution is to build higher artificial islands .
some 80 % of the country 's land mass is less than a metre above mean sea level , but on the island of hulumale you can actually look down on the sea from a height .
there is a natural reef protecting the island , and a lagoon between the reef and the beach .
but the whole island has been raised and reclaimed using sand , concrete and shingle , to protect it from storm surges and higher tides .
some environmental groups have concerns about the way the hulumale project was implemented , but they argue that the basic idea could provide a solution that will allow people to continue living in the maldives for hundreds of years .
" we 're proposing big islands which are built up to three metres high in seven different parts of the country , " ali rilwan from the ngo bluepeace says .
" that will be enough for the entire population of 300,000 people .
" so the people who do n't want to leave , those who do n't want to become climate refugees - they can move to higher ground within the maldives . "
and then there is the country 's natural defence system - the coral reefs .
a decade ago most of the coral in the maldives was wiped out by a sudden rise in sea temperatures caused by the el nino weather phenomenon .
now small private marine research centres - many of them based at luxury resort islands - are re-growing coral and trying to understand more about its role in protecting the eco-system .
" really very little scientific research has been done , partly because there 's no university in the maldives , " says robert tomasetti , a marine biologist who works at the banyan tree resort .
" but all the sand here is formed from the corals , the shells and the algae .
without the coral there is no maldives .
instead of sea walls , the coral reefs protect the islands . "
so new reefs , higher islands and , in the future , a decarbonised economy .
but if paradise is to be preserved , much more international help will be needed - to fund further research on local solutions , and to take decisive global action against climate change .

now small private marine research centres - many of them based at luxury resort islands - are re-growing coral and trying to understand more about its role in protecting the eco-system .
" really very little scientific research has been done , partly because there 's no university in the maldives , " says robert tomasetti , a marine biologist who works at the banyan tree resort .
" but all the sand here is formed from the corals , the shells and the algae .
without the coral there is no maldives .
instead of sea walls , the coral reefs protect the islands . "
so new reefs , higher islands and , in the future , a decarbonised economy .

and so this week the president announced that the maldives hoped to become the world 's first carbon neutral country within 10 years , meeting all its energy needs from renewable sources like wind and solar power .
it is a strong statement of intent , and it will probably cost $ 1bn to implement .

there is a natural reef protecting the island , and a lagoon between the reef and the beach .
but the whole island has been raised and reclaimed using sand , concrete and shingle , to protect it from storm surges and higher tides .
some environmental groups have concerns about the way the hulumale project was implemented , but they argue that the basic idea could provide a solution that will allow people to continue living in the maldives for hundreds of years .
" we 're proposing big islands which are built up to three metres high in seven different parts of the country , " ali rilwan from the ngo bluepeace says .
" that will be enough for the entire population of 300,000 people .

people have lived on this archipelago for 3,000 years , and from the air it looks absolutely wonderful .
but down below is the front line in the fight against sea level rise .
we land at a remote atoll - maduvari - with maldives vice-president mohamed waheed .
it is home to about 2,000 people .
the vice-president takes me to a beach that used to be a paved road 3m -lrb- 15ft -rrb- wide - it has now been reclaimed by the sea .
and houses nearby are crumbling into the water .

advertisement a closer look at the damage being caused in the maldives but recently-elected president mohamed nasheed has warned that he might have to find not just a new island but a whole new country unless sea level rise can be contained .
it is an existential threat .
and so this week the president announced that the maldives hoped to become the world 's first carbon neutral country within 10 years , meeting all its energy needs from renewable sources like wind and solar power .
it is a strong statement of intent , and it will probably cost $ 1bn to implement .
but it is designed to prod the rest of the world into action .
because if the maldives acts alone , it will perish .
so it is appealing for international cooperation while it continues to search for practical local solutions to the threat posed by rising seas .
houses are being lost to the advancing sea one possible solution is to build higher artificial islands .
some 80 % of the country 's land mass is less than a metre above mean sea level , but on the island of hulumale you can actually look down on the sea from a height .
there is a natural reef protecting the island , and a lagoon between the reef and the beach .
but the whole island has been raised and reclaimed using sand , concrete and shingle , to protect it from storm surges and higher tides .
some environmental groups have concerns about the way the hulumale project was implemented , but they argue that the basic idea could provide a solution that will allow people to continue living in the maldives for hundreds of years .
" we 're proposing big islands which are built up to three metres high in seven different parts of the country , " ali rilwan from the ngo bluepeace says .
" that will be enough for the entire population of 300,000 people .
president nasheed wants the maldives to be carbon neutral " so the people who do n't want to leave , those who do n't want to become climate refugees - they can move to higher ground within the maldives . "
and then there is the country 's natural defence system - the coral reefs .
a decade ago most of the coral in the maldives was wiped out by a sudden rise in sea temperatures caused by the el nino weather phenomenon .
now small private marine research centres - many of them based at luxury resort islands - are re-growing coral and trying to understand more about its role in protecting the eco-system .
" really very little scientific research has been done , partly because there 's no university in the maldives , " says robert tomasetti , a marine biologist who works at the banyan tree resort .
" but all the sand here is formed from the corals , the shells and the algae .
without the coral there is no maldives .
instead of sea walls , the coral reefs protect the islands . "
so new reefs , higher islands and , in the future , a decarbonised economy .
but if paradise is to be preserved , much more international help will be needed - to fund further research on local solutions , and to take decisive global action against climate change .
