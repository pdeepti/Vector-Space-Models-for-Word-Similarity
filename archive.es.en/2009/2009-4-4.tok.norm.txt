europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .
" we never thought we could beat them 5-1 , " said dzeko .
" but we are still not thinking about the title .
there are still eight games to play . "
coming alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's debacle will be a hard pill to swallow for coach juergen klinsmann wolfsburg and bayern entered their showdown in joint second place on the same amount of points and an identical goal difference , and it took until shortly before half-time that the game finally came alive .
christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .
dzeko and grafite then made the difference after the break as the team of former bayern coach felix magath stormed to a stunning victory .
dzeko tapped in marcel schaefer 's left-wing cross as munich 's young defender breno made no serious challenge .
two minutes later he scored again off influential midfielder zvjezdan misimovic .
grafite then completed the rout , his first coming in the 74th and the back-heeler in the 77th the final insult as munich were hammered ahead of next week 's champions league quarter-final with barcelona .
" we have to swallow this , " said bayern coach juergen klinsmann .
" we could have taken a huge step .
we made many mistakes .
we know we played badly and must look ahead very quickly . "
hamburg carves out a 1-0 win over hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's pitroipa scored his side 's winning goal against hoffenheim hamburg 's victory came courtesy of jonathan pitroipa , who in the 28th minute squeezed past goalkeeper timo hildebrand and a defender to find the net .
the hosts had captain david jarolim sent off for a second bookable offence late in the game .
hertha 's reign on top ended when they lost their second game in a row against a determined dortmund team which drew first blood in the 25th minute from alexander frei 's left-footer .
hertha leveled after a solo from raffael in the 54th , but sebastian kehl 's header in the 63rd and nelson valdez in the 82nd sealed their fate .
" we played well and had our chances , but dortmund 's second goal decided the game , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
elsewhere , vfb stuttgart won 2-1 at vfl bochum to pass hoffenheim for fifth place , and eintracht frankfurt got a breather in the lowlands with a 2-1 victory over drop zone club energie cottbus .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .
" we never thought we could beat them 5-1 , " said dzeko .
" but we are still not thinking about the title .
there are still eight games to play . "
coming alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's debacle will be a hard pill to swallow for coach juergen klinsmann wolfsburg and bayern entered their showdown in joint second place on the same amount of points and an identical goal difference , and it took until shortly before half-time that the game finally came alive .
christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .
dzeko and grafite then made the difference after the break as the team of former bayern coach felix magath stormed to a stunning victory .
dzeko tapped in marcel schaefer 's left-wing cross as munich 's young defender breno made no serious challenge .
two minutes later he scored again off influential midfielder zvjezdan misimovic .
grafite then completed the rout , his first coming in the 74th and the back-heeler in the 77th the final insult as munich were hammered ahead of next week 's champions league quarter-final with barcelona .
" we have to swallow this , " said bayern coach juergen klinsmann .
" we could have taken a huge step .
we made many mistakes .
we know we played badly and must look ahead very quickly . "
hamburg carves out a 1-0 win over hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's pitroipa scored his side 's winning goal against hoffenheim hamburg 's victory came courtesy of jonathan pitroipa , who in the 28th minute squeezed past goalkeeper timo hildebrand and a defender to find the net .
the hosts had captain david jarolim sent off for a second bookable offence late in the game .
hertha 's reign on top ended when they lost their second game in a row against a determined dortmund team which drew first blood in the 25th minute from alexander frei 's left-footer .
hertha leveled after a solo from raffael in the 54th , but sebastian kehl 's header in the 63rd and nelson valdez in the 82nd sealed their fate .
" we played well and had our chances , but dortmund 's second goal decided the game , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
elsewhere , vfb stuttgart won 2-1 at vfl bochum to pass hoffenheim for fifth place , and eintracht frankfurt got a breather in the lowlands with a 2-1 victory over drop zone club energie cottbus .
schalke won 2-0 at arminia bielefeld on friday in the first game since the sacking of coach fred rutten , with youri mulder , mike bueskens and oliver reck in charge as an interim trio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

" that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.04.2009 denmark turns to green transport in runup to climate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , charging electric cars should be as fast as filling a gas tank denmark is a leader in climate policy , but the danes are also among the highest per capita users of energy in the world .
the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .
the us office for special investigations -lrb- osi -rrb- described sobibor as " as close an approximation of hell as has ever been created on this planet . " nt / td , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .

demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .
" we never thought we could beat them 5-1 , " said dzeko .
" but we are still not thinking about the title .
there are still eight games to play . "
coming alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's debacle will be a hard pill to swallow for coach juergen klinsmann wolfsburg and bayern entered their showdown in joint second place on the same amount of points and an identical goal difference , and it took until shortly before half-time that the game finally came alive .
christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .
dzeko and grafite then made the difference after the break as the team of former bayern coach felix magath stormed to a stunning victory .
dzeko tapped in marcel schaefer 's left-wing cross as munich 's young defender breno made no serious challenge .
two minutes later he scored again off influential midfielder zvjezdan misimovic .
grafite then completed the rout , his first coming in the 74th and the back-heeler in the 77th the final insult as munich were hammered ahead of next week 's champions league quarter-final with barcelona .
" we have to swallow this , " said bayern coach juergen klinsmann .
" we could have taken a huge step .
we made many mistakes .
we know we played badly and must look ahead very quickly . "
hamburg carves out a 1-0 win over hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's pitroipa scored his side 's winning goal against hoffenheim hamburg 's victory came courtesy of jonathan pitroipa , who in the 28th minute squeezed past goalkeeper timo hildebrand and a defender to find the net .
the hosts had captain david jarolim sent off for a second bookable offence late in the game .
hertha 's reign on top ended when they lost their second game in a row against a determined dortmund team which drew first blood in the 25th minute from alexander frei 's left-footer .
hertha leveled after a solo from raffael in the 54th , but sebastian kehl 's header in the 63rd and nelson valdez in the 82nd sealed their fate .
" we played well and had our chances , but dortmund 's second goal decided the game , " said hertha coach lucien favre .

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .
the us office for special investigations -lrb- osi -rrb- described sobibor as " as close an approximation of hell as has ever been created on this planet . " nt / td , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .

but they failed in their primary goal of blocking the motorcades carrying nato leaders . the demonstrators ' motto was a call to spend " millions on peace instead of billions on war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .
police spokesmen declined to say if officers had been staying in the 78-room hotel . hundreds of police protected french fire fighters as they fought the blaze .

but they failed in their primary goal of blocking the motorcades carrying nato leaders . the demonstrators ' motto was a call to spend " millions on peace instead of billions on war .

" afghanistan is a litmus test for us all , " said german chancellor angela merkel , one of the nato summit 's co-hosts along with french president nicolas sarkozy . merkel praised us president barack obama over his new strategy for afghanistan and said her country was ready to contribute more soldiers , trainers and money towards " the afghanistanization " of the country . sarkozy also lauded obama 's new approach to the conflict , which involves speeding up afghan reconstruction and involving other regional players such as pakistan and iran . obama and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer then formally welcomed albania and croatia into the alliance , with the us president offering leaders of the two countries a copy of nato 's 1949 founding treaty . mrm / ai / th / tt , dpa / rtr / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .
police spokesmen declined to say if officers had been staying in the 78-room hotel . hundreds of police protected french fire fighters as they fought the blaze .
french riot police , armed with clubs and shields , repeatedly fired tear-gas grenades to drive off rioters . security measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators used molotov cocktails , the police responded with teargas nato leaders were meeting in strasbourg on saturday at a summit celebrating the 60th anniversary of the alliance 's founding . some 10,000 police officers were deployed in and around the city , whose downtown districts were otherwise as deserted as a ghost town . police said 28 people were arrested early saturday as nearly 2,000 demonstrators managed to infiltrate the city , blocking tramway and bus routes .
but they failed in their primary goal of blocking the motorcades carrying nato leaders . the demonstrators ' motto was a call to spend " millions on peace instead of billions on war . " historic meeting the second day of the summit began with a formal ceremony on a bridge across the rhine river which connects the german town of kehl with strasbourg in france . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy joined the heads of state and government from the other 26 nato countries in a symbolic meeting on the occasion of france 's rejoining the alliance . bildunterschrift : the bridge between france and germany served as a symbol for nato unity after the ceremony , nato leaders began talks on how to defeat the taliban insurgency and prevent it from becoming a haven for al qaeda terrorists . " afghanistan is a litmus test for us all , " said german chancellor angela merkel , one of the nato summit 's co-hosts along with french president nicolas sarkozy . merkel praised us president barack obama over his new strategy for afghanistan and said her country was ready to contribute more soldiers , trainers and money towards " the afghanistanization " of the country . sarkozy also lauded obama 's new approach to the conflict , which involves speeding up afghan reconstruction and involving other regional players such as pakistan and iran . obama and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer then formally welcomed albania and croatia into the alliance , with the us president offering leaders of the two countries a copy of nato 's 1949 founding treaty . mrm / ai / th / tt , dpa / rtr / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .
police spokesmen declined to say if officers had been staying in the 78-room hotel . hundreds of police protected french fire fighters as they fought the blaze .
french riot police , armed with clubs and shields , repeatedly fired tear-gas grenades to drive off rioters . security measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators used molotov cocktails , the police responded with teargas nato leaders were meeting in strasbourg on saturday at a summit celebrating the 60th anniversary of the alliance 's founding . some 10,000 police officers were deployed in and around the city , whose downtown districts were otherwise as deserted as a ghost town . police said 28 people were arrested early saturday as nearly 2,000 demonstrators managed to infiltrate the city , blocking tramway and bus routes .
but they failed in their primary goal of blocking the motorcades carrying nato leaders . the demonstrators ' motto was a call to spend " millions on peace instead of billions on war . " historic meeting the second day of the summit began with a formal ceremony on a bridge across the rhine river which connects the german town of kehl with strasbourg in france . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy joined the heads of state and government from the other 26 nato countries in a symbolic meeting on the occasion of france 's rejoining the alliance . bildunterschrift : the bridge between france and germany served as a symbol for nato unity after the ceremony , nato leaders began talks on how to defeat the taliban insurgency and prevent it from becoming a haven for al qaeda terrorists . " afghanistan is a litmus test for us all , " said german chancellor angela merkel , one of the nato summit 's co-hosts along with french president nicolas sarkozy . merkel praised us president barack obama over his new strategy for afghanistan and said her country was ready to contribute more soldiers , trainers and money towards " the afghanistanization " of the country . sarkozy also lauded obama 's new approach to the conflict , which involves speeding up afghan reconstruction and involving other regional players such as pakistan and iran . obama and nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer then formally welcomed albania and croatia into the alliance , with the us president offering leaders of the two countries a copy of nato 's 1949 founding treaty . mrm / ai / th / tt , dpa / rtr / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .

as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .

there are still eight games to play . "

christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .
dzeko and grafite then made the difference after the break as the team of former bayern coach felix magath stormed to a stunning victory .
dzeko tapped in marcel schaefer 's left-wing cross as munich 's young defender breno made no serious challenge .
two minutes later he scored again off influential midfielder zvjezdan misimovic .
grafite then completed the rout , his first coming in the 74th and the back-heeler in the 77th the final insult as munich were hammered ahead of next week 's champions league quarter-final with barcelona .
" we have to swallow this , " said bayern coach juergen klinsmann .
" we could have taken a huge step .
we made many mistakes .
we know we played badly and must look ahead very quickly . "

hertha 's reign on top ended when they lost their second game in a row against a determined dortmund team which drew first blood in the 25th minute from alexander frei 's left-footer .
hertha leveled after a solo from raffael in the 54th , but sebastian kehl 's header in the 63rd and nelson valdez in the 82nd sealed their fate .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .
police spokesmen declined to say if officers had been staying in the 78-room hotel . hundreds of police protected french fire fighters as they fought the blaze .

but they failed in their primary goal of blocking the motorcades carrying nato leaders . the demonstrators ' motto was a call to spend " millions on peace instead of billions on war . " historic meeting the second day of the summit began with a formal ceremony on a bridge across the rhine river which connects the german town of kehl with strasbourg in france . german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy joined the heads of state and government from the other 26 nato countries in a symbolic meeting on the occasion of france 's rejoining the alliance . bildunterschrift : the bridge between france and germany served as a symbol for nato unity after the ceremony , nato leaders began talks on how to defeat the taliban insurgency and prevent it from becoming a haven for al qaeda terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.04.2009 denmark turns to green transport in runup to climate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , charging electric cars should be as fast as filling a gas tank denmark is a leader in climate policy , but the danes are also among the highest per capita users of energy in the world .
the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

" i will do my utmost to live up to the confidence shown to me by my colleagues , " rasmussen said shortly after being chosen as the next head of the world 's largest military alliance . rasmussen officially announced his candidacy for the position on friday and received support from the us and western european countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has openly endorsed rasmussen , saying that he will be an " excellent choice " and a " strong secretary general . " he is set to succeed jaap de hoop scheffer on august 1 . us mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's president gul had opposed the nomination us president barack obama was instrumental in ending turkish obstruction of rasmussen 's appointment , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said on saturday . erdogan told turkish television that obama had offered ankara a number of guaranties , which he did not detail . western diplomats in strasbourg agreed that the american president had on his own secured the last-gasp deal to name a successor to the outgoing nato head . " the election of rasmussen was unanimous , but there were important efforts to make sure that everybody felt included , " obama said . " and i want to thank , in particular , turkey for raising some concerns having to do with ... security issues , and their confidence that the new secretary general would address them , " the us president said . turkey had previously opposed the nato decision , with president abdullah gul criticizing rasmussen 's handling of a 2006 crisis over cartoons of the prophet muhammad that appeared in a danish newspaper . rasmussen invoked freedom of expression to defend the publication of the cartoons , which triggered outrage among muslims worldwide . high standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders are happy that turkey dropped its objections to rasmussen obama 's diplomatic success with turkey only reinforced the us president 's already high standing with his allies . obama also came away from the summit with additional help in the war in afghanistan , as allies pledged 3,000 additional troops to secure the upcoming afghan elections , $ 100 million -lrb- 75 million euros -rrb- for a fund to support the afghan army and $ 500 million for civilian reconstruction . in addition , a nato training mission was established within the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- that would comprise about 2,000 instructors for afghanistan 's army and police force . the alliance also determined to improve relations with russia as the repercussions of last summer 's invasion of georgia by moscow 's armed forces were still being felt . in its closing declaration , nato urged moscow to respect the commitments it made with respect to georgia in the deal hammered out by then european union head nicolas sarkozy , the french president . the summit officially seated croatia and albania as new members and welcomed co-host france back to nato 's military command structure after an absence of 43 years . nt / rwd / td / glb / tt , ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 04.04.2009 eu ministers propose new rules to regulate financial markets großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voracious locusts became the symbol of greedy financial markets in germany just two days after the group of 20 major world economies agreed in london to step up financial supervision , the european union has begun fleshing out an extensive overhaul of its own financial framework . within weeks , the eu hopes to propose new rules regulating hedge funds and private equity and suggest guidelines to prevent excessive risk-taking in financial markets . eu finance ministers have already proposed new rules to supervise credit rating agencies , which have been blamed for exacerbating the financial crisis by rating high-risk securities as good debt . the 27-member bloc wants the new financial oversight system to be in place by 2010 , according to joaquin almunia , the eu currency commissioner . german finance minister peer steinbrueck , however , said he doubted that this very ambitious timetable could be kept . in light of the severity of the crisis , almunia said the eu would have to accelerate its efforts . eu looking for norms in line with new us rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in frankfurt protested against using taxpayer money to fix financial markets in prague , eu finance ministers agreed to follow suggestions made by former imf boss , jacques de larosiere as the basis for the new regulatory system .
larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .
up to 30,000 people are expected to show up for obama 's speech in prague 's historic castle square . gb / tt , dpa / ape / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .
" we never thought we could beat them 5-1 , " said dzeko .
" but we are still not thinking about the title .
there are still eight games to play . "
coming alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's debacle will be a hard pill to swallow for coach juergen klinsmann wolfsburg and bayern entered their showdown in joint second place on the same amount of points and an identical goal difference , and it took until shortly before half-time that the game finally came alive .
christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

fire also gutted a nearby tourist information office and a disused french customs post . it was not immediately known if there were any casualties . one french police officer claimed the hotel was attacked in the belief that it was being used to accommodate out-of-town police . " it 's no coincidence , " he said bitterly .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.04.2009 denmark turns to green transport in runup to climate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , charging electric cars should be as fast as filling a gas tank denmark is a leader in climate policy , but the danes are also among the highest per capita users of energy in the world .
the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .
the us office for special investigations -lrb- osi -rrb- described sobibor as " as close an approximation of hell as has ever been created on this planet . " nt / td , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

" i will do my utmost to live up to the confidence shown to me by my colleagues , " rasmussen said shortly after being chosen as the next head of the world 's largest military alliance . rasmussen officially announced his candidacy for the position on friday and received support from the us and western european countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has openly endorsed rasmussen , saying that he will be an " excellent choice " and a " strong secretary general . " he is set to succeed jaap de hoop scheffer on august 1 . us mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's president gul had opposed the nomination us president barack obama was instrumental in ending turkish obstruction of rasmussen 's appointment , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said on saturday . erdogan told turkish television that obama had offered ankara a number of guaranties , which he did not detail . western diplomats in strasbourg agreed that the american president had on his own secured the last-gasp deal to name a successor to the outgoing nato head .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices .

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .
demjanjuk was sentenced to death in 1988 in an israeli court , but the sentence was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court .
demjanjuk denies guilt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has said it will deport demjanjuk last month the us administration finalized plans to deport john demjanjuk to germany to face charges that he was complicit in the murder at least 29,000 jewish people as a nazi death camp guard .
germany issued an arrest warrant for the ukrainian-born demjanjuk , the culmination of years of legal proceedings that have attempted to link the retired auto worker with wwii atrocities .
demjanjuk denies any involvement in war crimes .
he has said he was in the soviet army and a prisoner of war in 1942 before resettling in the united states after the war .
munich prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk , accusing the retired autoworker of being an accessory in the killings of thousands of jews between march and september 1943 .
demjanjuk 's defense counsel filed an appeal thursday to avoid extradition to germany , arguing the move would be tantamount to torture .
legal battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk continues to fight plans to deport him to germany in washington , the us department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- said it " is working closely with the government of germany to secure demjanjuk 's removal from the united states , " according to spokeswoman laura sweeney .
in 2008 the simon wiesenthal center ranked demjanjuk number two on its " most wanted " nazi criminal list , behind aribert heim , nicknamed " doctor death , " who according to a recent investigation died in 1992 .
german prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for demjanjuk in march , accusing him of serving for six months in 1943 at the sobibor death camp in poland .
the us office for special investigations -lrb- osi -rrb- described sobibor as " as close an approximation of hell as has ever been created on this planet . " nt / td , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "

more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .

it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

wolfsburg lead the standings on goal difference with their eighth straight victory with hertha berlin crashing 3-1 at home against borussia dortmund .
wolfsburg lead the way with 51 points , due to a superior goal difference over northern german rivals hamburg who defeated slumping hoffenheim 1-0 .
hertha are third on 49 points and bayern fourth with 48 points after their biggest defeat in seven years since an identical 5-1 drubbing against schalke in 2002 .
" we never thought we could beat them 5-1 , " said dzeko .
" but we are still not thinking about the title .
there are still eight games to play . "
coming alive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's debacle will be a hard pill to swallow for coach juergen klinsmann wolfsburg and bayern entered their showdown in joint second place on the same amount of points and an identical goal difference , and it took until shortly before half-time that the game finally came alive .
christian gentner headed the hosts 1-0 up off a corner kick in the 44th .
but munich 's luca toni , back from a five-week injury layoff , got the equalizer a minute later , with wolfsburg 's goalkeeper diego benaglio ruled to have stopped the shot behind the goal line .
dzeko and grafite then made the difference after the break as the team of former bayern coach felix magath stormed to a stunning victory .
dzeko tapped in marcel schaefer 's left-wing cross as munich 's young defender breno made no serious challenge .
two minutes later he scored again off influential midfielder zvjezdan misimovic .
grafite then completed the rout , his first coming in the 74th and the back-heeler in the 77th the final insult as munich were hammered ahead of next week 's champions league quarter-final with barcelona .
" we have to swallow this , " said bayern coach juergen klinsmann .
" we could have taken a huge step .
we made many mistakes .
we know we played badly and must look ahead very quickly . "
hamburg carves out a 1-0 win over hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's pitroipa scored his side 's winning goal against hoffenheim hamburg 's victory came courtesy of jonathan pitroipa , who in the 28th minute squeezed past goalkeeper timo hildebrand and a defender to find the net .
the hosts had captain david jarolim sent off for a second bookable offence late in the game .
hertha 's reign on top ended when they lost their second game in a row against a determined dortmund team which drew first blood in the 25th minute from alexander frei 's left-footer .
hertha leveled after a solo from raffael in the 54th , but sebastian kehl 's header in the 63rd and nelson valdez in the 82nd sealed their fate .
" we played well and had our chances , but dortmund 's second goal decided the game , " said hertha coach lucien favre .
elsewhere , vfb stuttgart won 2-1 at vfl bochum to pass hoffenheim for fifth place , and eintracht frankfurt got a breather in the lowlands with a 2-1 victory over drop zone club energie cottbus .
schalke won 2-0 at arminia bielefeld on friday in the first game since the sacking of coach fred rutten , with youri mulder , mike bueskens and oliver reck in charge as an interim trio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 04.04.2009 denmark turns to green transport in runup to climate summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the future , charging electric cars should be as fast as filling a gas tank denmark is a leader in climate policy , but the danes are also among the highest per capita users of energy in the world .
the government in copenhagen is now trying to change that . when danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen came to power in 2001 , he did n't seem at all interested in the environment and climate protection . but with every dane pumping out 5 tons of co2 into the atmosphere each year , copenhagen could find itself in a tricky position as the host of a giant climate summit at the end of this year , when delegates from all over the world get together to set new global targets on emissions ahead of the 2012 expiry of the kyoto agreement . that 's why today a different message is heard coming from copenhagen and the vision of green economic growth is sprinkled throughout just about every speech rasmussen gives . the prime minister is now openly advocating " a society in which we are completely independent from fossil fuels like coal , oil and gas " and a future in which renewable wind , solar and biomass energy sources will make it possible to live in " houses that produce more energy than they use . " a few milestones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark is a leader in offshore wind energy denmark has , indeed , reached a few important milestones over the past decades .
back in the 1980s , it decided against building nuclear reactors , and today it gets almost 30 percent of its electricity from wind turbines .
the nation 's power plants are also leaders in terms of energy efficiency . and while denmark has made great strides in developing alternative energy resources , its transportation sector is still a major problem . " our achilles heel is the transportation sector , which continues to grow and grow , " said climate and energy minister connie hedegaard . the danish government has recently put forward an ambitious action to use green taxes to help out companies developing electric cars and bio fuels .
it has also decided to put two thirds of all state investments in the transport sector into public transportations . " that 's a real step the danish government is taking to sustainably reduce the co2 levels of the transportation sector , " hedegaard said . electric cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish power plants are taking energy efficiency to a new level currently there are only about 200 climate-friendly autos on the nation 's streets , but that should grow to 100,000 within two years . the danish energy corporation dong and the american company better place are planning to invest 100 million euros -lrb- $ 135 million -rrb- to build up infrastructure in the country for electric cars .
the idea is to make it just as fast to charge up a battery as it is to fill up a tank of gas . the head of the danish electric auto association , per moeller , is very pleased with that plan , and confident that denmark can become a pioneer in this sector . " we have really good conditions for it here : no extreme climate changes and a flat landscape , " he said .
" denmark is certainly one of the countries in which it would be the easiest to introduce electric cars . " the batteries to run these cars of the future have another advantage .
they can be charged during the night when energy from wind turbines is available but is n't being used much , essentially turning them into important energy storage devices . " i do n't think we can leave it to the politicians to solve the problems with climate change , " said jens moberg , ceo of the danish branch of better place .
" consumers and companies need to take an active role in the process . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .
these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "

these days , both the imf and world bank hold negotiations with the governments to assess what is needed and whether the country in question qualifies for the loan or grant they are applying for .
institutionalized problems however , according to both duncan and shikwati , due to the minimal influence african nations have over these organizations , there are still unaddressed , institutionalized problems within both the imf and world bank which promote a western-orientated focus .
this is something meetings such as the g20 summit and doha trade talks should discuss .
" the world bank and the imf have been very clear on the fact that they support countries that adopt market liberalization , " shikwati says .
" on the surface , the term ' market liberalization ' is an innocent term and an ideal that the world ought to go for .
the fact of the matter however is that , whereas african countries get lectured on open market systems , these institutions have in place a planned global market economic system that relegates africa to producers of labor and raw materials . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say the institutions have a western bias " there is still an ideological bias towards western neo-conservative liberalization in the reforms that are asked for by the bank when loans are being offered , " duncan says .
" this is one of the main problems with what a number of people see as the strategy of both the institutions where the direction and priorities are potentially beneficial to the west . "
todd moss , of the emerging africa project , rejects the idea of a western bias but concedes that international financial institutions " skew their assistance to countries that follow sound economic policies , as those institutions define them and which are set by the board and management . "
economists are skeptical whether more african influence in the world bank and imf would actually make a difference and improve the distribution of development funds and grants .
allan duncan believes that even if the level of influence is improved , barriers further down the chain would still prevent africa 's development .
more than african influence needed " on the face of it , increasing african involvement in the decision making and policy development within both institutions should lead to improved allocation of resources within the various projects that both institutions carry out , " he says .
" this unfortunately is based on the idea that african leaders both know and care about the development and well-being of their populations which , from the various examples from nigeria , kenya and zimbabwe , show that the imperatives of the political classes and the needs and aspirations of the citizens do not necessarily go together . "
james shikwati of the nairobi ngo , advocates more dramatic action to increase african influence : removing the world bank and imf from the equation entirely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe africa should be allowed to help itself " africa needs to divorce itself from the world bank and the imf if it is to make any significant strides in development that will uplift productivity of their own people , " he says .
" the point then is not to influence these institutions , because they work under the direction of their major shareholders .
it will be expecting too much for these institutions which have for close to 70 years perpetuated policies that keep africans as providers of labor and raw materials to suddenly have a change of heart .
african needs a new global economic dispensation .
" if africa succeeds in getting rid of the world bank / imf role as planners of global market economy , it will lead to increased productivity on the continent and increased market access globally of african goods , " he adds .
" under the prevailing economic scenario , the world bank and imf push african countries to open their markets while allowing their shareholders to engage in both subtle and explicit protectionism that prevent migration ; access to wealthy country markets and limiting productivity by planning and dictating policies to african countries .
" one has to recognize that under the current economic order , africa is not part of the global economic architecture ; it simply follows dictates of wealthy nations and international agencies supervised by the world bank and imf , " shikwati concluded .
successes offset by financial burdens while allan duncan , the development finance expert , does n't go as far as supporting the idea of ' divorcing ' africa from the imf and world bank , he suggests that the institutions ' successes are offset by the burdens arising from their influence that africa has to shoulder , which in turn hinders the continent 's development .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes development aid comes with a high price " i think a number of people within the ngo community would seriously question the value of the interventions of both the institutions ' work within africa , stating that their intervention is inappropriate and they leave countries with large unsustainable debt burdens , " he says .
" they do tend to do large scale infrastructure projects within africa and elsewhere , such as roads , dams etc , which can lead to improvements in economic activity through improving market access , " he adds .
" however , these tend to be poorly maintained , if maintained at all , and service minor areas of countries that are desperately in need of basic service provisions such as health care , education or security .
so although they can service the aspirations of the recipient country in terms of prestige they may not necessarily be what the county actually needs or should be prioritizing for the investment that is undertaken . "
if and when the balance in decision-making at the world bank and imf is discussed at a global level , it is obvious that many other complicated and interdependent factors will have to be taken into account before africa has an influential say in its developmental future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 04.04.2009 experts say africa has minimal influence over own development , destiny großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts question the role of the imf and world bank in africa the g20 leaders who met in london this week to discuss the global economic crisis made sure that enough was said about africa to appease those who had called for the world ’ s financial powers not to forget the continent . but while promises were made to secure development aid and pursue a new global trade deal which would , in theory , create a fairer system , the g20 summit , like many meetings before it , failed to address the balance in the decision-making processes in international financial institutions -lrb- ifis -rrb- such as the world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
many experts believe that african influence in world bank and imf decisions which affect the continent is currently minimal despite a number of africans holding prominent positions in those institutions .
" i highly doubt that we have any influential african people that help determine african policies at the imf and world bank , " economist james shikwati , director of the inter region economic network -lrb- iren -rrb- a nairobi-based non-governmental organization -lrb- ngo -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" however , we do have influential african people , who by virtue of the offices they hold , help implement imf / world bank policies in africa .
and these are african heads of state , finance ministers and central bank governors . "
development finance expert allan duncan , an economist working in east africa , agrees .
" next to nothing actually goes on with african leaders and the world bank , " he told deutsche welle .
" the decision-making within the bank and the imf is based on the size of contributions they receive , so countries like the united states and britain have a large say in the policies and direction of the bank and imf policy development , whereas the african countries are only recipients . "
todd moss , a senior fellow and director of the emerging africa project at the center for global development , a washington-based ngo , says that a number of high profile positions in the ifis are held by africans but concedes that ultimately the decision makers are the national governments themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africans hold top positions but ultimate influence is minimal " the policies of the ifis are set by the board and its management , " he says .
" africans hold a few seats on each board , plus there are many africans in the high levels of the imf & world bank management . liberian antoinette sayeh is the head of the imf africa department , the africa vice president at the world bank is nigerian obiageli ezekwesili , and the managing director , effectively the number two at the bank , is ngozi okonjo-iweala .
but the governments themselves ultimately decide what policies they pursue .
the world bank and imf can nudge them in a certain direction , but they rarely have leverage to force anything . " despite the minimal influence at these ifis , african countries have seen some progress in recent years in the way they receive development money from the world bank and the imf .
there is no longer the " one size fits all " approach of the 1970s and 1980s where loans or grants were just forced down the throats of developing nations without specific grants and loans tailored to individual requirements .

" i will do my utmost to live up to the confidence shown to me by my colleagues , " rasmussen said shortly after being chosen as the next head of the world 's largest military alliance . rasmussen officially announced his candidacy for the position on friday and received support from the us and western european countries .
german chancellor angela merkel has openly endorsed rasmussen , saying that he will be an " excellent choice " and a " strong secretary general . " he is set to succeed jaap de hoop scheffer on august 1 . us mediation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's president gul had opposed the nomination us president barack obama was instrumental in ending turkish obstruction of rasmussen 's appointment , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said on saturday . erdogan told turkish television that obama had offered ankara a number of guaranties , which he did not detail . western diplomats in strasbourg agreed that the american president had on his own secured the last-gasp deal to name a successor to the outgoing nato head . " the election of rasmussen was unanimous , but there were important efforts to make sure that everybody felt included , " obama said . " and i want to thank , in particular , turkey for raising some concerns having to do with ... security issues , and their confidence that the new secretary general would address them , " the us president said . turkey had previously opposed the nato decision , with president abdullah gul criticizing rasmussen 's handling of a 2006 crisis over cartoons of the prophet muhammad that appeared in a danish newspaper . rasmussen invoked freedom of expression to defend the publication of the cartoons , which triggered outrage among muslims worldwide . high standing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato leaders are happy that turkey dropped its objections to rasmussen obama 's diplomatic success with turkey only reinforced the us president 's already high standing with his allies . obama also came away from the summit with additional help in the war in afghanistan , as allies pledged 3,000 additional troops to secure the upcoming afghan elections , $ 100 million -lrb- 75 million euros -rrb- for a fund to support the afghan army and $ 500 million for civilian reconstruction . in addition , a nato training mission was established within the international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- that would comprise about 2,000 instructors for afghanistan 's army and police force . the alliance also determined to improve relations with russia as the repercussions of last summer 's invasion of georgia by moscow 's armed forces were still being felt . in its closing declaration , nato urged moscow to respect the commitments it made with respect to georgia in the deal hammered out by then european union head nicolas sarkozy , the french president . the summit officially seated croatia and albania as new members and welcomed co-host france back to nato 's military command structure after an absence of 43 years . nt / rwd / td / glb / tt , ap / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

john demjanjuk was expected to be extradited to germany by monday .
the immigration judge granted the motion for the stay of extradition until the question of whether the case against demjanjuk should be reopened is decided .
eighty-nine year-old demjanjuk was acquitted in 1993 by the israeli supreme court of charges that he worked at the infamous treblinka death camp , after former guards identified another man as " ivan the terrible . "
germany , however , now suspects him of working as a nazi guard at the sobibor concentration camp , in occupied poland , where thousands of jews were put to death in 1943 .
munich prosecutors issued a warrant three weeks ago for the arrest of the ukrainian-born man , who has been stripped of his us citizenship and is now officially stateless .

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

europe has criticized the law , saying it 's worse than when the taliban ruled the country . a new law signed by afghanistan 's president hamid karzai requires shiite women to ask permission from their husbands before leaving the house and to respond to their request for sex .
the law has caused outrage around the world .
guenter nooke , germany 's federal commissioner for human rights policy and humanitarian aid told spiegel online in an interview published saturday that the afghan government , with this law , breaks promises it has made to the international community over protection of human rights .
media reports said that the law , which has not yet been published , bans shiite women from seeking work , getting an education or making a doctor 's appointment without their husband 's permission .
as many as an estimated 25 percent of afghans are shiite muslims .
in addition , the law reportedly also mandates that only fathers and grandfathers can be granted child custody .
according to the dpa news agency , other opponents of the legislation have described it as " worse than during the taliban . "
critics accused karzai of pandering to crucial shiite swing voters for the upcoming presidential poll , which is scheduled for august .
asked about the law earlier this week , us secretary of state hillary clinton said , " women 's rights are a central part of american foreign policy in the obama administration . ...

larosiere has proposed not having a real eu oversight agency , but rather a system of networked national oversight boards for banking , insurance and securities . the eu finance ministers also urged their governments to relax accounting norms across europe in line with recent us moves to give banks more breathing room to deal with their toxic assets . under pressure from the us congress , the us financial accounting standards board -lrb- fasb -rrb- has voted to modify the valuation of bad securities .
previous rules called for valuations at market prices , but the changes will now allow banks to hold some toxic assets longer to avoid marking prices down to current depressed market levels . the eu ministers said that bringing the international accounting standards used in europe in line with us rules was necessary to avoid the emergence of competitive distortions . obama in prague bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after meeting nato leaders , obama is expected in prague for talks with the eu these moves of convergence with the united states stand in marked contrast to the criticisms of outgoing czech prime minister mirek topolanek , who is a virulent critic of us economic recovery efforts and has called washington 's stimulus plans " the road to hell . "
topolanek will be hosting us president barack obama at sunday 's eu summit in prague . at the same time , topolanek is expected to urge obama to persevere with a controversial missile defense shield project in poland and the czech republic that has irked the russians and divided many members of the european union . but the nuts and bolts of economic recovery may take a back seat on sunday when obama delivers an eagerly awaited speech on nuclear non-proliferation and plans to reduce nuclear arsenals .

he stayed there for the next five years before flying to chile in 2005 , where he was arrested .

" we are very much looking forward to what should be a great night out in cardiff for the fans , " he added .
however , the train companies say they will struggle to cope with an estimated finish time of around 2200 bst .
first great western spokesman , john pockett , said the company will be raising the issue with the wru and the millennium stadium 's management .
" we are disappointed that the wru have agreed to the late timing of this fixture , " he said .
" holding a rugby fixture so late on a friday night in the centre of cardiff has no regard for the transport requirements of the tens of thousands of spectators in the stadium and other supporters who will be watching the game in cardiff 's bars and pubs .
" with a finishing time of approaching 10pm this will put an extra strain on the services at cardiff central station . "
' safe service ' arriva trains wales head of stations peter northcott said the company has not objected to the millennium stadium organisers .
but he said the company was concerned about some of the potential problems of safely transporting thousands of fans at such a late hour .
" we feel that public transport provision and the effect it may have on fans who wish to travel home after the match needs further consideration , " he said .
" providing a safe and effective service for spectators before and after the match is our number one priority and we will be consulting with stakeholders and rail colleagues about how this can be achieved and if we can do so we will . "
in a statement , the wru said : " we have maintained a dialogue with arriva trains with regards the issue of evening events at the millennium stadium in cardiff .
" it is now common place for the millennium stadium and other stadia around the uk to host evening events of various kinds throughout the year .
" we fully understand that there are difficulties associated with evening concerts and sporting occasions but we are confident that they can be resolved so that cities like cardiff and the surrounding areas can reap the rewards of the commercial benefits associated with these occasions . "
