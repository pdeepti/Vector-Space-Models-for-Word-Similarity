lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .

both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .

mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.12.2009 the best and worst xis of the 2009/10 season so far back to first page back 2/2 worst xi : defense solid as a sponge , the worst xi team is built on the shifting sands of the defensive unit which features jens lehmann in goal , with andreas wolf , edson braafheid , sascha riether and marcel maltritz across the back .
lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .

so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .

the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .

" it is already disappearing when it is transported , when it is rotting and when it does n't meet european standards .
on top of this , in many countries in europe , one third of the food that consumers buy is thrown away and 50 percent of that is thrown away without even being opened . " add europe 's waste to that of the united states and the food waste problem becomes even larger .
around 40 percent of all food manufactured and put on sale in the united states is wasted , and studies show this trend is increasing .
food waste - including waste from farms , manufacturers , retailers and consumers - has risen 50 percent since 1974 , reaching about 150 trillion calories per year in 2003 . supermarkets sweeps food to trash a fascination with super and hypermarkets are partly to blame for the west 's food waste , according to harjula .

" here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .
the best coaches have a plan b , even a c. for the record : jefferson 's best xi : adler , boateng , bordon , hyypia , badstuber - ze roberto , misimovic , özil , ivanschitz - kiessling , barrios .

freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .
the best coaches have a plan b , even a c. for the record : jefferson 's best xi : adler , boateng , bordon , hyypia , badstuber - ze roberto , misimovic , özil , ivanschitz - kiessling , barrios .

the holiday season seems to provide everyone with an excuse to eat and drink to excess .
supermarkets burst with sweet treats and a mind-boggling selection of festive fare . while most of it will be ingested , more than a third of food in europe and the united states will grow moldy fur in the back of the fridge , pass its use-by date and land in garbage . huge food waste problem developing in europe in the united kingdom , one of europe 's worst food waste offenders , around 6.7 million tons of purchased and edible food , worth £ 10.2 billion -lrb- 11.2 billion euros , $ 16.6 billion -rrb- , are annually discarded .
around 4.1 million tons of this wasted food comes directly from food manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the food produced in europe is thrown away " only 30 to 40 percent of produced in europe ends up at your table , " henrik harjula , the principal administrator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it is already disappearing when it is transported , when it is rotting and when it does n't meet european standards .
on top of this , in many countries in europe , one third of the food that consumers buy is thrown away and 50 percent of that is thrown away without even being opened . " add europe 's waste to that of the united states and the food waste problem becomes even larger .
around 40 percent of all food manufactured and put on sale in the united states is wasted , and studies show this trend is increasing .
food waste - including waste from farms , manufacturers , retailers and consumers - has risen 50 percent since 1974 , reaching about 150 trillion calories per year in 2003 . supermarkets sweeps food to trash a fascination with super and hypermarkets are partly to blame for the west 's food waste , according to harjula . " people tend to go to these supermarkets once or twice a month but how can you accurately evaluate how much you a going to consume ? " he asked .
" they ca n't tell so they buy extra .
of course , this suggests that consumers are to blame too but there is this trend across europe of ' buy one , get one free ' so people are buying a lot of food that they do n't need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in the developing world ca n't compete in the market the statistics relating to food waste sit uncomfortably with the continued reports of global food shortages and food price spikes .
while there are other factors sharing the blame for a global food shortage , including the high cost of oil , a growing population , poor harvests and diverting grains to use for bio-fuels , food waste contributes to the problem . " a lot of the food and agriculture in europe and the west is subsidized and this is a huge problem for producers in the developing world , " harjula said .
" their products are not competitive on these markets and as a result they can not sell their products , which leads to farmers losing income , losing their land and the poverty and hardship which comes from that . " food waste causing an environmental stink in addition to its effect on food supply in the developing world , landfills full of food are also detrimental to the environment . " here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots . " there are ways of collecting this gas from the decomposing food and using it for energy purposes but it is not a widespread practice at the moment , " harjula said .
" what must be done in the meantime is to find away of taking the organic material out of landfill refuse . " until there are more efficient means of harnessing methane , it 's important to keep food out of landfills , according to tom macmillan , executive director of the british food ethics council . " food waste is harmful and unfair , and it is essential to stop food going into landfill , " he told deutsche welle .
" now is the moment all parties should be searching out ways to define prosperity that get away from runaway consumption .
until they succeed , chucking out less food wo n't make our lifestyles more sustainable . " slow progress taken towards solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers can help by planning their shopping better european countries are already taking steps to reduce the production of methane from food waste deposited in landfill sites , harjula said .
the enforcement of the eu 's landfill directive is expected to reduce the amount of organic material in landfill sites to 35 percent by 2016 , but a number of european nations , including germany , the netherlands and switzerland , have already reduced their levels to 5 percent and in some cases even less . experts believe that much of the responsibility for reducing food waste rests with the manufacturers .
the food industry must find ways to reduce waste throughout the production and supply chain , and find ways to redistribute finished food products and reuse by-products of the production process . consumers of course can also do their bit .
by planning before shopping for food , consumers can reduce their food waste output at point-of-purchase and in their homes , while adhering to efficient food storage ideas can the amount of food which becomes inedible quickly and then thrown away . author : nick amies editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .
the best coaches have a plan b , even a c. for the record : jefferson 's best xi : adler , boateng , bordon , hyypia , badstuber - ze roberto , misimovic , özil , ivanschitz - kiessling , barrios .
jefferson 's worst xi : lehmann , braafheid , andreas wolf , barzagli , mavraj - maniche , podolski , moreno , hitzlsperger - klose , mintal .
paul 's best xi : adler , castro , hyypia , naldo , beck – kroos , sahin , ze roberto , özil – kiessling , kuranyi paul 's worst xi : lehmann , riether , maltritz , wolf – schaefer , maniche , teber , kacar , dabrowski – grafite , sestak nick 's best xi : adler , bordon , boateng , naldo , hyypia , - kroos , ze roberto , özil , müller - kiessling , barrios nick 's worst xi : lehmann , wolf , braafheid , riether , maltritz – maniche , podolski hitzlsperger , freier – klose , raffael .

worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .

the holiday season seems to provide everyone with an excuse to eat and drink to excess .
supermarkets burst with sweet treats and a mind-boggling selection of festive fare . while most of it will be ingested , more than a third of food in europe and the united states will grow moldy fur in the back of the fridge , pass its use-by date and land in garbage . huge food waste problem developing in europe in the united kingdom , one of europe 's worst food waste offenders , around 6.7 million tons of purchased and edible food , worth £ 10.2 billion -lrb- 11.2 billion euros , $ 16.6 billion -rrb- , are annually discarded .
around 4.1 million tons of this wasted food comes directly from food manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the food produced in europe is thrown away " only 30 to 40 percent of produced in europe ends up at your table , " henrik harjula , the principal administrator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it is already disappearing when it is transported , when it is rotting and when it does n't meet european standards .
on top of this , in many countries in europe , one third of the food that consumers buy is thrown away and 50 percent of that is thrown away without even being opened . " add europe 's waste to that of the united states and the food waste problem becomes even larger .
around 40 percent of all food manufactured and put on sale in the united states is wasted , and studies show this trend is increasing .
food waste - including waste from farms , manufacturers , retailers and consumers - has risen 50 percent since 1974 , reaching about 150 trillion calories per year in 2003 . supermarkets sweeps food to trash a fascination with super and hypermarkets are partly to blame for the west 's food waste , according to harjula . " people tend to go to these supermarkets once or twice a month but how can you accurately evaluate how much you a going to consume ? " he asked .
" they ca n't tell so they buy extra .
of course , this suggests that consumers are to blame too but there is this trend across europe of ' buy one , get one free ' so people are buying a lot of food that they do n't need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in the developing world ca n't compete in the market the statistics relating to food waste sit uncomfortably with the continued reports of global food shortages and food price spikes .
while there are other factors sharing the blame for a global food shortage , including the high cost of oil , a growing population , poor harvests and diverting grains to use for bio-fuels , food waste contributes to the problem . " a lot of the food and agriculture in europe and the west is subsidized and this is a huge problem for producers in the developing world , " harjula said .
" their products are not competitive on these markets and as a result they can not sell their products , which leads to farmers losing income , losing their land and the poverty and hardship which comes from that . " food waste causing an environmental stink in addition to its effect on food supply in the developing world , landfills full of food are also detrimental to the environment . " here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots . " there are ways of collecting this gas from the decomposing food and using it for energy purposes but it is not a widespread practice at the moment , " harjula said .
" what must be done in the meantime is to find away of taking the organic material out of landfill refuse . " until there are more efficient means of harnessing methane , it 's important to keep food out of landfills , according to tom macmillan , executive director of the british food ethics council . " food waste is harmful and unfair , and it is essential to stop food going into landfill , " he told deutsche welle .
" now is the moment all parties should be searching out ways to define prosperity that get away from runaway consumption .
until they succeed , chucking out less food wo n't make our lifestyles more sustainable . " slow progress taken towards solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers can help by planning their shopping better european countries are already taking steps to reduce the production of methane from food waste deposited in landfill sites , harjula said .
the enforcement of the eu 's landfill directive is expected to reduce the amount of organic material in landfill sites to 35 percent by 2016 , but a number of european nations , including germany , the netherlands and switzerland , have already reduced their levels to 5 percent and in some cases even less . experts believe that much of the responsibility for reducing food waste rests with the manufacturers .
the food industry must find ways to reduce waste throughout the production and supply chain , and find ways to redistribute finished food products and reuse by-products of the production process . consumers of course can also do their bit .
by planning before shopping for food , consumers can reduce their food waste output at point-of-purchase and in their homes , while adhering to efficient food storage ideas can the amount of food which becomes inedible quickly and then thrown away . author : nick amies editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 53 year old was tried for subversion earlier this week . he had co-authored a manifesto that calls for political reforms in the people ’ s republic .
liu was sentenced harshly despite calls from the west and international rights groups for his unconditional release .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .

both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .
the best coaches have a plan b , even a c. for the record : jefferson 's best xi : adler , boateng , bordon , hyypia , badstuber - ze roberto , misimovic , özil , ivanschitz - kiessling , barrios .
jefferson 's worst xi : lehmann , braafheid , andreas wolf , barzagli , mavraj - maniche , podolski , moreno , hitzlsperger - klose , mintal .

the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .

another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.12.2009 the best and worst xis of the 2009/10 season so far back to first page back 2/2 worst xi : defense solid as a sponge , the worst xi team is built on the shifting sands of the defensive unit which features jens lehmann in goal , with andreas wolf , edson braafheid , sascha riether and marcel maltritz across the back .
lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .

this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

auxiliary bishops of dublin eamonn walsh and raymond field issued a statement that they had informed the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , that they would leave their positions .
four bishops have now resigned after a report released last month by the dublin archdiocese found that roman catholic authorities concealed child abuse by priests for three decades .
" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .
reputation of church placed ahead of children it was reported that more than 300 children were sexually abused by priests between 1975 and 2004 .
however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "
pressure still remains on other senior clergymen to quit over the scandal. mk / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .
nationalists in serbia oppose the arrests as they consider mladic a wartime hero. rb / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 25.12.2009 the best and worst xis of the 2009/10 season so far back to first page back 2/2 worst xi : defense solid as a sponge , the worst xi team is built on the shifting sands of the defensive unit which features jens lehmann in goal , with andreas wolf , edson braafheid , sascha riether and marcel maltritz across the back .
lehmann has proved yet again that while his record shows that he can actually be a goalkeeper when he wants to be , most of the time he would much rather be a five-year-old child .
unpredictability can sometimes give a goalie an edge but in lehmann 's case it has pushed him over that edge and into the abyss .
while not 100 percent to blame for stuttgart 's imploding season , answers as to where the other five percent came from can be sent in on a postcard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum 's maltritz -lrb- blue -rrb- again just fails to prevent a goal it 's hard to pick out the weakest link from nuremberg 's wolf , bayern 's braafheid , wolfsburg 's riether and bochum 's maltritz .
all have shown inadequacies and failings to meet the criteria and their ineptitudes are so closely tied on the embarrassment scale that separating them and handing them the title is almost impossible .
which is why the award for most ineffectual defender goes to the eight-legged gaff machine known as wolfbraafheidriethermaltritz .
worst xi : midfield the spine of the worst xi looks more than a little rubbery and the likes of maniche , caio , paul freier and thomas hitzlsperger combined look unlikely to stiffen and offer any resistance when opposing a more adventurous and creative quartet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maniche -lrb- r . -rrb- has labored dreadfully in cologne 's midfield maniche has contributed nothing to fc cologne 's season to date .
a highly decorated player with league titles in portugal and italy and europa league and champions league winners ' medals , it seemed as though cologne were getting a hugely experienced midfield general when he joined from inter milan .
what they apparently got was a disinterested donkey looking for a quiet pasture to spend his remaining days .
at least cologne did n't buy caio or they would have been in bigger trouble .
the most expensive player in eintracht frankfurt 's history , caio is one of a rare breed – a brazilian playmaker who ca n't make plays .
buying expensively from foreign markets is always a risk which is why vfl bochum thought they were playing safe buying the experienced paul freier .
freier , who began his professional career at bochum before enjoying more success at bayer leverkusen , is hardly an unknown quantity at the ruhrstadion but the paul freier of 2009 may as well be a stranger or the evil twin of the original .
legs and motivation seem to have been misplaced on the short journey between his last two clubs .
making up the quartet is thomas hitzlsperger , another player who seems to have lost his mojo .
the midfielder formerly known as the hammer is currently trying out new nicknames such as the chocolate teapot -lrb- as in ' as useful as a … ' -rrb- and that bloke who used to be good .
gone are the explosive shots , the commanding presence and the ability to kick a ball straight .
worst xi : attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose has been declining since joining bayern munich leading the non-firing line of the worst xi are miroslav klose and marek mintal .
both former bundesliga top scorers are having nightmare seasons so far .
bayern 's klose has been creaking and stumbling around as a shadow of his former self – and that 's just on the way from the dressing room to the bench .
when he does eventually get a game , he has looked off the pace and profligate in front of the sticks .
when he has notched a goal , he seems to be celebrating out of relief , a fact that only compounds the belief that he 's in decline .
mintal does n't have the excuse that he 's slipping down the pecking order at his club behind a host of international strikers and world class players .
he plays for nuremberg after all .
the midfielder-cum-non-striking-striker has managed just one goal so far this season as nuremberg become mired in an early relegation battle .
mintal has yet to show any signs that he has the stomach for another fight .
worst xi : coach look , there are a number of reasons to feel sorry for how things went for markus babbel in this foreshortened half-season at the helm in stuttgart . the club sold his best player in mario gomez and bought poorly , bringing in the out-of-sorts pavel pogrebnyak and the thus-far woeful aliaksandr hleb .
the dfb 's ruling that he had to get his coaching badges in order meant he spent as much time on the road or in cologne in the classroom as at the stuttgart training ground .
the way he accepted his sacking was astonishingly gracious – appearing at a press conference with his executioner horst heldt and reminding the club 's unruly fans that this was not a life-or-death issue , especially in light of what german football had gone through with robert enke 's suicide .
yes , markus babbel is a class act , and will probably be a good coach in the future .
but none of this means he did a good job coaching stuttgart this year . his initial self-assurance that he could handle coaching classes and actual coaching evaporated when the going got tough , and he 'd quit the course by mid-october . in addition to a nearly-intact roster from last year , a number of promising youngsters like sebastian rudy and timo gebhart have come through , adding to his choice in midfield . and in the end , babbel had a whole summer to devise a new way of playing without gomez , the former tip of his spear . whatever he came up with was n't working .
the best coaches have a plan b , even a c. for the record : jefferson 's best xi : adler , boateng , bordon , hyypia , badstuber - ze roberto , misimovic , özil , ivanschitz - kiessling , barrios .
jefferson 's worst xi : lehmann , braafheid , andreas wolf , barzagli , mavraj - maniche , podolski , moreno , hitzlsperger - klose , mintal .
paul 's best xi : adler , castro , hyypia , naldo , beck – kroos , sahin , ze roberto , özil – kiessling , kuranyi paul 's worst xi : lehmann , riether , maltritz , wolf – schaefer , maniche , teber , kacar , dabrowski – grafite , sestak nick 's best xi : adler , bordon , boateng , naldo , hyypia , - kroos , ze roberto , özil , müller - kiessling , barrios nick 's worst xi : lehmann , wolf , braafheid , riether , maltritz – maniche , podolski hitzlsperger , freier – klose , raffael .
matt 's best xi : rost , castro , naldo , hyypia , boateng – oezil , ze roberto , sahin , kroos – kiessling , farfan matt 's worst xi : lehmann , stein , janker , barzagli , rozehnal – hleb , nicu , maniche , mintal – wichniarek , klose author : nick amies with contributions from paul chapman , jefferson chase and matt hermann .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .

however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .

" in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .

when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

" when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.12.2009 different decade , similar mistakes ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fighters , similar fight in afghanistan thirty years ago , the soviet union invaded afghanistan .
after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .

human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .
nationalists in serbia oppose the arrests as they consider mladic a wartime hero. rb / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .

in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .

kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .

she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .
nationalists in serbia oppose the arrests as they consider mladic a wartime hero. rb / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

" in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .

the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.12.2009 soccer giants schalke look to help struggling home town gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen club has taken up philanthropy schalke is the third-best supported club in germany , often attracting crowds of over 60,000 .
however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 25.12.2009 different decade , similar mistakes ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : different fighters , similar fight in afghanistan thirty years ago , the soviet union invaded afghanistan .
after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

while there are other factors sharing the blame for a global food shortage , including the high cost of oil , a growing population , poor harvests and diverting grains to use for bio-fuels , food waste contributes to the problem . " a lot of the food and agriculture in europe and the west is subsidized and this is a huge problem for producers in the developing world , " harjula said .
" their products are not competitive on these markets and as a result they can not sell their products , which leads to farmers losing income , losing their land and the poverty and hardship which comes from that . " food waste causing an environmental stink in addition to its effect on food supply in the developing world , landfills full of food are also detrimental to the environment . " here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots . " there are ways of collecting this gas from the decomposing food and using it for energy purposes but it is not a widespread practice at the moment , " harjula said .
" what must be done in the meantime is to find away of taking the organic material out of landfill refuse . " until there are more efficient means of harnessing methane , it 's important to keep food out of landfills , according to tom macmillan , executive director of the british food ethics council . " food waste is harmful and unfair , and it is essential to stop food going into landfill , " he told deutsche welle .
" now is the moment all parties should be searching out ways to define prosperity that get away from runaway consumption .
until they succeed , chucking out less food wo n't make our lifestyles more sustainable . " slow progress taken towards solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers can help by planning their shopping better european countries are already taking steps to reduce the production of methane from food waste deposited in landfill sites , harjula said .
the enforcement of the eu 's landfill directive is expected to reduce the amount of organic material in landfill sites to 35 percent by 2016 , but a number of european nations , including germany , the netherlands and switzerland , have already reduced their levels to 5 percent and in some cases even less . experts believe that much of the responsibility for reducing food waste rests with the manufacturers .
the food industry must find ways to reduce waste throughout the production and supply chain , and find ways to redistribute finished food products and reuse by-products of the production process . consumers of course can also do their bit .
by planning before shopping for food , consumers can reduce their food waste output at point-of-purchase and in their homes , while adhering to efficient food storage ideas can the amount of food which becomes inedible quickly and then thrown away . author : nick amies editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

this year , however , rather than passing this dubious honour to one of our resident soccer experts , we 've asked all our analysts to contribute a section each to the best and worst xis .
tackling the best and worst defenses will be nick amies , while paul chapman chooses the classiest and crummiest midfielders and the most dangerous and most profligate strikers have been picked by jefferson chase .
the best and worst xi 's will be overseen by coaches hired and fired by matt hermann .
the best xi : defense -lrb- nick amies -rrb- having an unbeaten team sitting on top of the league at the half-way point in the season makes it easy to pick the majority of the best defense in the bundesliga .
bayer leverkusen 's keep rene adler takes the no. 1 jersey in our best xi for his consistency and his role in keeping leverkusen 's goal difference down to 35 for and 13 against .
adler 's growing confidence and competence has also seen him stake a claim for the keeper 's shirt in germany 's world cup team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hyypia -lrb- l . -rrb- has been a rock at the back for leverkusen the best xi 's back four features adler 's leverkusen team-mate sami hyypia , who has shown that a change is as good as a rest .
contrary to the belief that his legs may not have been up for another season in the english premiership , hyypia has been a player reborn .
the big finn has shown that wealth of experience and mastery of positioning are qualities ideally suited to a leader charged with marshalling a young team chasing the bundesliga title .
hyypia is joined at the back by werder bremen 's naldo , hamburg 's jerome boateng and schalke 's marcelo bordon .
naldo remains one of the bundesliga 's most competent ball playing defenders , combining solid defensive qualities with a midfielder 's eye for a pass ; boateng has proved to be a versatile stopper for hsv and has shown enough to make the leap to the full germany squad this season , while bordon has played a strong role in schalke 's impressive defensive record this season , keeping them tied with leverkusen as the league 's most parsimonious defense .
best xi : midfield -lrb- paul chapman -rrb- leverkusen 's great start has been punctuated with displays by precocious youngsters and 19-year-old toni kroos in particular has caught the eye .
the on-loan bayern munich attacking midfielder has started to add goals to his threat and could return to munich in 2010 as one of the players who denied his employers the title .
another young tyro given license to maraud in the center of the park is dortmund 's turkish international nuri sahin .
back at bvb after a loan spell with feyenoord , sahin is again showing the flair which alerted many a european club when he burst onto the scene in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil provides a spark and goals in bremen 's midfield mesut oezil looks and plays like someone with ten years more experience .
the werder bremen star is a livewire attacking midfielder who thrives in bremen 's cavalier approach .
so far this season , oezil has contributed six goals to werder 's tally and got off the mark with the senior germany team in this his full international debut season .
completing the midfield , we have ze roberto , another player reborn .
few would have expected ze to stick around after leaving years of success at bayern behind but his performances for hamburg – before getting injured – showed a new hunger and his goals and assists helped hsv challenge at the top .
best xi : attack -lrb- jefferson chase -rrb- completing the best xi 's 4-4-2 formation are strikers stefan kiessling and lucas barrios .
leverkusen 's kiessling is having the season of his life so far , leading the bundesliga with his team and the scoring charts with 12 goals .
the rangy forward is enjoying a prolific partnership with patrick helmes and has earned himself a recall to the germany squad on the back of his stunning form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrios has scored the goals to send bvb soaring dortmund 's barrios is one of the main reasons why bvb are enjoying their best season in many a year .
the argentine has hit nine goals so far and has given bvb the cutting edge they have been missing for a long while .
it remains to be seen if barrios can keep them in the top four or higher for the rest of the season but his form to date suggests he 'll at least try .
best xi : coach -lrb- matt hermann -rrb- knowing what felix magath is capable of - winning a bundesliga title with an off-brand club like wolfsburg - his good start at schalke may not surprise you .
look again .
he inherited a side that had looked old , disorganized and out of ideas after last season ’ s disastrous fred rutten experiment , and has steered them into second place at the break .
despite his protests to the contrary , they are a legitimate threat to win the league .
he ’ s prodded last year ’ s underachieving veterans into some of their best form in years -lrb- bordon , kevin kuranyi -rrb- or dropped them from the squad -lrb- levan kobiashvili , gerald asamoah -rrb- ; he ’ s found raw gems in his own youth squad -lrb- joel matip , carlos zambrano -rrb- or poached them from local rivals -lrb- lewis holtby and christoph moritz from aachen , lukas schmitz from bochum -rrb- ; and he ’ s given a coherent shape to a side that struggled for years to find an identity .
they look a good bet to qualify for the champions league , and if -lrb- this is a big if -rrb- top-class players like jermaine jones or christian pander can come back from their long-term injuries to anything like top form , magath may go down in history as the man who broke schalke ’ s 52-year-long jinx .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

auxiliary bishops of dublin eamonn walsh and raymond field issued a statement that they had informed the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , that they would leave their positions .
four bishops have now resigned after a report released last month by the dublin archdiocese found that roman catholic authorities concealed child abuse by priests for three decades .
" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .
reputation of church placed ahead of children it was reported that more than 300 children were sexually abused by priests between 1975 and 2004 .
however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.12.2009 food waste turns stomachs in environmental circles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 40 percent of food produced in europe is wasted the amount of food thrown away and buried in landfills around europe and the united states is contributing to the global food crisis and adding a new dimension to the climate change debate . christmas has become a traditional time for over indulgence in western countries .
the holiday season seems to provide everyone with an excuse to eat and drink to excess .
supermarkets burst with sweet treats and a mind-boggling selection of festive fare . while most of it will be ingested , more than a third of food in europe and the united states will grow moldy fur in the back of the fridge , pass its use-by date and land in garbage . huge food waste problem developing in europe in the united kingdom , one of europe 's worst food waste offenders , around 6.7 million tons of purchased and edible food , worth £ 10.2 billion -lrb- 11.2 billion euros , $ 16.6 billion -rrb- , are annually discarded .
around 4.1 million tons of this wasted food comes directly from food manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the food produced in europe is thrown away " only 30 to 40 percent of produced in europe ends up at your table , " henrik harjula , the principal administrator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it is already disappearing when it is transported , when it is rotting and when it does n't meet european standards .
on top of this , in many countries in europe , one third of the food that consumers buy is thrown away and 50 percent of that is thrown away without even being opened . " add europe 's waste to that of the united states and the food waste problem becomes even larger .
around 40 percent of all food manufactured and put on sale in the united states is wasted , and studies show this trend is increasing .
food waste - including waste from farms , manufacturers , retailers and consumers - has risen 50 percent since 1974 , reaching about 150 trillion calories per year in 2003 . supermarkets sweeps food to trash a fascination with super and hypermarkets are partly to blame for the west 's food waste , according to harjula . " people tend to go to these supermarkets once or twice a month but how can you accurately evaluate how much you a going to consume ? " he asked .
" they ca n't tell so they buy extra .
of course , this suggests that consumers are to blame too but there is this trend across europe of ' buy one , get one free ' so people are buying a lot of food that they do n't need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in the developing world ca n't compete in the market the statistics relating to food waste sit uncomfortably with the continued reports of global food shortages and food price spikes .
while there are other factors sharing the blame for a global food shortage , including the high cost of oil , a growing population , poor harvests and diverting grains to use for bio-fuels , food waste contributes to the problem . " a lot of the food and agriculture in europe and the west is subsidized and this is a huge problem for producers in the developing world , " harjula said .
" their products are not competitive on these markets and as a result they can not sell their products , which leads to farmers losing income , losing their land and the poverty and hardship which comes from that . " food waste causing an environmental stink in addition to its effect on food supply in the developing world , landfills full of food are also detrimental to the environment . " here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots . " there are ways of collecting this gas from the decomposing food and using it for energy purposes but it is not a widespread practice at the moment , " harjula said .
" what must be done in the meantime is to find away of taking the organic material out of landfill refuse . " until there are more efficient means of harnessing methane , it 's important to keep food out of landfills , according to tom macmillan , executive director of the british food ethics council . " food waste is harmful and unfair , and it is essential to stop food going into landfill , " he told deutsche welle .
" now is the moment all parties should be searching out ways to define prosperity that get away from runaway consumption .
until they succeed , chucking out less food wo n't make our lifestyles more sustainable . " slow progress taken towards solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers can help by planning their shopping better european countries are already taking steps to reduce the production of methane from food waste deposited in landfill sites , harjula said .
the enforcement of the eu 's landfill directive is expected to reduce the amount of organic material in landfill sites to 35 percent by 2016 , but a number of european nations , including germany , the netherlands and switzerland , have already reduced their levels to 5 percent and in some cases even less . experts believe that much of the responsibility for reducing food waste rests with the manufacturers .
the food industry must find ways to reduce waste throughout the production and supply chain , and find ways to redistribute finished food products and reuse by-products of the production process . consumers of course can also do their bit .
by planning before shopping for food , consumers can reduce their food waste output at point-of-purchase and in their homes , while adhering to efficient food storage ideas can the amount of food which becomes inedible quickly and then thrown away . author : nick amies editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

" when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 25.12.2009 food waste turns stomachs in environmental circles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 40 percent of food produced in europe is wasted the amount of food thrown away and buried in landfills around europe and the united states is contributing to the global food crisis and adding a new dimension to the climate change debate . christmas has become a traditional time for over indulgence in western countries .
the holiday season seems to provide everyone with an excuse to eat and drink to excess .
supermarkets burst with sweet treats and a mind-boggling selection of festive fare . while most of it will be ingested , more than a third of food in europe and the united states will grow moldy fur in the back of the fridge , pass its use-by date and land in garbage . huge food waste problem developing in europe in the united kingdom , one of europe 's worst food waste offenders , around 6.7 million tons of purchased and edible food , worth £ 10.2 billion -lrb- 11.2 billion euros , $ 16.6 billion -rrb- , are annually discarded .
around 4.1 million tons of this wasted food comes directly from food manufacturers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of the food produced in europe is thrown away " only 30 to 40 percent of produced in europe ends up at your table , " henrik harjula , the principal administrator at the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- in paris , told deutsche welle .
" it is already disappearing when it is transported , when it is rotting and when it does n't meet european standards .
on top of this , in many countries in europe , one third of the food that consumers buy is thrown away and 50 percent of that is thrown away without even being opened . " add europe 's waste to that of the united states and the food waste problem becomes even larger .
around 40 percent of all food manufactured and put on sale in the united states is wasted , and studies show this trend is increasing .
food waste - including waste from farms , manufacturers , retailers and consumers - has risen 50 percent since 1974 , reaching about 150 trillion calories per year in 2003 . supermarkets sweeps food to trash a fascination with super and hypermarkets are partly to blame for the west 's food waste , according to harjula . " people tend to go to these supermarkets once or twice a month but how can you accurately evaluate how much you a going to consume ? " he asked .
" they ca n't tell so they buy extra .
of course , this suggests that consumers are to blame too but there is this trend across europe of ' buy one , get one free ' so people are buying a lot of food that they do n't need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers in the developing world ca n't compete in the market the statistics relating to food waste sit uncomfortably with the continued reports of global food shortages and food price spikes .
while there are other factors sharing the blame for a global food shortage , including the high cost of oil , a growing population , poor harvests and diverting grains to use for bio-fuels , food waste contributes to the problem . " a lot of the food and agriculture in europe and the west is subsidized and this is a huge problem for producers in the developing world , " harjula said .
" their products are not competitive on these markets and as a result they can not sell their products , which leads to farmers losing income , losing their land and the poverty and hardship which comes from that . " food waste causing an environmental stink in addition to its effect on food supply in the developing world , landfills full of food are also detrimental to the environment . " here in europe we consume so much globalized food , like kiwis from new zealand and pineapples from australia – all of which has to be transported over thousands of kilometers to get here , " harjula said of food 's environmental cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic waste in landfill sites creates a methane problem but it 's the methane created by rotting food that is having the worst effect on the climate , he added .
a greenhouse gas estimated to be 20 times worse for the atmosphere than carbon dioxide , methane is emitted from landfills as food rots . " there are ways of collecting this gas from the decomposing food and using it for energy purposes but it is not a widespread practice at the moment , " harjula said .
" what must be done in the meantime is to find away of taking the organic material out of landfill refuse . " until there are more efficient means of harnessing methane , it 's important to keep food out of landfills , according to tom macmillan , executive director of the british food ethics council . " food waste is harmful and unfair , and it is essential to stop food going into landfill , " he told deutsche welle .
" now is the moment all parties should be searching out ways to define prosperity that get away from runaway consumption .
until they succeed , chucking out less food wo n't make our lifestyles more sustainable . " slow progress taken towards solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers can help by planning their shopping better european countries are already taking steps to reduce the production of methane from food waste deposited in landfill sites , harjula said .
the enforcement of the eu 's landfill directive is expected to reduce the amount of organic material in landfill sites to 35 percent by 2016 , but a number of european nations , including germany , the netherlands and switzerland , have already reduced their levels to 5 percent and in some cases even less . experts believe that much of the responsibility for reducing food waste rests with the manufacturers .
the food industry must find ways to reduce waste throughout the production and supply chain , and find ways to redistribute finished food products and reuse by-products of the production process . consumers of course can also do their bit .
by planning before shopping for food , consumers can reduce their food waste output at point-of-purchase and in their homes , while adhering to efficient food storage ideas can the amount of food which becomes inedible quickly and then thrown away . author : nick amies editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

auxiliary bishops of dublin eamonn walsh and raymond field issued a statement that they had informed the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , that they would leave their positions .
four bishops have now resigned after a report released last month by the dublin archdiocese found that roman catholic authorities concealed child abuse by priests for three decades .
" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .
reputation of church placed ahead of children it was reported that more than 300 children were sexually abused by priests between 1975 and 2004 .
however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "
pressure still remains on other senior clergymen to quit over the scandal. mk / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.12.2009 soccer giants schalke look to help struggling home town gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen club has taken up philanthropy schalke is the third-best supported club in germany , often attracting crowds of over 60,000 .
however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers .

" gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

auxiliary bishops of dublin eamonn walsh and raymond field issued a statement that they had informed the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , that they would leave their positions .
four bishops have now resigned after a report released last month by the dublin archdiocese found that roman catholic authorities concealed child abuse by priests for three decades .
" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .
reputation of church placed ahead of children it was reported that more than 300 children were sexually abused by priests between 1975 and 2004 .
however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "
pressure still remains on other senior clergymen to quit over the scandal. mk / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

auxiliary bishops of dublin eamonn walsh and raymond field issued a statement that they had informed the archbishop of dublin , diarmuid martin , that they would leave their positions .
four bishops have now resigned after a report released last month by the dublin archdiocese found that roman catholic authorities concealed child abuse by priests for three decades .
" it is our hope that our action may help to bring the peace and reconciliation of jesus christ to the victims / survivors of child sexual abuse .
we again apologize to them , " said walsh and field in their statement .
reputation of church placed ahead of children it was reported that more than 300 children were sexually abused by priests between 1975 and 2004 .
however , church leaders did not bring cases to the police in order to avoid damaging the church 's reputation and assets .
ireland 's top catholic clergyman , cardinal sean brady , apologized to abuse survivors and their families during a christmas eve vigil mass in northern ireland .
" i declare my abhorrence at the breach of trust and the crimes that have been committed , " he said .
brady added that church leaders had " put the reputation of the church before the safety of little children . "
pressure still remains on other senior clergymen to quit over the scandal. mk / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .
but kaessman , leader of the ekd since october , warned against a hasty retreat , stressing the need for an exit strategy .
exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .
earlier this month , german newspapers reported that the defense ministry was drawing up plans to send an extra 2,000 troops to afghanistan . rc / kna / dpa / epd / reuters editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict .

vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .

the supreme court also confirmed the maximum sentence for milorad ulemek " legija , " the former head of an elite secret police unit , who was handed two 40-year jail terms for masterminding the murders of serbian reformist prime minister zoran djindjic in 2003 and former president ivan stambolic in 2000 .
the serbian court also confirmed the maximum sentence for two other members of ulemek 's notorious " red berets " police unit .
branko bercek and nenad illic steered a truck into a convoy of cars carrying draskovic in the 1999 attack , killing four of his associates .
those convicted have exhausted their avenues of appeal .
milosevic died in 2006 while on trial for genocide at a un war crimes court .
draskovic praised the verdict as historic because it convicted an ex-state security chief , but said “ no verdict can bring true justice . ”
tadic says mladic arrest vital for eu bid meanwhile , serbian president boris tadic said that now that his country has applied for european union membership , it must arrest the wartime commander of the bosnian serb army , ratko mladic , and another war crimes fugitive sought by a united nations court .
“ we can not go to europe without arresting ratko mladic and goran hadzic , ” tadic said late on thursday , referring to the two remaining suspects wanted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
tadic added that “ whoever says they are for european integration , must clearly say they are for the arrest of the hague suspects . ”
serbia applied for eu membership earlier this week , but the future of the bid hinges on the fugitives ' arrest .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.12.2009 soccer giants schalke look to help struggling home town gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen club has taken up philanthropy schalke is the third-best supported club in germany , often attracting crowds of over 60,000 .
however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .

human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .

liu is a leading pro-democracy campaigner in china . china 's most prominent dissident , liu xiaobo , has been sentenced by a beijing court to 11 years in prison for " incitement to subvert state power . "
the verdict has been met with sharp criticism by rights groups and the international community .
sweden , which holds the european union 's rotating presidency , condemned the decision , saying it raised concerns about freedom of speech and right to a fair trial in china .
" the presidency of the european union is deeply concerned by the disproportionate sentence against the prominent human rights defender liu xiaobo . " it said in a statement . the german government also strongly criticized the verdict .
" despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views , i regret that the chinese government still massively restricts press freedom . " said chancellor angela merkel in a statement . a us diplomat commented after the verdict that washington would " continue to call on the government of china to release -lrb- liu -rrb- immediately and to respect the rights of all chinese citizens to peacefully express their political views in favor of universally recognized fundamental freedoms . "
human rights groups said the sentence was one of the longest a chinese court has given on the subversion charge .
" since 2003 , china has sentenced more than 35 people using the vague charge of ' inciting subversion of state power ' to prison terms ranging from 1.5 to 11 years , " said amnesty international in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu 's supporters gathered outside the courtroom wearing yellow ribbons " among those , liu xiaobo 's sentence is the longest to have been handed down since 2003 , according to amnesty international 's records . "
human rights watch meanwhile called the sentence a " travesty of justice . "
in hong kong , several people were injured in protests that broke out following liu 's sentencing , reported german news agency dpa .
guilty for speaking freely liu , 53 , was a main author of the " charter 08 " manifesto which called for sweeping political reforms in china .
the beijing court ruled liu was guilty for his involvement in the manifesto and for publishing online essays critical of the ruling communist party .
liu was not allowed to respond to the court 's decision , though his wife , liu xia , said she " felt calm when the judge read out the sentence , because all signs were they wanted to hand out a long sentence . "
liu 's wife was allowed into the courtroom to hear the verdict being delivered , but she was prohibited from entering during the actual trial .
" later we were allowed 10 minutes together and he told me he would appeal , even if the chances of success were low , " she added .
western diplomats from more than a dozen countries and journalists were also excluded from the court proceedings .
liu had already served a prison sentence over his involvement in the 1989 tiananmen square pro-democracy protests .
beijing rejects criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western diplomats and officials were barred from the courtroom in the weeks leading up to the trial , the european union and the us had called on china to unconditionally release liu and " end the harassment and detention " of fellow signatories of the " charter 08 " manifesto .
beijing reacted angrily to those calls , referring to the eu and us statements as " unacceptable " and representing interference in china 's internal affairs .
" china is a country ruled by law , " a spokesperson for china 's foreign ministry had responded .
" the fundamental rights of chinese citizens are guaranteed by the law . "
the spokesperson said china 's courts acted " independently " and other nations have " no right to interfere . " mk / dfm / afp / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one . it 's been 30 years since the soviet union began its invasion of afghanistan in an effort to stabilize the then-communist government .
ten years later , local mujahedeen had banded together to push the soviets out of the country , but it was n't long before there were more foreign troops on the ground .
in 2001 , a mission led by the united states and the western military alliance nato toppled the taliban regime in afghanistan , but the troops have yet to leave .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suicide attacks are a constant threat in afghanistan today more than 110,000 foreign soldiers are in afghanistan under the nato and us led mission , fighting taliban forces left over after they were removed from power .
with the us and other nations with troops in the region pledging to intensify their efforts in 2010 , it begs the question whether the west is making the same mistakes in afghanistan as the soviet union did .
munir ahmed was born in the afghan capital kabul and was two years old when soviet troops began invading his country .
ahmed , now 32 , says his childhood was a stream of bad memories of fighting and death .
he clearly remembers placing the blame on the soviets for the violence and for the fact that afghanistan was in such bad shape .
today , he says the atmosphere is similar to the way it was back then - and in some ways , worse .
" back then , there were n't any suicide bombings , " ahmed said .
" it was also terrible then , too , but we were n't afraid of being blown up on the street , which happens today all the time .
back then , at least we could hear the rockets coming and take cover .
that was definitely better . "
" you ca n't win in afghanistan " it took more than nine years , but the islamist mujahedeen rebels - with help from the west on the sidelines - eventually defeated the soviets and drove them out of afghanistan .
but today , it is the west that seems to be losing its own battle there .
" you ca n't win in afghanistan , " says andrei avetisyan , russia 's ambassador to afghanistan .
" you can not win a war in afghanistan .
how many more examples must mankind have to understand that ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are part of the nato-led mission in afghanistan avetisyan thinks that the nato-led forces in afghanistan are making the same mistakes as the soviets in the 1980s .
he also believes the west is not doing enough of the one thing that might actually make a difference : helping with reconstruction .
much of the country has still not been rebuilt after the damage caused during the soviet conflict .
" without -lsb- reconstruction help -rsb- the coalition can fight here for years and decades and with no success in the end , " says avetisyan .
" it is not like the second world war where you are in berlin and you say , ' well it is a victory day . '
this is not going to happen in afghanistan .
someday , the international forces are going to leave , and the fighting may continue . "
god 's soldiers the taliban today describe themselves mujahedeen , or god 's soldiers - the same name taken by those who fought the soviets .
the taliban say they are fighting against international imperialists , the same enemy the rebel fighters claimed when fighting the soviets .
additionally , with the afghan civilian death toll on the rise , international troops in the country are being seen more and more as occupying forces , which is how most afghans perceived the soviets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan guerrilla handles a u.s.-made stinger missile in the late 80s .
waheed muzhda , a former mujahedeen fighter turned author , says the success of the rebel resistance against the soviets lay in its guerrilla nature .
he sees similar characteristics in the taliban 's tactics .
" the soviets were dealing with a resistance that was spread throughout the afghan countryside , " he says .
" this is exactly what the taliban are doing today .
when the us arrived here , they did n't understand right away that they had to win over the people in the villages .
the war today is a guerrilla war , just like it was for the soviets against the mujahedeen . "
all indications suggest that the current foreign forces in afghanistan will be in the country for longer than the soviets were .
most nations participating in the mission , including germany and the us , have hinted at plans for pulling their troops out of the country , but no concrete decisions have been made . but only when the nato-led troops finally do leave afghanistan will it be clear if the mistakes of the soviet campaign have been avoided .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.12.2009 soccer giants schalke look to help struggling home town gelsenkirchen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gelsenkirchen club has taken up philanthropy schalke is the third-best supported club in germany , often attracting crowds of over 60,000 .
however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

he urged tolerance for migrants in his message , which came amid concerns over his security . the spiritual leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics appeared back on form friday when he appeared in front of tens of thousands of people who had gathered in st. peter ’ s square in the vatican to hear his traditional christmas message . " in the face of the exodus of all those who migrate from their homelands and are driven away by hunger , intolerance or environmental degradation , " the roman catholic church calls for " an attitude of acceptance and welcome , " he said , looking calm and collected as he gave the " urbi et orbi " -lrb- to the city and the world -rrb- message just hours after a woman jumped a security barrier and lunged at him , causing him to fall to the ground . the 82-year-old german-born pope said that society remains " deeply marked by a severe economic crisis and the painful wounds of war and conflict . "
the pontiff also expressed solidarity with those affected by natural disasters and poverty . pope benedict urged catholics to " abandon all logic of violence and revenge " and engage with " force " and " generosity " on " the path of peaceful coexistence . " " unbalanced " assailant the assault occurred on thursday as benedict approached the main altar of st. peter 's basilica , bearing a gold cross . video footage showed the 82-year-old pontiff being knocked to the ground as a woman jumped the barrier to get to him .
he was not harmed and quickly returned to his feet , before continuing to lead a procession of 30 cardinals to the altar , where he delivered the traditional mass that marks the birth of jesus christ . however , onlookers said the pope appeared to be shaken by the incident while he gave his address . the attacker , identified as 25-year-old susanna maiolo , was seized by the pope 's security and handed over to police . a vatican spokesperson described the woman , who is of dual swiss-italian nationality , as " apparently unbalanced , " adding that she had attempted to jump a barricade to reach the pope at last year ’ s christmas mass . italian media said the woman did not harbor malicious intentions . an elderly french cardinal , who was also knocked to the ground in the commotion , is reported to have broken his hip . bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi appeared before tens of thousands of followers just hours after the assault vatican to review security the vatican has said it will review its security procedures following the incident .
vatican spokesman , father federico lombardi said it is not realistic to think the vatican can ensure 100 percent security for the pontiff considering he is regularly surrounded by tens of thousands of people for his audiences , masses and other events . the latest security scare comes less than two weeks after italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was struck in the face and injured by an assailant in a crowd in milan . pope calls for less focus on self this year 's christmas eve mass , which is traditionally held at midnight , was held two hours early due to concerns over pope benedict 's health .
the vatican said the change was " no cause for alarm , " and that the pontiff 's condition was " absolutely normal " for a man of his age . " conflict and lack of reconciliation in the world stem from the fact that we are locked into our own interests and opinions , into our own little private world , " benedict said in his address before a crowd of some 10,000 followers who had gathered in st. peter ’ s basilica . he also recounted the story of christ 's birth in a manger in bethlehem some 2,000 years ago , and urged people to find more time for god in both their personal lives and in society as a whole . " we live our lives by philosophies , amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger , " he said . rb / dfm / nw / afp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she says that the aims of operations in the country need to be defined . the head of germany 's protestant churches has taken aim at berlin 's military involvement in afghanistan .
in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .

exit strategy she said that the real aim of the german deployment had not been defined and that drug- and weapon-dealing should be stopped .
talks should also be attempted with the taliban , kaessmann said .
" all that should be asked is how to conduct an orderly withdrawal and come up with a civilian solution , " she said .
kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .
the german government has said it will make a decision on whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan following an international conference on how to assist the country in late january .

in interviews with two german newspapers , female bishop margot kaessmann called for the withdrawal of the country 's 4,400 troops from afghanistan .
kaessmann represents some 22 branches of protestantism in germany , as the head of the umbrella organisation for german protestants , the ekd .
her appeal comes as germany 's parliament prepares to consider increasing the troop deployment .
" there is no just war .
i can not legitimise it from a christian point of view , " kaessman said .

kaessmann , who is the lutheran bishop of hannover , made her comments in the newspapers berliner zeitung and hannoverschen allgemeinen .
she rejected the idea of withdrawing military chaplains , saying that this did not sanction war but provided help to those who needed it .

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .
but this was great , and now i want to know what they have planned for easter ! " a city in decline gelsenkirchen is an industrial city in germany 's ruhr valley , once the driving force behind the german economy .
this region was rich in natural resources , and the mining industry caused a population boom in a number of settlements starting around the industrial revolution . gelsenkirchen 's population peaked at just under 400,000 in 1959 , but over the next few decades , as the mines began closing , the city struggled to fight rising unemployment - which is now at almost double the german national average , approaching 20 percent . " gelsenkirchen is a very poor city in germany , " schalke 's beckers-schwarz says .
" you can compare it with some parts of the east of germany . " " every year the city gets smaller and smaller , the young people are going to the big cities like berlin , cologne and duesseldorf . a debt to gelsenkirchen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke coach felix magath is trying to break the club 's 51 year dry spell schalke is no stranger to tough times , either .
the club has flirted with bankruptcy during the darker days of its history , and only its status as the third-best supported club in the country helped keep it afloat . " in the ' 70s and ' 80s schalke had a lot of financial problems , and the supporters and everybody in gelsenkirchen was really supporting this club and even giving all their money to this club so it could survive , " beckers-schwarz explains . " now , schalke is in a situation to help the city and to help the people of gelsenkirchen .
we 're in a position to give something back . " other plans for the fledgling " schalke hilft " organization - which is primarily funded by the club and supplemented by charitable donations - include a scheme to provide laptop computers for kindergartens in some of the poorest areas of the city .
these should help young children - especially those of foreign origin - get their german language skills up to speed more quickly .
language deficiencies have been identified as one of the biggest problems holding back schools in more impoverished areas of germany . however , for all the good intentions , perhaps the greatest gift that the city of gelsenkirchen desires from its boys in blue and white is in schalke 's primary area of expertise . the club - despite its enormous support and a successful history in german and european soccer - has not won the german bundesliga in 51 years .
currently lying second in the table at the half way point , this could be schalke 's year , however , beckers-schwarz insists that the young squad is just targeting qualification for european competition - for now .

however , its home city , gelsenkirchen - once a mining boom town - is really struggling .
the soccer club is trying to help out . " schalke hilft " or " schalke is helping " is a charitable endeavour set up by german soccer giants schalke .
its goal is simple : to give something back to the club 's hometown of gelsenkirchen , which has seen better days . " this is my second life , " says schalke soccer club 's second in command for off-pitch activities , moritz beckers-schwarz , who runs " schalke hilft " voluntarily outside of office hours . " the event has gone really well , " he told deutsche welle at a special christmas luncheon in a soup kitchen for about 60 of gelsenkirchen 's poorest people .
" one woman told me that she had n't eaten properly for three days as she was getting her food . " this event was the first of its kind - " schalke hilft " was only conceived in july 2008 and is still somewhat in its infancy - but it was apparently a hit with the diners , as well as the organizers . " the food was great , really special , however , the food is always great here , " said irene , a regular visitor to this soup kitchen in the north of gelsenkirchen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mines no longer flourish in the ruhr valley " i had hoped a few players might be here , but it was n't to be , and that 's understandable - it 's christmas and they want to be at home , just like the rest of us .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

" when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath . " when you 're wounded and left on afghanistan 's plains , and the women come out to cut up what remains , just roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your god like a soldier . " - rudyard kipling - flying over jagged and barren seemingly endless mountain ranges it is not difficult to understand why afghanistan remains one of the most forbidding battlegrounds in the annals of warfare .
fiercely cold in the winter , the sun burns like a furnace in the summer .
there are few roads , water is scarce , the terrain is equally hard on machines and men and the thin , alpine air takes its toll on aircraft as well , like the dust and grit of afghanistan that clogs everything from soldier 's throats to rifles and engines .
for centuries , the hindu kush has been the graveyard of invading foreign armies .
afghanistan was where alexander the great 's phalanxes could not advance any further .
the british empire and the soldiers of the raj never conquered it .
in the 19th century an entire british army died to the last man , save for one who told the tale .
the much-vaunted soviet juggernaut did n't fare much better , the last gasp of the red army ultimately retreating in disgrace .
today , with 30,000 more us troops headed for the fray and washington hoping it can cajole 10,000 more european soldiers from nato when allied leaders meet at the end of next month , public support for a war that has endured since 2001 continues to wane on both sides of the atlantic .
failed states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if afghanistan becomes a failed state it could trigger problems in neighboring pakistan on the surface of things western leaders agree that the possibility of a failed afghan state and the potential collapse of a now embattled pakistan next door , poses a strategic security risk neither the region nor the international community can afford .
the doomsday scenario sees both nations collapse to the specter of islamic radicalism , al qaeda and other extremist groups newly empowered to launch international terror attacks by their taliban hosts , the surge of wahabi fanaticism spreading like a fire to the neighboring countries of central asia ripe for rebellion and most fearsome of all , pakistan 's nuclear arsenal falling into the hands of hateful mullahs who pledge eternal war on the west 's " crusaders and infidels . "
but if americans and europeans do n't fully agree on such an apocalyptic outcome , mission failure is not a prospect anyone seeks , because in of itself it would pose a massive psychological victory for radical islamists throughout the globe .
but what does it entail to continue prosecuting the war , aside from the astronomical cost of keeping armies in the field and a body count that now exceeds 1,500 allied dead and many more times that wounded and maimed ?
what is it like for a nato or coalition soldier in the field ?
it is a reality the average western civilian can not remotely comprehend .
for christian auchincloss , a former british paratrooper and longtime private security contractor , recently retired from heading one of the major western risk consultancies in afghanistan , the greatest difficulty is as old as guerrilla warfare itself .
" it 's the classic unseen enemy who does n't wear a uniform .
he hides his rifle in a secret cache and blends with the market dweller and the farmer , picking up a hoe instead .
but when he 's ready he finds his rifle or bomb and strikes , only to melt away once more , unseen , " he told deutsche welle .
taliban terror bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taliban militants may not be well-equipped but they are extremely mobile and versatile the taliban fighters thought to number anywhere from 10,000 to perhaps double or twice that number are not heavily equipped combatants .
in conventional terms they are mostly armed with infantry weapons , small arms , rocket launchers , mortars and recoilless rifles .
they know their own terrain intimately , every hidden mountain pathway , every cave that becomes a fortress , every village safe house where they can find sanctuary and support and in what is now termed " asymmetric warfare " where the weak can fight the strong .
unlike nato soldiers or the afghan army , more often than not they choose the time and place of combat , wresting the tactical initiative away from a much more powerful and technologically advanced western adversary .
the taliban fighter is also highly mobile , well-funded and equipped from the underground profits of the world 's leading heroin producer and not least highly motivated and better-paid than his afghan national army counterpart .
by contrast , morale in both the ana and the afghan national police is decidedly poor , and eight years on save for a few elite formations , both remain badly trained , under-equipped and indifferently led .
as the soviets soon discovered , although heavy armor , artillery and attack aircraft bring overwhelming firepower to bear , it is often taking a sledgehammer to crush a mosquito , prompting too many civilian casualties that only damages hearts and minds efforts .
it is seldom that small-arms fire claims western casualties however , in the improved taliban war-fighting guide much has been learned from the experience of jihadists and insurgents in iraq , where the improvised explosive device or ied rules supreme , and so it does too in afghanistan .
they are unseen , largely undetected and they kill without warning .
more than any other weapon , the ied is what sends nato and coalition soldiers home in body bags .
the result is that road travel is extremely hazardous and allied soldiers have come to rely on mine proof vehicles , but they are n't foolproof either and the taliban keep improving the explosive strength of their bombs to counter them .
allies facing uphill battle bildunterschrift : the nato-led isaf troops seem unable to eject the taliban from afghanistan so the helicopter as a means of observation , supply and tactical troop deployment has also become invaluable for allied forces , but there are n't enough of them and in many respects the sheer nature of combat in afghanistan nullifies much of the technological advantage allied soldiers bring to bear .
over the past year , there were nearly 3,300 separate ied attacks nationwide , that number is likely to climb .
where allied soldiers have seen old-fashioned infantry fighting against the taliban , a disturbing development is where the " black turbans , " who once attacked solely in small formations , have increasingly in the past year launched attacks with hundreds of fighters , sometimes overrunning allied firebases .
it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .

it is a confident enemy that can dare to make frontal assaults and it is an enemy secure in replacing his casualties , when he can endure them hundreds at a time .
western leaders keeping a close eye on public opinion at home ca n't afford to be as generous with their own combat losses .
the inescapable reality of the military dimension of afghanistan 's war is that where matters stand , though the taliban is increasingly gaining control of larger and larger swathes of afghanistan 's territory , it is not strong enough to dislodge nato or the coalition , nor are they in turn strong enough themselves to both secure afghanistan 's terrain and eject the taliban .
so it will be a bloody impasse for a long time to come unless at last nato is able to coordinate success on the battlefield with winning the peace and helping to secure a safer and more democratic and less-corrupt afghanistan .
when us president barack obama announced a potential withdrawal date , which has already been backpedaled , the elusive taliban leader mullah omar responded , " they have the clock , we have the time . "
and so perhaps afghanistan , like all protracted guerrilla wars , comes down to willpower , attrition and the ability to sit out the enemy , in the hope he will tire of an endless fight .
for afghanistan 's immediate future it looks like this means more of the same and no end game in sight .
