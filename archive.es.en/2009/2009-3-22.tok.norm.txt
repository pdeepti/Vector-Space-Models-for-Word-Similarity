" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .
polls show the czech public is largely opposed to the system . tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .

his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .
polls show the czech public is largely opposed to the system . tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .

russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .

but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .

russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .
modified skis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodbye , sankt moritz !
and hello , namibia !
may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
instead of quaffing spiked cocoa at the bottom of the slope , tourists get to drink in a crimson namibian sunset and watch the world - as well as the antelope , rhinos and ostriches - go by . mrm / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .

" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "

the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .
modified skis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodbye , sankt moritz !
and hello , namibia !
may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
instead of quaffing spiked cocoa at the bottom of the slope , tourists get to drink in a crimson namibian sunset and watch the world - as well as the antelope , rhinos and ostriches - go by . mrm / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .
modified skis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodbye , sankt moritz !
and hello , namibia !
may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
instead of quaffing spiked cocoa at the bottom of the slope , tourists get to drink in a crimson namibian sunset and watch the world - as well as the antelope , rhinos and ostriches - go by . mrm / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "

the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .

russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .
polls show the czech public is largely opposed to the system . tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .

warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .

russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .
modified skis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodbye , sankt moritz !
and hello , namibia !
may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
instead of quaffing spiked cocoa at the bottom of the slope , tourists get to drink in a crimson namibian sunset and watch the world - as well as the antelope , rhinos and ostriches - go by . mrm / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .

if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .

may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .

warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .

" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .

washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .
sand slalom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if global warming continues , skiing on sand might become more commonplace may , who grew up in germany 's black forest told dpa news agency that skiing across the desert is far easier than walking because one does n't sink into the sand .
if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .
modified skis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goodbye , sankt moritz !
and hello , namibia !
may has had to fit cross-country skis with special bindings that work in the sand to make his journey .
he has also developed a special type of wax that enables the skis to slide over the sand .
his wax recipe is a closely-guarded secret , however .
may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
instead of quaffing spiked cocoa at the bottom of the slope , tourists get to drink in a crimson namibian sunset and watch the world - as well as the antelope , rhinos and ostriches - go by . mrm / kjb / tt / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .
polls show the czech public is largely opposed to the system . tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .

" we hope we do n't regret our trust in the united states , " polish foreign minister radoslaw sikorski said at the brussels forum conference to an audience of senior world politicians and experts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sikorski expects continuity from us foreign policy russia was enraged by the us missile plans - which the last administration under george w. bush said was needed to counter a threat from iran - but has welcomed the review ordered by president barack obama .
" i am afraid russian generals and even the russian president continue to threaten us with the deployment of medium-range missiles , " sikorski said .
but congresswoman ellen tauscher , who is expected to become the new undersecretary for arms control and international security in the new us administration , said it was more important to counter the real threat from short- and medium-range missiles , while the review takes place .
" we need to re-assess , " she said , noting that the us congress believes the shield should not be deployed further until it has undergone " three or four more tests . "
" the threat is short- and medium-range missiles targeted towards our forward deployed troops , and our allies in southern europe , " she said .
" we could certainly bolt on the long-range system once it has been tested and create a suite of systems that have complete coverage for everybody . "
bitter opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia said it could station its iskander missiles near the polish border russia has been bitterly opposed to the deployment of a us anti-missile system in poland and the czech republic ever since it was proposed by the former us president george w. bush .
the us had been negotiating with the two ex-communist countries to install 10 missile interceptors , which would not carry explosive warheads , and a radar system on their territories .
moscow saw the interceptor system , which was initially meant to be in operation by 2013 , as a threat to its own security .
washington always denied this , emphasizing that the system was meant to counter missile threats from states such as iran .
russia , in turn , had threatened to deploy iskander missiles to kaliningrad , a russian exclave wedged between nato and eu members poland and lithuania , if washington did not withdraw the missile shield plan .
but it was assuaged by obama 's decision to order a review of the multi-billion dollar project to see whether it is still technically feasible and cost effective .
the time needed to conduct it is unclear .
fear of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will us presdent obama , left , keep the promises made by george w. bush ?
warsaw sees the presence of a us shield on its territory as a symbolic security guarantee to counter an increasingly assertive russia .
russia opposed nato 's admission of the three ex-communist countries - poland , the czech republic and hungary - in 1999 and is campaigning strongly against georgia and ukraine , former soviet republics , being allowed to join an alliance that russians still view with deep distrust .
but sikorski stressed that poland had taken " something of a political risk " in signing an agreement with the previous us administration .
" when we started discussing this with the united states , the us assured us they would persuade the russians that it was purely defensive and it would be a non-controversial decision , " he said .
last month , polish defense minister bogdan klich said talks with washington on the plan , and in particular the stationing of us patriot missiles in poland and other benefits warsaw stood to gain , were ongoing .
czech officials , however , have said they would be prepared to wait three years for work on the radar base to begin .
polls show the czech public is largely opposed to the system . tt / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's henrik may and his austrian business partner herbert koessner are hoping to turn dune skiing into a viable business in the arid african nation of namibia .
the two set out last weekend on a cross-country ski trip covering 90 kilometers -lrb- 56 miles -rrb- over a span of six days in an attempt to become the first people to cross part of the vast namib desert , which stretches along the atlantic coast of namibia and southern angola .
the two are carrying their own food and water , and are being followed by an escort vehicle carrying the rest of the supplies , including their tents .

if the trek goes well , the pair plans to turn sand trekking into a full-time business , which will open to tourists starting in august 2009 .
many tourists have already taken to descending the sand dunes in the namib desert on skis or surfboards .
riding down the dunes has been a popular sport in the former german colony , and may has been running a ski rental shop here since 2004 .
both may and koessner say that skiing down a 300-meter -lrb- nearly 1,000-foot -rrb- desert dune is as exciting , in its own way , as taking to an alpine slope .

may says that anyone considering a ski trek needs to be in good shape , have some skiing experience and be able to live for a week without luxuries like a hot shower .
sand skiing differs from the snow version in another way : there are no apres-ski parties or other mass-tourism features .
