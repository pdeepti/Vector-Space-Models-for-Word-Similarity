he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .
on wednesday , pirates seized the danish-owned container ship maersk alabama with 20 us crew on board in the indian ocean .
meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group .

the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .
following the passage of the law , flowers said he may seek “ legal recourse ” to safeguard the interests of investors . sje / pfd , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .

the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .

during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .

" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .
“ mischa , get out ! ”
while the government and the opposition are determined to keep the demonstrations peaceful , tensions are running high amid fear the protests could spark civil unrest .
the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad inaugurates the country 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant ahmadinejad made his remarks on thursday at a ceremony marking iran 's nuclear day : the inauguration of the nation 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in the central province of isfahan .
iran says it has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle it also says it has tested new , more advanced machines for enriching uranium . the isfahan plant is expected to produce uranium pellets , fuel rods and fuel to power the arak heavy water reactor .
ahmadinejad also inspected the natanz uranium enrichment plant near isfahan , where the number of operating centrifuges have reportedly been increased to 7,000. db / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad inaugurates the country 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant ahmadinejad made his remarks on thursday at a ceremony marking iran 's nuclear day : the inauguration of the nation 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in the central province of isfahan .
iran says it has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle it also says it has tested new , more advanced machines for enriching uranium . the isfahan plant is expected to produce uranium pellets , fuel rods and fuel to power the arak heavy water reactor .
ahmadinejad also inspected the natanz uranium enrichment plant near isfahan , where the number of operating centrifuges have reportedly been increased to 7,000. db / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .

official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .

several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .
“ mischa , get out ! ”
while the government and the opposition are determined to keep the demonstrations peaceful , tensions are running high amid fear the protests could spark civil unrest .
the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .
saakashvili joined hundreds of people in front of the parliament in a quiet vigil in commemoration of the victims. db / rm / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .

pass this message on . " after protests turned violent on tuesday , cell phone service in the areas surrounding the demonstrations was not available .
whether disruptions were initiated by authorities to stem protesters ' ability to communicate or if phone networks were overloaded by the massive crowds gathering in the capital of chisinau remains unclear . unfiltered reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twitter users flagged their messages with the label # pman but outside of the main protest areas protesters were able to access the internet to post updates on twitter and facebook . messages on thursday said ngos and student groups were planning protests at avram iancu square and linked to youtube videos of demonstrators reporting cases of abuse by the police . using the searchable keyword # pman , named after chisinau 's central square 's romanian name piata marii adunari nationale , twitter postings , called tweets , have flooded the online service so much that the protests have been dubbed the " twitter revolution . " " chisinau surrounded by troops , " a user named robintel posted wednesday on the micro-blogging service twitter .
" people are protesting .
the us said the elections were ok .
not nice . " membership at several groups set up on social networking site facebook have seen membership swell since protests began monday .
one such group titled " support moldova " boasted nearly 7,000 on thursday . decentralized organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have a difficult time controlling information on facebook and twitter the protests were spearheaded by a committee of activists called " i am an anti-communist " and their size came as a surprise not just to the government but also to mainstream opposition parties that lost sunday 's election . " using the internet we managed to gather 15,000 people on the square in a few minutes , " natalya morar , one of the leaders of the committee , told reporters . twitter and facebook posts , though often not verified by independent sources , are proving to be a major source of information about developing events in chisinau .
some 18 journalists working for romanian and international media were prevented from entering moldova on wednesday , and other romanian journalists were sent back from chisinau airport , according to reporters without borders . wide-spread use of mobile phones and text messaging was seen to be a central element in the success of the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine as well as protests in belarus in 2006 .
internet-based media platforms also provided nearly instantaneous reports from terror attacks in mumbai , the crash landing of a passenger plane in the hudson river near manhattan , and an earthquake in china . but despite the large amount of updates emerging via social media from chisinau , bloggers in eastern europe have also complained about the lack of information getting in . since -lrb- the media -rrb- have no facts to report , they published an article about the social networking aspects of the protests , " wrote kyiv-based , american blogger ann m. merrill .

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .

a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .
following the passage of the law , flowers said he may seek “ legal recourse ” to safeguard the interests of investors . sje / pfd , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .
following the passage of the law , flowers said he may seek “ legal recourse ” to safeguard the interests of investors . sje / pfd , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2009 financial crisis represents risk , opportunity for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economically vulnerable nations in africa will be the immediate losers of the crisis , messner said the head of the german development institute says the financial crisis will likely be extremely detrimental to the developing world .
he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .

however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .
on wednesday , pirates seized the danish-owned container ship maersk alabama with 20 us crew on board in the indian ocean .
meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .
it is the sixth ship to be seized this week . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .

a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2009 financial crisis represents risk , opportunity for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economically vulnerable nations in africa will be the immediate losers of the crisis , messner said the head of the german development institute says the financial crisis will likely be extremely detrimental to the developing world .
he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .

a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
this marks a significant shift from former president george w. bush 's position that the us would not enter into talks with iran until it suspended all nuclear activities . nrt / mh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .
on wednesday , pirates seized the danish-owned container ship maersk alabama with 20 us crew on board in the indian ocean .
meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .
it is the sixth ship to be seized this week . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

argentine striker lionel messi found the back of the net twice and samuel eto 'o from cameroon and french international thierry henry scored once each as the primera liga leaders took firm control of the tie ahead of next tuesday 's second leg .
bayern had no answer to barca 's pace and slick passing .
barca coach pep guardiola said the key to his side 's emphatic win had been their ability to shut out bayern playmaker franck ribery and striker luca toni and maintain posession of the ball so effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc barcelona 's lionel messi of argentina celebrates scoring the opening goal against bayern munich " i was pleased with every aspect of our play and i get goose bumps when i see how hard my players are working , " he said at a post-match news conference .
" but it 's just the first leg of the quarterfinals and we need to keep our feet on the ground and try to score one or two goals in the return leg . "
bayern , who were missing central defenders lucio and daniel van buyten , left back philipp lahm and striker miroslav klose , rarely threatened victor valdes in the barca goal .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann conceded that the club would have to put their champions league ambitions on ice for another year and focus their efforts on trying to defend their bundesliga title .

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .

the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .

i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .

official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .

the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .

the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .

meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pass this message on . " after protests turned violent on tuesday , cell phone service in the areas surrounding the demonstrations was not available .
whether disruptions were initiated by authorities to stem protesters ' ability to communicate or if phone networks were overloaded by the massive crowds gathering in the capital of chisinau remains unclear . unfiltered reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twitter users flagged their messages with the label # pman but outside of the main protest areas protesters were able to access the internet to post updates on twitter and facebook . messages on thursday said ngos and student groups were planning protests at avram iancu square and linked to youtube videos of demonstrators reporting cases of abuse by the police . using the searchable keyword # pman , named after chisinau 's central square 's romanian name piata marii adunari nationale , twitter postings , called tweets , have flooded the online service so much that the protests have been dubbed the " twitter revolution . " " chisinau surrounded by troops , " a user named robintel posted wednesday on the micro-blogging service twitter .
" people are protesting .
the us said the elections were ok .
not nice . " membership at several groups set up on social networking site facebook have seen membership swell since protests began monday .
one such group titled " support moldova " boasted nearly 7,000 on thursday . decentralized organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have a difficult time controlling information on facebook and twitter the protests were spearheaded by a committee of activists called " i am an anti-communist " and their size came as a surprise not just to the government but also to mainstream opposition parties that lost sunday 's election . " using the internet we managed to gather 15,000 people on the square in a few minutes , " natalya morar , one of the leaders of the committee , told reporters . twitter and facebook posts , though often not verified by independent sources , are proving to be a major source of information about developing events in chisinau .
some 18 journalists working for romanian and international media were prevented from entering moldova on wednesday , and other romanian journalists were sent back from chisinau airport , according to reporters without borders . wide-spread use of mobile phones and text messaging was seen to be a central element in the success of the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine as well as protests in belarus in 2006 .
internet-based media platforms also provided nearly instantaneous reports from terror attacks in mumbai , the crash landing of a passenger plane in the hudson river near manhattan , and an earthquake in china . but despite the large amount of updates emerging via social media from chisinau , bloggers in eastern europe have also complained about the lack of information getting in . since -lrb- the media -rrb- have no facts to report , they published an article about the social networking aspects of the protests , " wrote kyiv-based , american blogger ann m. merrill .

pass this message on . " after protests turned violent on tuesday , cell phone service in the areas surrounding the demonstrations was not available .
whether disruptions were initiated by authorities to stem protesters ' ability to communicate or if phone networks were overloaded by the massive crowds gathering in the capital of chisinau remains unclear . unfiltered reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twitter users flagged their messages with the label # pman but outside of the main protest areas protesters were able to access the internet to post updates on twitter and facebook . messages on thursday said ngos and student groups were planning protests at avram iancu square and linked to youtube videos of demonstrators reporting cases of abuse by the police . using the searchable keyword # pman , named after chisinau 's central square 's romanian name piata marii adunari nationale , twitter postings , called tweets , have flooded the online service so much that the protests have been dubbed the " twitter revolution . " " chisinau surrounded by troops , " a user named robintel posted wednesday on the micro-blogging service twitter .
" people are protesting .
the us said the elections were ok .
not nice . " membership at several groups set up on social networking site facebook have seen membership swell since protests began monday .
one such group titled " support moldova " boasted nearly 7,000 on thursday . decentralized organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have a difficult time controlling information on facebook and twitter the protests were spearheaded by a committee of activists called " i am an anti-communist " and their size came as a surprise not just to the government but also to mainstream opposition parties that lost sunday 's election . " using the internet we managed to gather 15,000 people on the square in a few minutes , " natalya morar , one of the leaders of the committee , told reporters . twitter and facebook posts , though often not verified by independent sources , are proving to be a major source of information about developing events in chisinau .
some 18 journalists working for romanian and international media were prevented from entering moldova on wednesday , and other romanian journalists were sent back from chisinau airport , according to reporters without borders . wide-spread use of mobile phones and text messaging was seen to be a central element in the success of the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine as well as protests in belarus in 2006 .
internet-based media platforms also provided nearly instantaneous reports from terror attacks in mumbai , the crash landing of a passenger plane in the hudson river near manhattan , and an earthquake in china . but despite the large amount of updates emerging via social media from chisinau , bloggers in eastern europe have also complained about the lack of information getting in . since -lrb- the media -rrb- have no facts to report , they published an article about the social networking aspects of the protests , " wrote kyiv-based , american blogger ann m. merrill .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
this marks a significant shift from former president george w. bush 's position that the us would not enter into talks with iran until it suspended all nuclear activities . nrt / mh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .
on wednesday , pirates seized the danish-owned container ship maersk alabama with 20 us crew on board in the indian ocean .
meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .
it is the sixth ship to be seized this week . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "

now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
this marks a significant shift from former president george w. bush 's position that the us would not enter into talks with iran until it suspended all nuclear activities . nrt / mh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .
“ mischa , get out ! ”
while the government and the opposition are determined to keep the demonstrations peaceful , tensions are running high amid fear the protests could spark civil unrest .
the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .
saakashvili joined hundreds of people in front of the parliament in a quiet vigil in commemoration of the victims. db / rm / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .
“ mischa , get out ! ”
while the government and the opposition are determined to keep the demonstrations peaceful , tensions are running high amid fear the protests could spark civil unrest .
the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .
saakashvili joined hundreds of people in front of the parliament in a quiet vigil in commemoration of the victims. db / rm / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2009 financial crisis represents risk , opportunity for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economically vulnerable nations in africa will be the immediate losers of the crisis , messner said the head of the german development institute says the financial crisis will likely be extremely detrimental to the developing world .
he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .

iran says it has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle it also says it has tested new , more advanced machines for enriching uranium . the isfahan plant is expected to produce uranium pellets , fuel rods and fuel to power the arak heavy water reactor .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .

iran says it has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle it also says it has tested new , more advanced machines for enriching uranium . the isfahan plant is expected to produce uranium pellets , fuel rods and fuel to power the arak heavy water reactor .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .

now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
this marks a significant shift from former president george w. bush 's position that the us would not enter into talks with iran until it suspended all nuclear activities . nrt / mh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the opposition accuses saakashvili of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms . tens-of-thousands of georgians are demonstrating in the capital tbilisi for the resignation of president mikheil saakashvili .
opposition leaders accuse the president of monopolising power and stifling democratic reforms promised in the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power .
they say they will demonstrate outside parliament in tbilisi every day until saakashvili steps down and calls early elections .
there has been mounting criticism since last august , when russia crushed a georgian assault on the breakaway province of south ossetia and sent tanks to within 40 km of tbilisi .
saakashvili , opponents say , acted impulsively when he launched the military offensive without regard for the consequences .
“ mischa , get out ! ”
while the government and the opposition are determined to keep the demonstrations peaceful , tensions are running high amid fear the protests could spark civil unrest .
the west is wary of a possible repeat of a brutal crackdown on peaceful anti-government protesters in november 2007 . thursday 's demonstration coincided with the anniversary of a bloody crackdown by soviet troops against georgians demanding independence for the republic 20 years ago .
saakashvili joined hundreds of people in front of the parliament in a quiet vigil in commemoration of the victims. db / rm / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

argentine striker lionel messi found the back of the net twice and samuel eto 'o from cameroon and french international thierry henry scored once each as the primera liga leaders took firm control of the tie ahead of next tuesday 's second leg .
bayern had no answer to barca 's pace and slick passing .
barca coach pep guardiola said the key to his side 's emphatic win had been their ability to shut out bayern playmaker franck ribery and striker luca toni and maintain posession of the ball so effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc barcelona 's lionel messi of argentina celebrates scoring the opening goal against bayern munich " i was pleased with every aspect of our play and i get goose bumps when i see how hard my players are working , " he said at a post-match news conference .
" but it 's just the first leg of the quarterfinals and we need to keep our feet on the ground and try to score one or two goals in the return leg . "
bayern , who were missing central defenders lucio and daniel van buyten , left back philipp lahm and striker miroslav klose , rarely threatened victor valdes in the barca goal .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann conceded that the club would have to put their champions league ambitions on ice for another year and focus their efforts on trying to defend their bundesliga title .
" we clearly showed our limitations tonight in the face of a superb performance from barca , " he told a news conference .

argentine striker lionel messi found the back of the net twice and samuel eto 'o from cameroon and french international thierry henry scored once each as the primera liga leaders took firm control of the tie ahead of next tuesday 's second leg .
bayern had no answer to barca 's pace and slick passing .
barca coach pep guardiola said the key to his side 's emphatic win had been their ability to shut out bayern playmaker franck ribery and striker luca toni and maintain posession of the ball so effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc barcelona 's lionel messi of argentina celebrates scoring the opening goal against bayern munich " i was pleased with every aspect of our play and i get goose bumps when i see how hard my players are working , " he said at a post-match news conference .
" but it 's just the first leg of the quarterfinals and we need to keep our feet on the ground and try to score one or two goals in the return leg . "
bayern , who were missing central defenders lucio and daniel van buyten , left back philipp lahm and striker miroslav klose , rarely threatened victor valdes in the barca goal .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann conceded that the club would have to put their champions league ambitions on ice for another year and focus their efforts on trying to defend their bundesliga title .
" we clearly showed our limitations tonight in the face of a superb performance from barca , " he told a news conference .

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .
following the passage of the law , flowers said he may seek “ legal recourse ” to safeguard the interests of investors . sje / pfd , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .

moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .

russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .

the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .

however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .

the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 09.04.2009 financial crisis represents risk , opportunity for developing nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economically vulnerable nations in africa will be the immediate losers of the crisis , messner said the head of the german development institute says the financial crisis will likely be extremely detrimental to the developing world .
he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .

there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .
wood added that iran was entitled to a civilian nuclear program , but that such a program also entailed responsibilities .
" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "
on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
tehran maintains its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears iran is secretly building nuclear bombs , and has urged the country to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment activities , which can have both civilian and military uses . the un security council has already imposed three resolutions against iran for refusing to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad inaugurates the country 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant ahmadinejad made his remarks on thursday at a ceremony marking iran 's nuclear day : the inauguration of the nation 's first nuclear fuel manufacturing plant in the central province of isfahan .
iran says it has mastered the nuclear fuel cycle it also says it has tested new , more advanced machines for enriching uranium . the isfahan plant is expected to produce uranium pellets , fuel rods and fuel to power the arak heavy water reactor .
ahmadinejad also inspected the natanz uranium enrichment plant near isfahan , where the number of operating centrifuges have reportedly been increased to 7,000. db / rm , dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he insisted that iran 's nuclear rights be respected .
speaking in isfahan on thursday , ahmadinejad said iran was a peace-loving country but that it would not make any concessions on its nuclear rights as it followed nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- and international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- regulations .
the iranian president welcomed us president barack obama 's call for a world free of nuclear weapons .
“ we are even ready to pay our share in this regard , " ahmadinejad added .
during his visit to prague last week obama urged an immediate end to nuclear testing and outlined his vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
and , breaking with past u.s. policy of shunning direct talks with tehran , the obama administration said it would join in nuclear discussions with iran from now on .
but washington has reacted cautiously to the iranian president 's willingness to hold talks .
" the international community has some very serious concerns about the nuclear program , " us state department spokesman robert wood said .

" we again call on iran to comply with its obligations . "

whether disruptions were initiated by authorities to stem protesters ' ability to communicate or if phone networks were overloaded by the massive crowds gathering in the capital of chisinau remains unclear . unfiltered reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twitter users flagged their messages with the label # pman but outside of the main protest areas protesters were able to access the internet to post updates on twitter and facebook . messages on thursday said ngos and student groups were planning protests at avram iancu square and linked to youtube videos of demonstrators reporting cases of abuse by the police . using the searchable keyword # pman , named after chisinau 's central square 's romanian name piata marii adunari nationale , twitter postings , called tweets , have flooded the online service so much that the protests have been dubbed the " twitter revolution .

" people are protesting .

" using the internet we managed to gather 15,000 people on the square in a few minutes , " natalya morar , one of the leaders of the committee , told reporters . twitter and facebook posts , though often not verified by independent sources , are proving to be a major source of information about developing events in chisinau .
some 18 journalists working for romanian and international media were prevented from entering moldova on wednesday , and other romanian journalists were sent back from chisinau airport , according to reporters without borders . wide-spread use of mobile phones and text messaging was seen to be a central element in the success of the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine as well as protests in belarus in 2006 .
internet-based media platforms also provided nearly instantaneous reports from terror attacks in mumbai , the crash landing of a passenger plane in the hudson river near manhattan , and an earthquake in china . but despite the large amount of updates emerging via social media from chisinau , bloggers in eastern europe have also complained about the lack of information getting in . since -lrb- the media -rrb- have no facts to report , they published an article about the social networking aspects of the protests , " wrote kyiv-based , american blogger ann m. merrill .

us district judge shira a. scheindlin rejected requests by several countries that the lawsuits should not go ahead to protect relations between the united states and south africa .
the judge , who issued the decision in writing on wednesday , allowed claims made by tens of thousands of south african plaintiffs in two lawsuits in the us federal court to proceed against germany 's daimler and rheinmetall ag , as well as general motors , ford and ibm .
the plaintiffs claim they were forced from their homes and resettled , arrested and imprisoned without cause and beaten and tortured by the authorities .
plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages many more major corporations were initially sued in 2002 , but the case was dismissed by a district judge , only to be reinstated by a court of appeals in 2007 .
the complaints were amended with fewer companies targeted .
judge scheindlin stated in her ruling that corporate defendants accused of merely doing business with the apartheid government of south africa were dismissed. db / rm , dpa / reuters / lnw send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 09.04.2009 georgian president under pressure as opposition calls for resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saakashvili is accused of mismanaging the war with russia and resisting democratic reforms georgian president mikheil saakashvili has gone from a leader praised for giving moscow a bloody nose to a man seen as a liability responsible for his country 's problems .
now his critics want him removed from office . georgia became the focus of the world 's concerns in august 2008 when its president , mikheil saakashvili , launched a large-scale military attack against neighboring south ossetia in an attempt to regain control of the breakaway state .
saakashvili 's assault backfired when russia retaliated to the attack on a region allied to moscow by forcing georgian troops out of south ossetia and pursuing them far into georgian territory .
after heavy fighting and fears that russia would attempt to overthrow saakashvili by taking the capital tbilisi , an eu-brokered peace plan brought the war to a close .
the international fall-out was widespread .
the eu and the united states in particular condemned the russian aggression , scaling back relations with moscow over its perceived disproportionate response .
in turn , the russians accused the united states of fomenting the unrest which led to the georgian attack on south ossetia and supporting saakashvili 's government during the war .
the eu , us and nato all downgraded their diplomatic ties with russia and while talk of a new cold war was a little overdramatic , there was definitely a deep chill .
since then , both the west and russia have mended some , but not all , of the fences damaged during the war .
relations have thawed and ties have been re-established .
a new president in the white house has reached out to his counterpart at the kremlin and while no-one is organizing sleep-overs , names have been put back on christmas card lists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of protestors heeded the opposition 's call but what of georgia ?
after the war , the world 's attention briefly lingered on the destruction wrought by the advancing russian forces and international experts mused about the future of the caucasus region but as other topics came to the fore - namely the us presidential election and a certain barack obama - georgia slipped from the headlines .
now events in tbilisi are making news again .
after enjoying a surge of support for his war with russia , carefully spun as a heroic rebuff to the great aggressor , saakashvili has come under increasing pressure from opposition leaders who are now calling for him to resign .
opposition has been growing with many , including some top former allies , accusing saakashvili of mishandling the conflict and betraying the values of the 2003 rose revolution that swept him to power by persecuting critics , stifling the media and concentrating power in his own hands .
observers say that the opposition has a lot of ammunition in their campaign to remove saakashvili .
president faces list of grievances " first of all the economic situation in georgia is not improving , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian / eurasia program at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" it had improved in the first two years after the rose revolution but since then there is very little improvement because there is very little investment in georgia .
secondly , there is still the understanding in the opposition that saakashvili is using authoritarian means to silence them , to prevent them from speaking up and there is still some censorship in georgia .
so all the promises saakashvili made to build a democratic state in georgia have not been fulfilled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the devastation of the war , saakashvili was lauded " thirdly there are the problems of the war in south ossetia and the loss of territory , " rahr added . " after some weeks and months of close solidarity with saakashvili in the aftermath of the war , now the position of people in georgia is to blame him for the war and a situation which could have been avoided . "
the president has attempted to turn the tables on the opposition by claiming to have averted an attempted violent coup and painting the opposition as the stooges in a moscow-backed campaign to overthrow him .
to support this , several opposition supporters were arrested this week on weapons charges as government officials made allegations of plots for attacks .
but claims that the opposition is working with moscow to unseat a man the kremlin sees as a regional irritant loses credibility when one looks deeper at those involved in the campaign against saakashvili .
opposition leaders look to the west " the opposition forces that are on the streets are more pro-western orientated than saakashvili himself , " said alexander rahr .
" the new leader of the georgian protest movement , irakli alasania , is a former ambassador to the un , he has absolutely no connections with russia and some people say that he is the new american candidate for georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the opposition are even more aligned with the west " nino burjanadze of the democratic movement - united georgia party has some diplomatic ties to moscow but she is free of any suspicion of cooperating with russia , " he added .
" davit gamkrelidze , the new co-chairman of the alliance party , is a businessman who fronts the opposition is very connected to the west and not in russia so i think the protests are genuine and they are coming from the position that saakashvili is not a democrat . "
" the protestors are being led by people who want more democracy and prosperity for the country and who are being more supported by the west than by russia , " he said .
however , rahr claims that support for saakashvili is dwindling dramatically in the united states and europe and this is why the opposition believes that he has to go .
they claim he is a danger to the stability and success of georgia on the international scene .
saakashvili 's young , mainly western-educated team came to power blessed by former us president george w. bush as a " beacon of liberty " , but the light has faded and diplomats say barack obama 's administration will be less forgiving .
critics cast doubt on opposition 's ability to govern if georgia is to recover from the war , boost its economy and regain credibility on the world stage , the opposition says , saakashvili has to go .
but what happens if and when saakashvili is replaced ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could irakli alasania and his fellow opponents form a stable coalition government ?
" first of all , saakashvili will not step down so quickly , " rahr said .
" he has survived many of these opposition protests and organized demonstrations against him so let 's see if the opposition is even strong enough to force him into some compromises .
if he topples , if he has to go , the questions arises as to how the various opposition forces can form a coalition government as they are only united , as is often the case in these situations , against the leader , the acting president .
they want him out but this may be the only goal that unites them . "
the problem with the opposition forces , rahr said , is that they are often perceived as being very naïve .
" they have a lot of slogans ; ' let 's have democracy ' , ' let 's build prosperity ' , ' let 's fight corruption ' , ' let 's make the press free ' … but these were the same slogans with which saakashvili came to power in 2003 , " he said . " so how are these forces going to fight corruption , where are they going to get money to rebuild georgia ?
if this opposition comes to power they will have to answer these questions and find a way to restore relations with russia , an economy which is still important to georgia .
they have to normalize relations with other states around georgia and would have to provide a new perspective on georgia 's path towards europe and the united states .
this will all take time so the conclusion to these protests is far from clear . "

for the first time ever , they will need to negotiate with the opposition to find a compromise presidential candidate . moldova 's central electoral commission says the communist party in the former soviet republic has lost its parliamentary majority after sunday 's elections .
official results now give the party of outgoing president vladimir voronin , just 60 out of 101 seats in the new parliament , instead of the initial count of 61 .
the loss of the one seat means that the opposition , with 41 seats , have enough votes to block the naming of a successor to voronin , who must step down after serving two terms in office .
the liberal party and the liberal democratic party each won 15 seats ; the our moldova party secured 11 . thel electoral commission has also agreed to allow opposition parties contesting the polls to check voter lists .
moldovan authorities keep romanian media out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the moldovan capital , chisinau , was rocked by anti-communist demonstrations earlier in the week moldova 's officials have said they will expel three romanian journalists from the former soviet republic .
several press freedom organisations , including reporters without borders and the committee to protect journalists , have also criticized a decision to prevent 19 romanian journalists from entering the country earlier this week to cover tuesday 's riots in the capital , chisinau .
moldovan border guards denied entry to the journalists after accusing bucharest of stoking a coup attempt .
up to 270 people were wounded and almost 200 were arrested during the unrest .
on wednesday , authorities closed the border to romania and expelled the country 's ambassador .
a spokesman for moldova 's interior ministry said that most police forces had left the government district in chisinau and that the situation was again under control .
russian concerns over political divisions moscow has been closely observing the developments in moldova .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov warned the united states against forcing former soviet republics to choose between an alliance with washington and moscow .
lavrov denied that russia was seeking to establish spheres of influence , saying it was not appropriate to compare the violence in moldova with protest movements that brought new leaders to power in other former soviet republics such as ukraine , georgia and kyrgyzstan . wl / ca , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid was announced through the financial markets stabilization fund , soffin , which says it wants 100 percent control of the group . " the offer price of 1.39 euros per hre share represents a premium of approximately 10 percent above the statutory minimum offer price of 1.26 euros , " a soffin statement said .
the offer values hre at about 290 million euros .
that 's about five percent of its value 12 months ago , and a fraction of the 102 billion euros it has received in credit lines and debt guarantees from the government and financial groups after a funding shortage at its irish unit depfa pushed the group to the brink of bankruptcy .
soffin said the takeover offer is aimed at " stabilising the german financial market " , and warned that a collapse of hre would cause economic damage similar to that triggered by the bankruptcy of us investment bank lehman brothers in september .
stressing that the operation was a " voluntary public takeover offer to the shareholders of hypo real estate " , soffin said further details would be released " within the next few days " pending approval by the german stock market regulator bafin .
groundwork for nationalisation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us billionaire christopher flowers does not want to sell his stake in hypo real estate analysts say the move represents another step towards the possible nationalisation of the battered lender .
the government took its first step towards taking control of hre last month when it acquired an 8.7 percent stake in the company for 60 million euros .
a controversial new law signed this week by german president horst koehler allows the government to expropriate shareholders if voluntary efforts to secure stock fail .
that means berlin could seize the shares of us billionaire christopher flowers , who heads an investment consortium that owns almost 24 percent of hre .
flowers has so far been resistant to the government 's takeover plans , saying hypo real estate should receive “ equal treatment ” to other troubled german banks .
following the passage of the law , flowers said he may seek “ legal recourse ” to safeguard the interests of investors . sje / pfd , afp / dpa / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

isfahan 's fmp can also produce nuclear fuel assemblies for the bushehr nuclear power plant , which is a joint project with russia with its first phase scheduled to be completed later this year .
the fmp in isfahan will convert enriched uranium hexafluoride into uranium dioxide -lrb- uo2 -rrb- powder , which is to later be processed into pellet form , tehran 's press tv said on its website .
the pellets will then be stacked into tubes of corrosion-resistant metal alloy called fuel rods .
the finished fuel rods will be assembled together to build up the nuclear fuel core of a power reactor . 7,000 centrifuges at natanz ahmadinejad is also to inspect the natanz uranium enrichment facility near isfahan . atomic chief gholam reza aghazadeh declared that iran has installed around 7,000 centrifuges at its natanz plant .
tehran says that its nuclear program is only for civilian and peaceful purposes , but the west fears that iran might use the same technology for making nuclear weapons .
ahmadinejad has said that iran would be ready for negotiations with the west on allaying fear about its alleged military program .
however , he has rejected international demands that tehran suspend its nuclear enrichment work . on wednesday , the united states said it would join other permanent members of the un security council and germany in talks with iran about its nuclear activities .
this marks a significant shift from former president george w. bush 's position that the us would not enter into talks with iran until it suspended all nuclear activities . nrt / mh send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he tells deutsche welle he 's afraid industrialized nations wo n't keep aid promises . director of the german development institute , dirk messner is a development economist and political scientist whose areas of specialization include globalization , global governance , development policy and international competitiveness . an advisor to the german government and european union , messner spoke to deutsche welle about the effects of the ongoing financial crisis on the developing world . deutsche welle : why does the global financial crisis have such a dramatic impact on developing countries ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : messner has advised the german government on development policy issues dirk messner : there are different channels that link the economic crisis with development processes in developing countries .
the first and most important one is that slower growth in industrialized countries has huge impacts on the export perspectives of developing countries .
many developing countries are very export-oriented and slower growth in developing countries means lower exports for developing countries the second very important element is that the prices for commodities are declining rapidly , and 50 countries around the world depend on the export of a small number of commodity products .
these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , a us crew managed to retake control of a us-flagged ship after pirates hijacked the vessel off the coast of somalia . the german frigate rheinland-pfalz arrived in mombasa on wednesday , where the seven pirates were handed over to the kenyan police , foreign ministry spokesman jens ploetner said .
" we welcome very much the cooperation shown by the kenyan government , " ploetner told reporters in berlin .
greek and spanish forces from the eu 's atalanta anti-piracy mission off the coast of somalia captured the men in the gulf of aden over a week ago .
the pirates had failed to seize the german supply vessel spessart .
the group was then transferred to the frigate rhineland-pfalz .
the pirates are to be tried in kenya as part of an agreement made with the european union last month .
the eu and kenya agreed to transfer to the east african country suspected somali pirates who are detained as part of the atalanta mission .
somalia has not had a functioning legal system for years and would be unable to try the pirates .
initially , it was unclear whether the men would be prosecuted in kenya or flown back to germany , where a court in the city of kiel issued arrest warrants for them .
however , following talks between attorney general amos wako and the german ambassador in nairobi , walter lindner , kenya agreed to take them into custody .
ploetner said the men would appear before a judge on thursday to determine whether they remain in detention .
it was the second group of pirates handed to kenya by the frigate after nine somalis seized in an earlier attack on another german ship were turned over on march 9 .
bildunterschrift : the maersk alabama was carrying food aid to mombasa piracy has started to pick up again off somalia in recent weeks following a lull of several months .
on wednesday , pirates seized the danish-owned container ship maersk alabama with 20 us crew on board in the indian ocean .
meanwhile the us navy destroyer bainbridge has arrived in the stretch of the indian ocean where a us-flagged container ship was hijacked early wednesday , to try and secure the safe release of the ship 's kidnapped captain .
the crew of the maersk alabama re-took control of the vessel from pirates , but captain richard philips remains a captive of the hijackers , now in one of the ship 's lifeboats .
the vessel , which belongs to the us subsidiary of the danish shipping line maersk , was en route to the kenyan port of mombassa when it was commandeered by the pirates .
it is the sixth ship to be seized this week . sac / rm , dpa / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these countries are suffering because the prices for these products are eroding . that means growth is declining in developing countries . how many countries are affected ? the world bank argues that 40 percent of the 107 developing countries we have world wide are heavily affected .
that means the number of the poorest countries worldwide is growing . the numbers are telling us that in 2009 we will see between 50 million and 100 million more people in absolute poverty , that 's people living on less than 1.25 per day . if you add the 150 million people who were affected last year by the food crisis and are part of the world 's poorest people right now we have an additional 250 million very poor people as an effect of the economic crisis that we are muddling through now . if so many people in developing countries are going to be badly affected by the financial crisis , what does that means for their social adhesion and stability ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crisis will be felt well beyond economic markets there is really a risk that the global economic crisis translates to an economic crisis in developing countries because growth is slowing down and these economic problems translate into social problems because unemployment is rising and many more people are living in really poor conditions of a social crisis .
there is a risk that political instability might emerge as the result of social turbulence .
so weak democracies in africa might collapse and we might see even more failing states in southern africa and also in asia . is that well understood by international leaders , like the head of the group of 20 nations who recently met in london ? at the moment we are still in a phase where we are starting to discuss social investments in this crisis to avoid social risks .
we are not currently discussing the political impacts .
i think this discussion will start next year when unemployment and poverty will rise even more in poor countries . huge funds have been allocated by the g20 to help developing countries .
do you think that 's enough to help the poorest countries or will more be needed ? the international monetary fund 's $ 250 billion are credits - not grants - and these credits will be located in countries that have problems with their currency or have trade balance problems .
this is an important investment that the industrialized world is pushing forward . there is another fund for the most vulnerable countries in the developing world to fight poverty .
we are talking - more or less - about $ 50 billion .
i would like to see this money over the next 12 months because we have heard such numbers very often over the last years but we have n't seen the transfers afterwards . do you fear that not enough is going to be done ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industrialized countries have often made large aid promises and not delivered yes .
i really fear that this money will not be transferred .
we heard these numbers at in gleneagles , and so often in g8 meetings and afterward we have n't seen these kinds of transfers . does the current crisis offer any opportunities ? i think that every crisis is a chance and every crisis is a situation of huge change .
crisis does not mean stagnation ; it means many things are happening at the same time .
one of the positive things that we are observing now is the shift from the g8 world , dominated by the industrialized countries , to the g20 world .
that 's very good because now developing countries are taking part in international decision making , and this is very important in a highly interconnected world . we also now have the chance to create the institutional and regulatory framework for the financial markets .
it has not been possible during the past two decades because the united states and the united kingdom did n't what that .
but now we have the chance . we now have options to change processes that we need to fix . who do you think could be the biggest winners and losers when this crisis is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china could be the biggest winner emerging from a new economic world order , says messner i think the most important immediate losers are the most vulnerable developing countries in africa .
in the middle-term if you talk about power structures in the global economy , i would say that the united states is a loser in this crisis .
the united states will be much weaker after this crisis than 20 years ago .
the united states now have a very strong and eloquent leader but the economic situation is much worse than during the clinton era , for example . asia , as a continent , is a winner , and china might be the biggest winner in the restructuring of the global economy if the chinese government would be able to stabilize the country politically and socially . china has n't liberalized financial markets to the extent that other countries have .
could that mean that liberalization is not the best way to go in the future ? what we can learn from china and from other east asian experiences it that a pragmatic approach to a mixed economy of state intervention and markets is very efficient .
countries need to create their own strategies .
china has chosen a very pragmatic approach .
it has a highly efficient , market-based trade sector but it still has very strict control of the financial sector .
this is very comparable with developments we have seen before in taiwan , south korea , singapore and hong kong . it 's not about liberalizing yes or no .
it 's about how to liberalize and about sequencing and not starting on all fronts at the same time .
pragmatism is important and the result might be that we think again about how to organize mixed economies where markets and states find a certain equilibrium . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pass this message on . " after protests turned violent on tuesday , cell phone service in the areas surrounding the demonstrations was not available .
whether disruptions were initiated by authorities to stem protesters ' ability to communicate or if phone networks were overloaded by the massive crowds gathering in the capital of chisinau remains unclear . unfiltered reports bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twitter users flagged their messages with the label # pman but outside of the main protest areas protesters were able to access the internet to post updates on twitter and facebook . messages on thursday said ngos and student groups were planning protests at avram iancu square and linked to youtube videos of demonstrators reporting cases of abuse by the police . using the searchable keyword # pman , named after chisinau 's central square 's romanian name piata marii adunari nationale , twitter postings , called tweets , have flooded the online service so much that the protests have been dubbed the " twitter revolution . " " chisinau surrounded by troops , " a user named robintel posted wednesday on the micro-blogging service twitter .
" people are protesting .
the us said the elections were ok .
not nice . " membership at several groups set up on social networking site facebook have seen membership swell since protests began monday .
one such group titled " support moldova " boasted nearly 7,000 on thursday . decentralized organization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : governments have a difficult time controlling information on facebook and twitter the protests were spearheaded by a committee of activists called " i am an anti-communist " and their size came as a surprise not just to the government but also to mainstream opposition parties that lost sunday 's election . " using the internet we managed to gather 15,000 people on the square in a few minutes , " natalya morar , one of the leaders of the committee , told reporters . twitter and facebook posts , though often not verified by independent sources , are proving to be a major source of information about developing events in chisinau .
some 18 journalists working for romanian and international media were prevented from entering moldova on wednesday , and other romanian journalists were sent back from chisinau airport , according to reporters without borders . wide-spread use of mobile phones and text messaging was seen to be a central element in the success of the 2004 orange revolution in ukraine as well as protests in belarus in 2006 .
internet-based media platforms also provided nearly instantaneous reports from terror attacks in mumbai , the crash landing of a passenger plane in the hudson river near manhattan , and an earthquake in china . but despite the large amount of updates emerging via social media from chisinau , bloggers in eastern europe have also complained about the lack of information getting in . since -lrb- the media -rrb- have no facts to report , they published an article about the social networking aspects of the protests , " wrote kyiv-based , american blogger ann m. merrill .
