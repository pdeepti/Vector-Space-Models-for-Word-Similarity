" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .
schaeuble expressed support for a rigorous discussion about integration .
" that counts for the recognition of the many achievements of immigrants , as well as a serious discussion about the deficits of integration . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heads of various deutsche bahn unions planned to discuss the issue on monday .
the stakes are high for mehdorn .
the powerful executive 's job is reportedly on the line , according to a monday report in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" if the labor representative on the board of directors expresses mistrust , it 's all over for him , " the newspaper said .
bahn said it did n't break the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn says it was trying to stop corruption " mr. mehdorn should apologize as soon as possible to employees , " social democratic party 's peter struck , a supporter of mehdorn , told the television station ard on sunday .
mehdorn has said that neither he , the company 's management or the board of directors knew anything about the affair .
deutsche bahn admitted last week that a security company it had hired vetted some 173,000 rail employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign back in 2002 and 2003 .
deutsche bahn has denied that it was spying on its employees .

" we expect management to inform the workers " who have been spied on , the unions added in a statement released over the weekend .
a company hired by deutsche bahn collected information such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information and compared it with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
the goal of the surveillance was to uncover any areas where bribes could have been paid in exchange for contracts , according to participants at a closed-door meeting of parliament 's transportation committee last week .
apparently , 100 cases of impropriety turned up , although there is no word on whether any employees were found to be corrupt .
the parliamentary transportation committee will meet next week to further discuss the issue .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .
3 .
to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's promised to rebuild the nation 's economy , which collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis . sigurdardottir will serve as iceland 's prime minister until the next round of elections , set for april 25 .
she replaces geir haarde , who stepped down last week after protests over his handling of an economic crisis which has left the island nation near bankruptcy . the 66-year-old sigurdardottir , who is also the world 's first openly gay head of government , has her work cut out for her . " this government 's primary objective will be responsible fiscal control , " she said at a news conference .
" first and foremost , we will focus on urgent matters regarding the businesses and homes of this country . " the coalition of the social democratic alliance and the left-green party said it would stick to the recovery program agreed with the international monetary fund , which came to iceland 's rescue with a $ 10 billion bailout package . government pledges fast action left-green leader steingrimur sigfusson , who will serve as finance minister , will set up a monetary policy commission to make decisions on interest rates , bank reserves and cash requirements , the government said in a statement . it added that it would act quickly to remove central bank bosses , and plan a series of public works projects to boost employment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haarde 's government buckled under the weight of protest over his handling of the financial crisis .
some analysts are already warning that the new government may not be able to make much headway in tackling iceland 's enormous economic problems in the short period until elections in april .
but sigurdardottir 's administration will at least no longer be crippled by the widespread public mistrust which brought down her predecessor . " the major change is maybe that now you have a government that the icelandic people will be inclined to trust , " birgir gudmundsson , professor of media and politics at the university of akureyri told reuters news agency . no word on eu membership the new government has not yet addressed an issue on many people 's minds following iceland 's collapse - namely that of a speedy membership process to join the european union .
that is a question that is expected to be debated in april 's election . the government would only say that both coalition parties agree that membership in the eu could only be decided on the basis of a national referendum . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in bremen a weakened bremen side who were missing star midfielder diego and striker claudio pizarro through suspension , as well as several other injured players , went behind in the 24th minute as thorben marx slipped the ball past goalkeeper tim wiese .
portuguese striker hugo almeida grabbed an equalizer a minute from the break with a well-taken free-kick and bremen fans were hoping for a much better performance in the second half from their side , but they were to be disappointed .
weak bremen hit by loss of confidence , injuries the bremen defence , where coach thomas schaaf had to replace four injured players , looked weak and it was a bremen mistake that gifted bielefeld their second goal four minutes after the restart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was just one of bremen 's under-performers bremen captain torsten frings unnecessarily lost the ball in his own half to zambian christopher katongo , who passed the ball into the middle where artur wichniarek was on hand to score his 11th of the season .
bremen enjoyed more of the possession throughout the second half - as they did in the first - but failed to create any real opportunities to score a second goal against a team that they had managed to beat 8-1 at home last season .
bielefeld coach michael frontzeck complimented his side after the win .
" we really fought well .
i think at the end of the day we deserved the victory because of our effort .
" the best thing is that hopefully this will put an end to all this discussion about us not having won a game away from home for 63 matches . "
wichniarek said that his side could not be expected to go into a game in bremen playing offensive football .

the eu has welcomed the decision but has said its sanctions on harare would remain in place . the decision by zimbabwe 's longtime opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on friday to go into government with president robert mugabe zanu-pf , ending the party 's nearly five-month campaign for a more equitable power-sharing deal , was welcomed by the european union late sunday but the eu warned that it would judged on what actions it takes .
" i welcome the agreement reached by the zimbabwean parties , in particular to establish the government of national unity , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement , adding that " the government of national unity will be judged by its actions . "
" i call on all parties to comply in good faith with the agreement reached .
only in the context of an equitable political solution , the plight of the zimbabwean people can be alleviated , " he said .
the mdc 's national council ratified the move to implement a september power-sharing accord signed by mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai , despite previous misgivings within the party about the skewed nature of the deal .
despite welcoming the deal , the eu refused to comment on calls from the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and continental giant south africa called for the united states and europe to lift sanctions on zimbabwean president robert mugabe 's regime .
eu crackdown on zimbabwean assets set to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana and the eu will wait before making a decision eu foreign ministers last week tightened sanctions on zimbabwe , freezing the assets of companies based in british tax havens for the first time and adding 26 more names of people close to the mugabe regime or their families to a travel-ban list , bringing the number to 203 .
the number of companies whose assets in europe must be frozen was increased sharply from four to 40 and for the first time european-based firms are included .
according to eu sources , all 18 of the european company names added are based on british territory , including tax havens jersey , the isle of man and the british virgin islands .
a spokesman for the eu 's czech presidency said sunday that any lifting of sanctions could only be decided by the ministers and recalled that their next meeting in brussels is set for february 23 .
the au 's executive council adopted a resolution ahead of the three-day african union summit in the ethiopian capital addis ababa sunday , calling for " the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe to help ease the humanitarian situation in the country . "
au calls on action to help zimbabwe recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au calls on international help to aid zimbabwe african union head jean ping , when asked about sanctions levied by the united states and european union , said : " i think that everybody today should help zimbabwe to rebuild its economy , because an agreement has been reached . "
since disputed elections in march 2008 , zimbabwe 's shattered economy has nosedived further .
it has the world 's highest inflation rate - 231 million percent - and is struggling with a cholera epidemic that has claimed some 3,000 lives .
ping said : " imagine that you do n't help zimbabwe , who will be blamed ?
everybody is expecting that today , because tsvangirai is going to lead the economy and everything , that the economy should recover .
so if you do n't do that , who will be blamed by the population ? "
us , uk skeptical of unity agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe have been sparring for months commenting on the deal reached between zanu pf and the mdc , us state department acting spokesman robert wood said : " i 've seen the reports about this agreement , but as you can understand , we are a bit skeptical .
these types of things have been announced before .
the key is always implementation . "
an equally tempered reaction emerged from london , where british foreign secretary david miliband said he looked forward to seeing details of a deal that would hold zimbabwean lawmakers accountable .
" the new government will be judged on its actions , above all by the people of zimbabwe , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's promised to rebuild the nation 's economy , which collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis . sigurdardottir will serve as iceland 's prime minister until the next round of elections , set for april 25 .
she replaces geir haarde , who stepped down last week after protests over his handling of an economic crisis which has left the island nation near bankruptcy . the 66-year-old sigurdardottir , who is also the world 's first openly gay head of government , has her work cut out for her . " this government 's primary objective will be responsible fiscal control , " she said at a news conference .
" first and foremost , we will focus on urgent matters regarding the businesses and homes of this country . " the coalition of the social democratic alliance and the left-green party said it would stick to the recovery program agreed with the international monetary fund , which came to iceland 's rescue with a $ 10 billion bailout package . government pledges fast action left-green leader steingrimur sigfusson , who will serve as finance minister , will set up a monetary policy commission to make decisions on interest rates , bank reserves and cash requirements , the government said in a statement . it added that it would act quickly to remove central bank bosses , and plan a series of public works projects to boost employment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haarde 's government buckled under the weight of protest over his handling of the financial crisis .
some analysts are already warning that the new government may not be able to make much headway in tackling iceland 's enormous economic problems in the short period until elections in april .
but sigurdardottir 's administration will at least no longer be crippled by the widespread public mistrust which brought down her predecessor . " the major change is maybe that now you have a government that the icelandic people will be inclined to trust , " birgir gudmundsson , professor of media and politics at the university of akureyri told reuters news agency . no word on eu membership the new government has not yet addressed an issue on many people 's minds following iceland 's collapse - namely that of a speedy membership process to join the european union .
that is a question that is expected to be debated in april 's election . the government would only say that both coalition parties agree that membership in the eu could only be decided on the basis of a national referendum . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .

" the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .
2 .
" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .
1 , to highlight the possibility of attacks on germany .
the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .
nearly 75 percent of those surveyed in sunday 's poll said the government was handling the economy poorly .
around 56 percent said they expected the government would be forced into a general election this year .

abbas is also pushing for a role in rebuilding the war-shattered gaza strip , controlled by hamas . sarkozy also held talks with newly appointed us middle east envoy george mitchell and qatar 's prime minister on monday , seeking to boost prospects for reviving israeli-arab peace talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell , left , seen here with abbas , is testing the waters in the middle east the 75-year-old former us senator said in israel friday that washington was committed to " actively and aggressively " seeking lasting peace in the middle east but warned there would be further setbacks . earlier , qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani too met sarkozy in paris .

abbas is also pushing for a role in rebuilding the war-shattered gaza strip , controlled by hamas . sarkozy also held talks with newly appointed us middle east envoy george mitchell and qatar 's prime minister on monday , seeking to boost prospects for reviving israeli-arab peace talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell , left , seen here with abbas , is testing the waters in the middle east the 75-year-old former us senator said in israel friday that washington was committed to " actively and aggressively " seeking lasting peace in the middle east but warned there would be further setbacks . earlier , qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani too met sarkozy in paris .
after the talks , sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani said he supported a national unity government for the palestinians and that arab countries should unite to support a palestinian solution . " arab countries can not support one palestinian faction against another , " said the prime minister , who is also foreign minister of the gulf state that brokered a peace accord for lebanon last year . " these disagreements complicate palestinian efforts to succeed in forming a government , " he told reporters . scattered violence strains truce the latest diplomatic drive in paris comes as renewed violence between israelis and palestinians threatens to shatter the shaky ceasefire in gaza . palestinian residents of rafah , a town in the south of the gaza strip , said that israeli f-16 warplanes dropped at least four large bombs sunday night in their efforts to destroy the tunnels , used for smuggling goods and arms into gaza from egypt .

" it is not our intention to have an operation cast lead 2 , " he said in an interview with the ynet news web site .
israel 's 22-day offensive in gaza before a ceasefire last month had been known as " operation cast lead " .
" we said there would be a response and there was a response last night , " barak said about sunday 's air strikes .
but on monday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni struck a tough note , vowing that each rocket attack would be countered .
" we will continue to strike at hamas .
and our strategic goal can not be to accept their existence , " livni said in speech .
" if a deterrence has not been achieved at the end of the campaign , we will continue to do so until they get the message , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is hoping to be israel 's next prime minister " we will respond to every attack , every shooting at israel , every attack on israeli sovereignty and continue to take action if there is a need , " she added .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .

she announced her plans in her weekend video address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prevention is better than a cure , says merkel merkel is seeking to improve financial transparency and has called for stricter supervision of the global finance industry .
at the world economic forum in davos on friday , she called for an international economic body to be set up , charged with the task of preventing rather than reacting to crises . " this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the -lrb- un -rrb- security council was created after the second world war , " she said . sarkozy 's office denies report of extra meeting at the same time , the french daily le monde reported in its sunday edition that sarkozy is calling for an extraordinary meeting of eurozone countries .
sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .
31 , 2008 , when the czech republic took over the rotating presidency .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a simple " sorry " from bahn ceo mehdorn wo n't cut it , kirchner told info radio on monday , feb .
2 . the unions want to understand in detail exactly what happened and who was responsible , kirchner said .
the heads of various deutsche bahn unions planned to discuss the issue on monday .
the stakes are high for mehdorn .
the powerful executive 's job is reportedly on the line , according to a monday report in the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
" if the labor representative on the board of directors expresses mistrust , it 's all over for him , " the newspaper said .
bahn said it did n't break the law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn says it was trying to stop corruption " mr. mehdorn should apologize as soon as possible to employees , " social democratic party 's peter struck , a supporter of mehdorn , told the television station ard on sunday .
mehdorn has said that neither he , the company 's management or the board of directors knew anything about the affair .
deutsche bahn admitted last week that a security company it had hired vetted some 173,000 rail employees as part of an anti-corruption campaign back in 2002 and 2003 .
deutsche bahn has denied that it was spying on its employees .
" contrary to many assertions , there is nothing wrong with comparing employee and supplier addresses , or so-called ' screening ' , regardless of the number of vetted employees , " said deutsche bahn spokesperson oliver schumacher said last week .
union , politicians want answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unions want more than a mere apology from mehdorn transnet and gdba unions have criticized the company for not providing clear explanations .
in a joint statement , the unions called on deutsche bahn to give a more detailed account at a special board meeting .
" we expect management to inform the workers " who have been spied on , the unions added in a statement released over the weekend .
a company hired by deutsche bahn collected information such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information and compared it with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
the goal of the surveillance was to uncover any areas where bribes could have been paid in exchange for contracts , according to participants at a closed-door meeting of parliament 's transportation committee last week .
apparently , 100 cases of impropriety turned up , although there is no word on whether any employees were found to be corrupt .
the parliamentary transportation committee will meet next week to further discuss the issue .
some politicians have voiced concerns that deutsche bahn was illegally trying to pinpoint those employees who were critical of the company . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in bremen a weakened bremen side who were missing star midfielder diego and striker claudio pizarro through suspension , as well as several other injured players , went behind in the 24th minute as thorben marx slipped the ball past goalkeeper tim wiese .
portuguese striker hugo almeida grabbed an equalizer a minute from the break with a well-taken free-kick and bremen fans were hoping for a much better performance in the second half from their side , but they were to be disappointed .
weak bremen hit by loss of confidence , injuries the bremen defence , where coach thomas schaaf had to replace four injured players , looked weak and it was a bremen mistake that gifted bielefeld their second goal four minutes after the restart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was just one of bremen 's under-performers bremen captain torsten frings unnecessarily lost the ball in his own half to zambian christopher katongo , who passed the ball into the middle where artur wichniarek was on hand to score his 11th of the season .
bremen enjoyed more of the possession throughout the second half - as they did in the first - but failed to create any real opportunities to score a second goal against a team that they had managed to beat 8-1 at home last season .
bielefeld coach michael frontzeck complimented his side after the win .
" we really fought well .
i think at the end of the day we deserved the victory because of our effort .
" the best thing is that hopefully this will put an end to all this discussion about us not having won a game away from home for 63 matches . "
wichniarek said that his side could not be expected to go into a game in bremen playing offensive football .
" bremen is a good side , you have to make your game from the back and we did that .
we stood firm at the back and i think that made the difference . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .

german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .

germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .

" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .

abbas is also pushing for a role in rebuilding the war-shattered gaza strip , controlled by hamas . sarkozy also held talks with newly appointed us middle east envoy george mitchell and qatar 's prime minister on monday , seeking to boost prospects for reviving israeli-arab peace talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell , left , seen here with abbas , is testing the waters in the middle east the 75-year-old former us senator said in israel friday that washington was committed to " actively and aggressively " seeking lasting peace in the middle east but warned there would be further setbacks . earlier , qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani too met sarkozy in paris .
after the talks , sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani said he supported a national unity government for the palestinians and that arab countries should unite to support a palestinian solution . " arab countries can not support one palestinian faction against another , " said the prime minister , who is also foreign minister of the gulf state that brokered a peace accord for lebanon last year . " these disagreements complicate palestinian efforts to succeed in forming a government , " he told reporters . scattered violence strains truce the latest diplomatic drive in paris comes as renewed violence between israelis and palestinians threatens to shatter the shaky ceasefire in gaza . palestinian residents of rafah , a town in the south of the gaza strip , said that israeli f-16 warplanes dropped at least four large bombs sunday night in their efforts to destroy the tunnels , used for smuggling goods and arms into gaza from egypt .

" it is not our intention to have an operation cast lead 2 , " he said in an interview with the ynet news web site .
israel 's 22-day offensive in gaza before a ceasefire last month had been known as " operation cast lead " .
" we said there would be a response and there was a response last night , " barak said about sunday 's air strikes .
but on monday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni struck a tough note , vowing that each rocket attack would be countered .
" we will continue to strike at hamas .
and our strategic goal can not be to accept their existence , " livni said in speech .
" if a deterrence has not been achieved at the end of the campaign , we will continue to do so until they get the message , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is hoping to be israel 's next prime minister " we will respond to every attack , every shooting at israel , every attack on israeli sovereignty and continue to take action if there is a need , " she added .

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .
schaeuble expressed support for a rigorous discussion about integration .
" that counts for the recognition of the many achievements of immigrants , as well as a serious discussion about the deficits of integration . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de study shows turkish immigrants least integrated in germany a new study published on monday shows that turks are the least integrated group of immigrants in german society and are also less successful than immigrants from other countries in securing a job in germany .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .
nearly 75 percent of those surveyed in sunday 's poll said the government was handling the economy poorly .

2 . last year , economists had feared that consumer spending would continue its free-fall into january off the back of poor figures for the last quarter in 2008 . but sentiment among german shoppers defied this expectation as falling energy prices and low inflation buoyed consumer expenditure . by the end of january , germany had exceeded the european average for consumer spending . the gfk economic research group forecast spending would increase by 0.5 percent in 2009 despite the global economic slowdown .
the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site . " the effects of the financial and economic crisis have yet to reach consumers , and consumer mood has proven incredibly resilient in recent months , " the group added . low inflation gfk said it expected inflation to remain very low , and added this would strengthen german consumers ' purchasing power . " since crude oil prices and with them , gas and heating oil prices peaked in september 2008 and then started falling rapidly , the rate of inflation has also gone down considerably , " said rolf buerkl , a senior research consultant at gfk . " although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said . " consumers will be feeling the impact of the crisis far more over the coming months and will have to adjust their daily habits and attitudes accordingly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 02.02.2009 analysis : german anger at pope 's pardon of bishop continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's reversal of the excommunication is seen by many germans as a major error the outrage over the decision by pope benedict xvi to readmit to the church a conservative bishop , known for his denial of the holocaust , is showing no signs of abating in the pontiff 's native germany . the pope 's decision to release from excommunication four ultra-conservative bishops who run the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- was intended as an act of reconciliation within the catholic church .
but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de criticism of pope 's rehabilitation of holocaust denier grows a second german catholic bishop saturday raised unusual criticism of german pope benedict xvi for rehabilitating holocaust denier bishop williamson , adding his objections to the pope 's ultraconservative direction .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .
nearly 75 percent of those surveyed in sunday 's poll said the government was handling the economy poorly .
around 56 percent said they expected the government would be forced into a general election this year .

but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .

the eu has welcomed the decision but has said its sanctions on harare would remain in place . the decision by zimbabwe 's longtime opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on friday to go into government with president robert mugabe zanu-pf , ending the party 's nearly five-month campaign for a more equitable power-sharing deal , was welcomed by the european union late sunday but the eu warned that it would judged on what actions it takes .
" i welcome the agreement reached by the zimbabwean parties , in particular to establish the government of national unity , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement , adding that " the government of national unity will be judged by its actions . "
" i call on all parties to comply in good faith with the agreement reached .
only in the context of an equitable political solution , the plight of the zimbabwean people can be alleviated , " he said .
the mdc 's national council ratified the move to implement a september power-sharing accord signed by mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai , despite previous misgivings within the party about the skewed nature of the deal .
despite welcoming the deal , the eu refused to comment on calls from the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and continental giant south africa called for the united states and europe to lift sanctions on zimbabwean president robert mugabe 's regime .
eu crackdown on zimbabwean assets set to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana and the eu will wait before making a decision eu foreign ministers last week tightened sanctions on zimbabwe , freezing the assets of companies based in british tax havens for the first time and adding 26 more names of people close to the mugabe regime or their families to a travel-ban list , bringing the number to 203 .
the number of companies whose assets in europe must be frozen was increased sharply from four to 40 and for the first time european-based firms are included .
according to eu sources , all 18 of the european company names added are based on british territory , including tax havens jersey , the isle of man and the british virgin islands .
a spokesman for the eu 's czech presidency said sunday that any lifting of sanctions could only be decided by the ministers and recalled that their next meeting in brussels is set for february 23 .
the au 's executive council adopted a resolution ahead of the three-day african union summit in the ethiopian capital addis ababa sunday , calling for " the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe to help ease the humanitarian situation in the country . "
au calls on action to help zimbabwe recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au calls on international help to aid zimbabwe african union head jean ping , when asked about sanctions levied by the united states and european union , said : " i think that everybody today should help zimbabwe to rebuild its economy , because an agreement has been reached . "
since disputed elections in march 2008 , zimbabwe 's shattered economy has nosedived further .
it has the world 's highest inflation rate - 231 million percent - and is struggling with a cholera epidemic that has claimed some 3,000 lives .
ping said : " imagine that you do n't help zimbabwe , who will be blamed ?
everybody is expecting that today , because tsvangirai is going to lead the economy and everything , that the economy should recover .
so if you do n't do that , who will be blamed by the population ? "
us , uk skeptical of unity agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe have been sparring for months commenting on the deal reached between zanu pf and the mdc , us state department acting spokesman robert wood said : " i 've seen the reports about this agreement , but as you can understand , we are a bit skeptical .
these types of things have been announced before .
the key is always implementation . "
an equally tempered reaction emerged from london , where british foreign secretary david miliband said he looked forward to seeing details of a deal that would hold zimbabwean lawmakers accountable .

it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.02.2009 german government considers bank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't want hypo real estate to go bankrupt the german government is considering a controversial plan to nationalize hypo real estate .
it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .

it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .

german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .

but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .

" xenophobia and racism are serious concerns for us , " germany 's deputy foreign minister gernot erler said before the human rights council . since the introduction in 2007 of the un 's universal period review program , set up by the human rights council , each country 's rights record is supposed to be checked once every four years . berlin came under criticism for problems related to the integration of immigrant children and the well-being of asylum seekers . the german delegation to the review said steps were being taken , costing hundreds of millions of euros , to integrate immigrants , and that schools would no longer report undocumented children , making it easier for them to receive education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says it 's working to improve integration about 18 percent of people living in germany are first or second generation immigrants . the salary gap between men and women was also raised at the review , but erler said this was mostly a private sector issue . additionally , human rights groups said germany had been too complacent during the us-led " war on terror " and let people pass through its territory en route to being tortured in other countries . erler also said that by 2020 , germany planned to dedicate 0.7 percent of its gdp to foreign development aid - the target amount set by the un for developed countries . human rights groups , however , said the report did not take the situation in germany seriously enough .

" mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de criticism of pope 's rehabilitation of holocaust denier grows a second german catholic bishop saturday raised unusual criticism of german pope benedict xvi for rehabilitating holocaust denier bishop williamson , adding his objections to the pope 's ultraconservative direction .

the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .

hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .

she 's promised to rebuild the nation 's economy , which collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis . sigurdardottir will serve as iceland 's prime minister until the next round of elections , set for april 25 .
she replaces geir haarde , who stepped down last week after protests over his handling of an economic crisis which has left the island nation near bankruptcy . the 66-year-old sigurdardottir , who is also the world 's first openly gay head of government , has her work cut out for her . " this government 's primary objective will be responsible fiscal control , " she said at a news conference .
" first and foremost , we will focus on urgent matters regarding the businesses and homes of this country . " the coalition of the social democratic alliance and the left-green party said it would stick to the recovery program agreed with the international monetary fund , which came to iceland 's rescue with a $ 10 billion bailout package . government pledges fast action left-green leader steingrimur sigfusson , who will serve as finance minister , will set up a monetary policy commission to make decisions on interest rates , bank reserves and cash requirements , the government said in a statement . it added that it would act quickly to remove central bank bosses , and plan a series of public works projects to boost employment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haarde 's government buckled under the weight of protest over his handling of the financial crisis .
some analysts are already warning that the new government may not be able to make much headway in tackling iceland 's enormous economic problems in the short period until elections in april .
but sigurdardottir 's administration will at least no longer be crippled by the widespread public mistrust which brought down her predecessor . " the major change is maybe that now you have a government that the icelandic people will be inclined to trust , " birgir gudmundsson , professor of media and politics at the university of akureyri told reuters news agency . no word on eu membership the new government has not yet addressed an issue on many people 's minds following iceland 's collapse - namely that of a speedy membership process to join the european union .
that is a question that is expected to be debated in april 's election . the government would only say that both coalition parties agree that membership in the eu could only be decided on the basis of a national referendum . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she announced her plans in her weekend video address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prevention is better than a cure , says merkel merkel is seeking to improve financial transparency and has called for stricter supervision of the global finance industry .
at the world economic forum in davos on friday , she called for an international economic body to be set up , charged with the task of preventing rather than reacting to crises . " this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the -lrb- un -rrb- security council was created after the second world war , " she said . sarkozy 's office denies report of extra meeting at the same time , the french daily le monde reported in its sunday edition that sarkozy is calling for an extraordinary meeting of eurozone countries .
sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .

bremen enjoyed more of the possession throughout the second half - as they did in the first - but failed to create any real opportunities to score a second goal against a team that they had managed to beat 8-1 at home last season .
bielefeld coach michael frontzeck complimented his side after the win .
" we really fought well .

2 . last year , economists had feared that consumer spending would continue its free-fall into january off the back of poor figures for the last quarter in 2008 . but sentiment among german shoppers defied this expectation as falling energy prices and low inflation buoyed consumer expenditure . by the end of january , germany had exceeded the european average for consumer spending . the gfk economic research group forecast spending would increase by 0.5 percent in 2009 despite the global economic slowdown .
the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site . " the effects of the financial and economic crisis have yet to reach consumers , and consumer mood has proven incredibly resilient in recent months , " the group added . low inflation gfk said it expected inflation to remain very low , and added this would strengthen german consumers ' purchasing power . " since crude oil prices and with them , gas and heating oil prices peaked in september 2008 and then started falling rapidly , the rate of inflation has also gone down considerably , " said rolf buerkl , a senior research consultant at gfk . " although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said . " consumers will be feeling the impact of the crisis far more over the coming months and will have to adjust their daily habits and attitudes accordingly .

the eu has welcomed the decision but has said its sanctions on harare would remain in place . the decision by zimbabwe 's longtime opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on friday to go into government with president robert mugabe zanu-pf , ending the party 's nearly five-month campaign for a more equitable power-sharing deal , was welcomed by the european union late sunday but the eu warned that it would judged on what actions it takes .
" i welcome the agreement reached by the zimbabwean parties , in particular to establish the government of national unity , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement , adding that " the government of national unity will be judged by its actions . "
" i call on all parties to comply in good faith with the agreement reached .
only in the context of an equitable political solution , the plight of the zimbabwean people can be alleviated , " he said .
the mdc 's national council ratified the move to implement a september power-sharing accord signed by mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai , despite previous misgivings within the party about the skewed nature of the deal .
despite welcoming the deal , the eu refused to comment on calls from the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and continental giant south africa called for the united states and europe to lift sanctions on zimbabwean president robert mugabe 's regime .
eu crackdown on zimbabwean assets set to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana and the eu will wait before making a decision eu foreign ministers last week tightened sanctions on zimbabwe , freezing the assets of companies based in british tax havens for the first time and adding 26 more names of people close to the mugabe regime or their families to a travel-ban list , bringing the number to 203 .
the number of companies whose assets in europe must be frozen was increased sharply from four to 40 and for the first time european-based firms are included .
according to eu sources , all 18 of the european company names added are based on british territory , including tax havens jersey , the isle of man and the british virgin islands .
a spokesman for the eu 's czech presidency said sunday that any lifting of sanctions could only be decided by the ministers and recalled that their next meeting in brussels is set for february 23 .
the au 's executive council adopted a resolution ahead of the three-day african union summit in the ethiopian capital addis ababa sunday , calling for " the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe to help ease the humanitarian situation in the country . "
au calls on action to help zimbabwe recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au calls on international help to aid zimbabwe african union head jean ping , when asked about sanctions levied by the united states and european union , said : " i think that everybody today should help zimbabwe to rebuild its economy , because an agreement has been reached . "
since disputed elections in march 2008 , zimbabwe 's shattered economy has nosedived further .
it has the world 's highest inflation rate - 231 million percent - and is struggling with a cholera epidemic that has claimed some 3,000 lives .
ping said : " imagine that you do n't help zimbabwe , who will be blamed ?
everybody is expecting that today , because tsvangirai is going to lead the economy and everything , that the economy should recover .
so if you do n't do that , who will be blamed by the population ? "
us , uk skeptical of unity agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe have been sparring for months commenting on the deal reached between zanu pf and the mdc , us state department acting spokesman robert wood said : " i 've seen the reports about this agreement , but as you can understand , we are a bit skeptical .
these types of things have been announced before .
the key is always implementation . "
an equally tempered reaction emerged from london , where british foreign secretary david miliband said he looked forward to seeing details of a deal that would hold zimbabwean lawmakers accountable .
" the new government will be judged on its actions , above all by the people of zimbabwe , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 . last year , economists had feared that consumer spending would continue its free-fall into january off the back of poor figures for the last quarter in 2008 . but sentiment among german shoppers defied this expectation as falling energy prices and low inflation buoyed consumer expenditure . by the end of january , germany had exceeded the european average for consumer spending . the gfk economic research group forecast spending would increase by 0.5 percent in 2009 despite the global economic slowdown .
the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site . " the effects of the financial and economic crisis have yet to reach consumers , and consumer mood has proven incredibly resilient in recent months , " the group added . low inflation gfk said it expected inflation to remain very low , and added this would strengthen german consumers ' purchasing power . " since crude oil prices and with them , gas and heating oil prices peaked in september 2008 and then started falling rapidly , the rate of inflation has also gone down considerably , " said rolf buerkl , a senior research consultant at gfk . " although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said . " consumers will be feeling the impact of the crisis far more over the coming months and will have to adjust their daily habits and attitudes accordingly .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abbas is also pushing for a role in rebuilding the war-shattered gaza strip , controlled by hamas . sarkozy also held talks with newly appointed us middle east envoy george mitchell and qatar 's prime minister on monday , seeking to boost prospects for reviving israeli-arab peace talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell , left , seen here with abbas , is testing the waters in the middle east the 75-year-old former us senator said in israel friday that washington was committed to " actively and aggressively " seeking lasting peace in the middle east but warned there would be further setbacks . earlier , qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani too met sarkozy in paris .
after the talks , sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani said he supported a national unity government for the palestinians and that arab countries should unite to support a palestinian solution . " arab countries can not support one palestinian faction against another , " said the prime minister , who is also foreign minister of the gulf state that brokered a peace accord for lebanon last year . " these disagreements complicate palestinian efforts to succeed in forming a government , " he told reporters . scattered violence strains truce the latest diplomatic drive in paris comes as renewed violence between israelis and palestinians threatens to shatter the shaky ceasefire in gaza . palestinian residents of rafah , a town in the south of the gaza strip , said that israeli f-16 warplanes dropped at least four large bombs sunday night in their efforts to destroy the tunnels , used for smuggling goods and arms into gaza from egypt .
no injuries were reported in the attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an egyptian officer guards the egypt-rafah border suspected to be used by hamas to smuggle weapons into gaza witnesses said earlier that israeli f-16s also conducted missile attacks on an empty hamas police post in central gaza .
no injuries were reported in the strikes , though the compound was said to be completely destroyed . the israeli airstrike came shortly after around eight qassam rockets were launched from gaza on jewish settlements across the border in israel .
the israeli government said one civilian and two soldiers were injured in the attacks , news agency afp reported . israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged on sunday a " disproportionate " military response to continuing rocket attacks that palestinian militants have described as payback for fresh israeli attacks . livni talks tough but israeli defence minister ehud barak said israel would stop short of all-out war .
" it is not our intention to have an operation cast lead 2 , " he said in an interview with the ynet news web site .
israel 's 22-day offensive in gaza before a ceasefire last month had been known as " operation cast lead " .
" we said there would be a response and there was a response last night , " barak said about sunday 's air strikes .
but on monday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni struck a tough note , vowing that each rocket attack would be countered .
" we will continue to strike at hamas .
and our strategic goal can not be to accept their existence , " livni said in speech .
" if a deterrence has not been achieved at the end of the campaign , we will continue to do so until they get the message , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is hoping to be israel 's next prime minister " we will respond to every attack , every shooting at israel , every attack on israeli sovereignty and continue to take action if there is a need , " she added .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .

2 . last year , economists had feared that consumer spending would continue its free-fall into january off the back of poor figures for the last quarter in 2008 . but sentiment among german shoppers defied this expectation as falling energy prices and low inflation buoyed consumer expenditure . by the end of january , germany had exceeded the european average for consumer spending . the gfk economic research group forecast spending would increase by 0.5 percent in 2009 despite the global economic slowdown .
the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site . " the effects of the financial and economic crisis have yet to reach consumers , and consumer mood has proven incredibly resilient in recent months , " the group added . low inflation gfk said it expected inflation to remain very low , and added this would strengthen german consumers ' purchasing power . " since crude oil prices and with them , gas and heating oil prices peaked in september 2008 and then started falling rapidly , the rate of inflation has also gone down considerably , " said rolf buerkl , a senior research consultant at gfk . " although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said . " consumers will be feeling the impact of the crisis far more over the coming months and will have to adjust their daily habits and attitudes accordingly .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .
nearly 75 percent of those surveyed in sunday 's poll said the government was handling the economy poorly .
around 56 percent said they expected the government would be forced into a general election this year .

a full 78 percent said they favor protectionist measures , according to a study released sunday , feb .
1 . these measures include tariffs and quotas for imports .
trade-restricting policies are used to protect domestic businesses and workers over foreign competition .
protectionism goes against the tenets free trade , which is where governments strive to keep trade regulations to a minimum . only one year ago , the support for protectionist measures was at a much lower 43 percent , according to the global accounting firm ernst & young , which conducted the study . more than nine out of 10 also said that greater public investment " would noticeably strengthen the country 's small and medium-sized companies , " a contrast to 69 percent a year earlier . financial crisis making itself felt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of german companies said they notice the effects of the financial crisis about half of the 3,000 companies that participated in the study said the global financial crisis had hurt businesses , mainly by creating a decrease in demand .

but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .
2 .
" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .
1 , to highlight the possibility of attacks on germany .
the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

2 . last year , economists had feared that consumer spending would continue its free-fall into january off the back of poor figures for the last quarter in 2008 . but sentiment among german shoppers defied this expectation as falling energy prices and low inflation buoyed consumer expenditure . by the end of january , germany had exceeded the european average for consumer spending . the gfk economic research group forecast spending would increase by 0.5 percent in 2009 despite the global economic slowdown .
the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site .

" although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said .

11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .

the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

" freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .

the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .
2 .
" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .

the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 02.02.2009 analysis : german anger at pope 's pardon of bishop continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's reversal of the excommunication is seen by many germans as a major error the outrage over the decision by pope benedict xvi to readmit to the church a conservative bishop , known for his denial of the holocaust , is showing no signs of abating in the pontiff 's native germany . the pope 's decision to release from excommunication four ultra-conservative bishops who run the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- was intended as an act of reconciliation within the catholic church .
but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de criticism of pope 's rehabilitation of holocaust denier grows a second german catholic bishop saturday raised unusual criticism of german pope benedict xvi for rehabilitating holocaust denier bishop williamson , adding his objections to the pope 's ultraconservative direction .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .

" in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .
2 .
" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .
1 , to highlight the possibility of attacks on germany .
the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .

numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .

the organization said that the consumer climate index rose from 1.6 points last september to 2.2 points in january 2009 . " the level of unemployment is not expected to affect consumption until the end of the year and so consequently , consumers are unlikely to experience much of a crisis this year , " the group said in a statement on its web site .

" since crude oil prices and with them , gas and heating oil prices peaked in september 2008 and then started falling rapidly , the rate of inflation has also gone down considerably , " said rolf buerkl , a senior research consultant at gfk . " although the relief package now adopted will not be able to prevent the current crisis , it may stabilize the economy and the labor market and , accordingly , mitigate the recession and fear of unemployment . but predictions for spending into 2010 are n't so upbeat , gfk said .

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .
2 .
" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .
1 , to highlight the possibility of attacks on germany .
the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 02.02.2009 analysis : german anger at pope 's pardon of bishop continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's reversal of the excommunication is seen by many germans as a major error the outrage over the decision by pope benedict xvi to readmit to the church a conservative bishop , known for his denial of the holocaust , is showing no signs of abating in the pontiff 's native germany . the pope 's decision to release from excommunication four ultra-conservative bishops who run the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- was intended as an act of reconciliation within the catholic church .
but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .
the german headquarters of the sspx congregation is located in a town in his diocese . fuerst said it had caused " alienation from the church on the part of many believers , a loss of trust in the church ... and a considerable breakdown in the judaeo-christian dialogue . " the bishop of the pope 's native regensburg has declared williamson persona non grata , and theologians in the cities of muenster and tuebingen have expressed their dismay .
seasoned vatican watchers have been left wondering over what most agree is a public relations blunder by the vatican . vatican ' out of touch ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : benedict 's papacy is it risk of being viewed as out of touch " the benign explanation is that there exists a difficulty in correctly communicating vatican decisions , " said author massimo franco who has recently written a book on the history of the holy see 's diplomatic relations . alternatively , franco suggests the vatican has shown it is " out of touch " with current events , leaving it vulnerable to criticism . swiss-born theologian hans kueng has called for a change in direction , away from " the constant promotion of the extreme right . "
he has said the pope " is increasingly aloof from the people .
he does n't hear a thing in his ' kingdom . " ' the pope 's decision saturday to name an ultraconservative austrian priest as auxiliary bishop seems to confirm this opinion . the designated bishop , gerhard wagner , has previously condemned harry potter books for their " satanist " content , and suggested in 2005 that hurricane katrina was a punishment sent by god , as it destroyed five abortion clinics . controversial bishop apologizes williamson has written a letter apologizing to the pontiff for the " distress and problems " caused by his holocaust-denying remarks , but he has yet to retract them . the reinstated sspx bishops are part of a schism which formed when archbishop marcel lefebvre rejected the process of liberalization put in place during the vatican council of 1962-65 . in 1988 , lefebvre , disobeying orders by pope john paul ii , consecrated the four men as bishops , in a move which led to the excommunication of lefevbre and the bishops . the vatican estimates that sspx has around 600,000 members in the world , while 1.1 billion people are described as roman catholics . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she 's promised to rebuild the nation 's economy , which collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis . sigurdardottir will serve as iceland 's prime minister until the next round of elections , set for april 25 .
she replaces geir haarde , who stepped down last week after protests over his handling of an economic crisis which has left the island nation near bankruptcy . the 66-year-old sigurdardottir , who is also the world 's first openly gay head of government , has her work cut out for her . " this government 's primary objective will be responsible fiscal control , " she said at a news conference .
" first and foremost , we will focus on urgent matters regarding the businesses and homes of this country . " the coalition of the social democratic alliance and the left-green party said it would stick to the recovery program agreed with the international monetary fund , which came to iceland 's rescue with a $ 10 billion bailout package . government pledges fast action left-green leader steingrimur sigfusson , who will serve as finance minister , will set up a monetary policy commission to make decisions on interest rates , bank reserves and cash requirements , the government said in a statement . it added that it would act quickly to remove central bank bosses , and plan a series of public works projects to boost employment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haarde 's government buckled under the weight of protest over his handling of the financial crisis .
some analysts are already warning that the new government may not be able to make much headway in tackling iceland 's enormous economic problems in the short period until elections in april .
but sigurdardottir 's administration will at least no longer be crippled by the widespread public mistrust which brought down her predecessor . " the major change is maybe that now you have a government that the icelandic people will be inclined to trust , " birgir gudmundsson , professor of media and politics at the university of akureyri told reuters news agency . no word on eu membership the new government has not yet addressed an issue on many people 's minds following iceland 's collapse - namely that of a speedy membership process to join the european union .
that is a question that is expected to be debated in april 's election . the government would only say that both coalition parties agree that membership in the eu could only be decided on the basis of a national referendum . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the world economic forum in davos on friday , she called for an international economic body to be set up , charged with the task of preventing rather than reacting to crises . " this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the -lrb- un -rrb- security council was created after the second world war , " she said . sarkozy 's office denies report of extra meeting at the same time , the french daily le monde reported in its sunday edition that sarkozy is calling for an extraordinary meeting of eurozone countries .
sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .

" a french presidency spokesman has denied the newspaper 's report , telling reuters news agency that an emergency eurozone meeting " is not on the agenda " of the president . the issue is likely to be addressed during a scheduled television appearance by sarkozy on thursday , and discussed in detail when he meets merkel on saturday for an annual security conference in munich . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in bremen a weakened bremen side who were missing star midfielder diego and striker claudio pizarro through suspension , as well as several other injured players , went behind in the 24th minute as thorben marx slipped the ball past goalkeeper tim wiese .
portuguese striker hugo almeida grabbed an equalizer a minute from the break with a well-taken free-kick and bremen fans were hoping for a much better performance in the second half from their side , but they were to be disappointed .
weak bremen hit by loss of confidence , injuries the bremen defence , where coach thomas schaaf had to replace four injured players , looked weak and it was a bremen mistake that gifted bielefeld their second goal four minutes after the restart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings was just one of bremen 's under-performers bremen captain torsten frings unnecessarily lost the ball in his own half to zambian christopher katongo , who passed the ball into the middle where artur wichniarek was on hand to score his 11th of the season .
bremen enjoyed more of the possession throughout the second half - as they did in the first - but failed to create any real opportunities to score a second goal against a team that they had managed to beat 8-1 at home last season .
bielefeld coach michael frontzeck complimented his side after the win .
" we really fought well .
i think at the end of the day we deserved the victory because of our effort .
" the best thing is that hopefully this will put an end to all this discussion about us not having won a game away from home for 63 matches . "
wichniarek said that his side could not be expected to go into a game in bremen playing offensive football .
" bremen is a good side , you have to make your game from the back and we did that .
we stood firm at the back and i think that made the difference . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a company hired by deutsche bahn collected information such as addresses , telephone numbers and banking information and compared it with a list of 80,000 companies that do business with deutsche bahn .
the goal of the surveillance was to uncover any areas where bribes could have been paid in exchange for contracts , according to participants at a closed-door meeting of parliament 's transportation committee last week .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 02.02.2009 german interior minister pledges to improve turkish integration großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's turkish population numbers 2.8 million people german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble is calling for greater efforts in integrating germany 's immigrant communities , in particular those of turkish origin , in a newspaper article to be published on monday . " the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .
schaeuble expressed support for a rigorous discussion about integration .
" that counts for the recognition of the many achievements of immigrants , as well as a serious discussion about the deficits of integration . " dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .
schaeuble expressed support for a rigorous discussion about integration .

" freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .

the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.02.2009 german government considers bank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't want hypo real estate to go bankrupt the german government is considering a controversial plan to nationalize hypo real estate .
it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .

the eu has welcomed the decision but has said its sanctions on harare would remain in place . the decision by zimbabwe 's longtime opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on friday to go into government with president robert mugabe zanu-pf , ending the party 's nearly five-month campaign for a more equitable power-sharing deal , was welcomed by the european union late sunday but the eu warned that it would judged on what actions it takes .
" i welcome the agreement reached by the zimbabwean parties , in particular to establish the government of national unity , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement , adding that " the government of national unity will be judged by its actions . "
" i call on all parties to comply in good faith with the agreement reached .
only in the context of an equitable political solution , the plight of the zimbabwean people can be alleviated , " he said .
the mdc 's national council ratified the move to implement a september power-sharing accord signed by mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai , despite previous misgivings within the party about the skewed nature of the deal .
despite welcoming the deal , the eu refused to comment on calls from the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and continental giant south africa called for the united states and europe to lift sanctions on zimbabwean president robert mugabe 's regime .
eu crackdown on zimbabwean assets set to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana and the eu will wait before making a decision eu foreign ministers last week tightened sanctions on zimbabwe , freezing the assets of companies based in british tax havens for the first time and adding 26 more names of people close to the mugabe regime or their families to a travel-ban list , bringing the number to 203 .
the number of companies whose assets in europe must be frozen was increased sharply from four to 40 and for the first time european-based firms are included .
according to eu sources , all 18 of the european company names added are based on british territory , including tax havens jersey , the isle of man and the british virgin islands .
a spokesman for the eu 's czech presidency said sunday that any lifting of sanctions could only be decided by the ministers and recalled that their next meeting in brussels is set for february 23 .
the au 's executive council adopted a resolution ahead of the three-day african union summit in the ethiopian capital addis ababa sunday , calling for " the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe to help ease the humanitarian situation in the country . "
au calls on action to help zimbabwe recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au calls on international help to aid zimbabwe african union head jean ping , when asked about sanctions levied by the united states and european union , said : " i think that everybody today should help zimbabwe to rebuild its economy , because an agreement has been reached . "
since disputed elections in march 2008 , zimbabwe 's shattered economy has nosedived further .
it has the world 's highest inflation rate - 231 million percent - and is struggling with a cholera epidemic that has claimed some 3,000 lives .
ping said : " imagine that you do n't help zimbabwe , who will be blamed ?
everybody is expecting that today , because tsvangirai is going to lead the economy and everything , that the economy should recover .
so if you do n't do that , who will be blamed by the population ? "
us , uk skeptical of unity agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe have been sparring for months commenting on the deal reached between zanu pf and the mdc , us state department acting spokesman robert wood said : " i 've seen the reports about this agreement , but as you can understand , we are a bit skeptical .
these types of things have been announced before .
the key is always implementation . "
an equally tempered reaction emerged from london , where british foreign secretary david miliband said he looked forward to seeing details of a deal that would hold zimbabwean lawmakers accountable .
" the new government will be judged on its actions , above all by the people of zimbabwe , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 02.02.2009 analysis : german anger at pope 's pardon of bishop continues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's reversal of the excommunication is seen by many germans as a major error the outrage over the decision by pope benedict xvi to readmit to the church a conservative bishop , known for his denial of the holocaust , is showing no signs of abating in the pontiff 's native germany . the pope 's decision to release from excommunication four ultra-conservative bishops who run the society of saint pius x -lrb- sspx -rrb- was intended as an act of reconciliation within the catholic church .
but the timing could hardly have been worse . bishop williamson , one of the four to be reinstated , said two weeks ago on swedish television " historical evidence is hugely against six million jews having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of adolf hitler . " that benedict went ahead and publicized the bishops ' pardon , just three days before holocaust memorial day , is seen as an oversight at best , and at worst a lack of concern for the repercussions . benedict defused some of the anger when he publicly expressed " solidarity " with jewish communities during his general audience last wednesday .
he recalled his pilgrimages to auschwitz and said the former nazi death camp represented a " warning against oblivion , -lrb- holocaust -rrb- denial and reductionism . " mixed feelings over pontiff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charlotte knobloch says the germany-born pope should have known better rome 's chief rabbi , riccardo di segni , said the pontiff 's words were " necessary and welcome and contribute to clear many misunderstandings . " also apparently satisfied was israel 's ambassador to the holy see , mordechai levy .
on friday levy attended the presentation at the vatican of a volume of ancient hebrew manuscripts . however , in the pope 's native germany , where sensitivities about the holocaust are understandably high , the pontiff 's overtures were too little , too late . the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , said in light of the pope 's nationality , she would have " hoped for more sensitivity in dealing with the crimes of the national socialists . " theologians are further asking what kind of catholicism the pope espouses if he is willing to jeopardize relations with liberal church members and other religious faiths in order to court an ultra-traditionalist breakaway group . bishops distance themselves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard williamson has drawn anger from bishops over his comments hamburg 's archbishop werner thissen was reported monday as saying the fact that the pope 's attempt to heal an internal rift within the church coincided with williamson 's unspeakable statements was " dreadful . " german bishop gebhard fuerst of rottenburg-stuttgart publicly distanced himself saturday from the pope 's decision .

she announced her plans in her weekend video address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prevention is better than a cure , says merkel merkel is seeking to improve financial transparency and has called for stricter supervision of the global finance industry .
at the world economic forum in davos on friday , she called for an international economic body to be set up , charged with the task of preventing rather than reacting to crises . " this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the -lrb- un -rrb- security council was created after the second world war , " she said . sarkozy 's office denies report of extra meeting at the same time , the french daily le monde reported in its sunday edition that sarkozy is calling for an extraordinary meeting of eurozone countries .
sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .
31 , 2008 , when the czech republic took over the rotating presidency .
the report in le monde suggests that the french administration finds the czech presidency " too passive , just like the european commission , which could be a little more imaginative . " a french presidency spokesman has denied the newspaper 's report , telling reuters news agency that an emergency eurozone meeting " is not on the agenda " of the president . the issue is likely to be addressed during a scheduled television appearance by sarkozy on thursday , and discussed in detail when he meets merkel on saturday for an annual security conference in munich . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she announced her plans in her weekend video address . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prevention is better than a cure , says merkel merkel is seeking to improve financial transparency and has called for stricter supervision of the global finance industry .
at the world economic forum in davos on friday , she called for an international economic body to be set up , charged with the task of preventing rather than reacting to crises . " this may even lead to a un economic council , just as the -lrb- un -rrb- security council was created after the second world war , " she said . sarkozy 's office denies report of extra meeting at the same time , the french daily le monde reported in its sunday edition that sarkozy is calling for an extraordinary meeting of eurozone countries .
sarkozy chaired the eu until dec .

the report in le monde suggests that the french administration finds the czech presidency " too passive , just like the european commission , which could be a little more imaginative .

she 's promised to rebuild the nation 's economy , which collapsed in the wake of the global financial crisis . sigurdardottir will serve as iceland 's prime minister until the next round of elections , set for april 25 .
she replaces geir haarde , who stepped down last week after protests over his handling of an economic crisis which has left the island nation near bankruptcy . the 66-year-old sigurdardottir , who is also the world 's first openly gay head of government , has her work cut out for her . " this government 's primary objective will be responsible fiscal control , " she said at a news conference .
" first and foremost , we will focus on urgent matters regarding the businesses and homes of this country . " the coalition of the social democratic alliance and the left-green party said it would stick to the recovery program agreed with the international monetary fund , which came to iceland 's rescue with a $ 10 billion bailout package . government pledges fast action left-green leader steingrimur sigfusson , who will serve as finance minister , will set up a monetary policy commission to make decisions on interest rates , bank reserves and cash requirements , the government said in a statement . it added that it would act quickly to remove central bank bosses , and plan a series of public works projects to boost employment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haarde 's government buckled under the weight of protest over his handling of the financial crisis .
some analysts are already warning that the new government may not be able to make much headway in tackling iceland 's enormous economic problems in the short period until elections in april .
but sigurdardottir 's administration will at least no longer be crippled by the widespread public mistrust which brought down her predecessor . " the major change is maybe that now you have a government that the icelandic people will be inclined to trust , " birgir gudmundsson , professor of media and politics at the university of akureyri told reuters news agency . no word on eu membership the new government has not yet addressed an issue on many people 's minds following iceland 's collapse - namely that of a speedy membership process to join the european union .
that is a question that is expected to be debated in april 's election . the government would only say that both coalition parties agree that membership in the eu could only be decided on the basis of a national referendum . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 02.02.2009 eu welcomes zimbabwe unity cabinet but sanctions will remain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe and tsvangirai have agreed to give their unity government deal another try zimbabwe 's rival parties announced at the african union summit on sunday that they would form a new unity government .
the eu has welcomed the decision but has said its sanctions on harare would remain in place . the decision by zimbabwe 's longtime opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- on friday to go into government with president robert mugabe zanu-pf , ending the party 's nearly five-month campaign for a more equitable power-sharing deal , was welcomed by the european union late sunday but the eu warned that it would judged on what actions it takes .
" i welcome the agreement reached by the zimbabwean parties , in particular to establish the government of national unity , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in a statement , adding that " the government of national unity will be judged by its actions . "
" i call on all parties to comply in good faith with the agreement reached .
only in the context of an equitable political solution , the plight of the zimbabwean people can be alleviated , " he said .
the mdc 's national council ratified the move to implement a september power-sharing accord signed by mugabe and mdc leader morgan tsvangirai , despite previous misgivings within the party about the skewed nature of the deal .
despite welcoming the deal , the eu refused to comment on calls from the african union -lrb- au -rrb- and continental giant south africa called for the united states and europe to lift sanctions on zimbabwean president robert mugabe 's regime .
eu crackdown on zimbabwean assets set to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana and the eu will wait before making a decision eu foreign ministers last week tightened sanctions on zimbabwe , freezing the assets of companies based in british tax havens for the first time and adding 26 more names of people close to the mugabe regime or their families to a travel-ban list , bringing the number to 203 .
the number of companies whose assets in europe must be frozen was increased sharply from four to 40 and for the first time european-based firms are included .
according to eu sources , all 18 of the european company names added are based on british territory , including tax havens jersey , the isle of man and the british virgin islands .
a spokesman for the eu 's czech presidency said sunday that any lifting of sanctions could only be decided by the ministers and recalled that their next meeting in brussels is set for february 23 .
the au 's executive council adopted a resolution ahead of the three-day african union summit in the ethiopian capital addis ababa sunday , calling for " the lifting of sanctions against zimbabwe to help ease the humanitarian situation in the country . "
au calls on action to help zimbabwe recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the au calls on international help to aid zimbabwe african union head jean ping , when asked about sanctions levied by the united states and european union , said : " i think that everybody today should help zimbabwe to rebuild its economy , because an agreement has been reached . "
since disputed elections in march 2008 , zimbabwe 's shattered economy has nosedived further .
it has the world 's highest inflation rate - 231 million percent - and is struggling with a cholera epidemic that has claimed some 3,000 lives .
ping said : " imagine that you do n't help zimbabwe , who will be blamed ?
everybody is expecting that today , because tsvangirai is going to lead the economy and everything , that the economy should recover .
so if you do n't do that , who will be blamed by the population ? "
us , uk skeptical of unity agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tsvangirai and mugabe have been sparring for months commenting on the deal reached between zanu pf and the mdc , us state department acting spokesman robert wood said : " i 've seen the reports about this agreement , but as you can understand , we are a bit skeptical .
these types of things have been announced before .
the key is always implementation . "
an equally tempered reaction emerged from london , where british foreign secretary david miliband said he looked forward to seeing details of a deal that would hold zimbabwean lawmakers accountable .
" the new government will be judged on its actions , above all by the people of zimbabwe , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in bremen a weakened bremen side who were missing star midfielder diego and striker claudio pizarro through suspension , as well as several other injured players , went behind in the 24th minute as thorben marx slipped the ball past goalkeeper tim wiese .
portuguese striker hugo almeida grabbed an equalizer a minute from the break with a well-taken free-kick and bremen fans were hoping for a much better performance in the second half from their side , but they were to be disappointed .
weak bremen hit by loss of confidence , injuries the bremen defence , where coach thomas schaaf had to replace four injured players , looked weak and it was a bremen mistake that gifted bielefeld their second goal four minutes after the restart .

bremen enjoyed more of the possession throughout the second half - as they did in the first - but failed to create any real opportunities to score a second goal against a team that they had managed to beat 8-1 at home last season .
bielefeld coach michael frontzeck complimented his side after the win .
" we really fought well .
i think at the end of the day we deserved the victory because of our effort .
" the best thing is that hopefully this will put an end to all this discussion about us not having won a game away from home for 63 matches . "
wichniarek said that his side could not be expected to go into a game in bremen playing offensive football .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .

that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .

abbas is also pushing for a role in rebuilding the war-shattered gaza strip , controlled by hamas . sarkozy also held talks with newly appointed us middle east envoy george mitchell and qatar 's prime minister on monday , seeking to boost prospects for reviving israeli-arab peace talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell , left , seen here with abbas , is testing the waters in the middle east the 75-year-old former us senator said in israel friday that washington was committed to " actively and aggressively " seeking lasting peace in the middle east but warned there would be further setbacks . earlier , qatar 's prime minister sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani too met sarkozy in paris .
after the talks , sheikh hamad bin jassem al-thani said he supported a national unity government for the palestinians and that arab countries should unite to support a palestinian solution . " arab countries can not support one palestinian faction against another , " said the prime minister , who is also foreign minister of the gulf state that brokered a peace accord for lebanon last year . " these disagreements complicate palestinian efforts to succeed in forming a government , " he told reporters . scattered violence strains truce the latest diplomatic drive in paris comes as renewed violence between israelis and palestinians threatens to shatter the shaky ceasefire in gaza . palestinian residents of rafah , a town in the south of the gaza strip , said that israeli f-16 warplanes dropped at least four large bombs sunday night in their efforts to destroy the tunnels , used for smuggling goods and arms into gaza from egypt .
no injuries were reported in the attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an egyptian officer guards the egypt-rafah border suspected to be used by hamas to smuggle weapons into gaza witnesses said earlier that israeli f-16s also conducted missile attacks on an empty hamas police post in central gaza .
no injuries were reported in the strikes , though the compound was said to be completely destroyed . the israeli airstrike came shortly after around eight qassam rockets were launched from gaza on jewish settlements across the border in israel .
the israeli government said one civilian and two soldiers were injured in the attacks , news agency afp reported . israeli prime minister ehud olmert pledged on sunday a " disproportionate " military response to continuing rocket attacks that palestinian militants have described as payback for fresh israeli attacks . livni talks tough but israeli defence minister ehud barak said israel would stop short of all-out war .
" it is not our intention to have an operation cast lead 2 , " he said in an interview with the ynet news web site .
israel 's 22-day offensive in gaza before a ceasefire last month had been known as " operation cast lead " .
" we said there would be a response and there was a response last night , " barak said about sunday 's air strikes .
but on monday , israeli foreign minister tzipi livni struck a tough note , vowing that each rocket attack would be countered .
" we will continue to strike at hamas .
and our strategic goal can not be to accept their existence , " livni said in speech .
" if a deterrence has not been achieved at the end of the campaign , we will continue to do so until they get the message , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is hoping to be israel 's next prime minister " we will respond to every attack , every shooting at israel , every attack on israeli sovereignty and continue to take action if there is a need , " she added .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .

with the economic recession raising fears about ireland 's status in europe , a new opinion poll shows most irish people would vote to back the eu 's lisbon treaty if a second referendum was held this year . in june 2008 , the irish voted " no " to the lisbon treaty aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions .
but that was before the global financial crisis began making its effects felt .
now , support for the treaty has surged , according to the sunday business post / red c poll , which showed 58 percent in favor , 28 percent against , and 14 percent undecided . excluding the undecided votes , pollsters said that if a referendum were held now , 67 percent would back the treaty , and 33 percent would vote against it . " in analyzing the results , it is apparent that 20 to 25 percent of those who voted ' no " last time now suggest that they 've changed their mind and will vote ' yes ' if the referendum is held again , " the newspaper said . irish prime minister brian cowen said he is prepared to hold another vote later this year . " seismic change " in attitudes last week , another polling company , lansdowne market research , said there had been a " seismic change " in attitudes in ireland , which was once dubbed the " celtic tiger " during a period of sustained economic growth .
but the country has suffered a reversal of fortune , with a two-year downturn in housing prices prompting the government to predict a 4 percent decrease in economic output this year . this has been accompanied by an erosion of trust in ireland 's government .

" everyone is talking about protective shields at banks and businesses , " freiberg told the daily ruhr nachrichten on monday , feb .

" we need a functioning protective shield from terrorism . he added that the danger of terrorism in germany exists but remains " absent from people 's minds as long as nothing happens . " since the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks in the united states , germany 's police force has shrunk by some 10,000 people , freiberg said , adding that this meant germany " was not able to monitor the risks - a circle of between 60 and 100 people - around the clock . " freiberg said germany , as the country contributing the third largest number of troops to the war in afghanistan , was a logical target for terrorists . germany currently has 3,600 troops in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force battling the taliban in that country . electoral parallels to spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one man has been convicted over the madrid train bombing the federal criminal police office and the office for the protection of the constitution sought on sunday , feb .

the move comes after several videos were posted on the internet in which masked men vowed in several languages to attack germany for supporting the us-led military campaign in afghanistan . the threat comes in the lead up to elections in the bundestag later this year , with some experts drawing parallels to the march 11 , 2004 , madrid train bombings that occurred three days before spain 's general election . in that incident , 10 bombs detonated on four packed commuter trains , killing 191 people and injuring around 1,800 more .
islamic militants were believed to be behind the attack . jose luis rodriguez zapatero , leader of spain 's socialist party , which won the general election , immediately condemned the war in iraq and said he would pull spanish troops out of the country . exaggerated threat but the head of the essen institute for terrorism and security policy research , rolf tophoven , warned against over-stating the possibility of a terrorist attack on germany based on comparisons with the madrid bombing . " germany in 2009 is not spain in 2004 , " he told cologne daily kölner stadt-anzeiger .
" in spain , 90 percent of the population was against the iraq troop deployment .
and the socialist head of the government , jose luis zapatero , would have withdrawn spanish troops from iraq without these attacks . " in germany , we have a clear parliamentary majority in favor of the armed forces deployment in hindu kush , " tophoven said .
" in addition , a lengthening of germany 's afghanistan mission was only decided on in october -lrb- last year -rrb- , so the issue will not be raised in the bundestag election .

" the linguistic integration , especially of citizens of turkish origin , must be improved " , schaeuble wrote for monday 's edition of the hamburger abendblatt .
" we need more intensive pre-school preparation for children of migrants , so they can use education as an opportunity , " the interior minister wrote .
figures released last week showed that germany 's population of turkish descent is poorly integrated , compared to other immigrant groups .
poor results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble wants to see a better integration record education , considered a key indicator of integration , shows significantly low results for turks or germans of turkish origin .
around 30 percent have no school leaving qualification whatsoever , and just 14 percent have passed university entrance level exams , less then half the average of their german counterparts .
these results , schaeuble said , could n't be ignored .
school leaving certificates and vocational training were preconditions for social participation , and thus for the unity and cohesion of our society , the minister wrote .
guest workers no more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is the key to integration during the economic boom of the 1950s , large numbers of turks were invited to work in germany , on the understanding that these so-called " guest workers " would one day return home .
instead , their families followed .
numbering 2.8 million people , germany 's turkish population is now one of the country 's largest immigrant groups .
the low socioeconomic standing of the turkish laborers , coupled with their large presence in germany , reduced the impetus for turkish families to adapt to germany , learn the language or value their children 's education , according to last week 's report .
schaeuble expressed support for a rigorous discussion about integration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 02.02.2009 german government considers bank takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany does n't want hypo real estate to go bankrupt the german government is considering a controversial plan to nationalize hypo real estate .
it would mark the first government takeover of a private bank since world war ii . the german government has become increasingly concerned about hypo real estate , a german property lender brought low by the financial crisis .
the government , which has already provided more than 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in government loan guarantees , is desperate to keep the munich-based company from going bankrupt .
the government is under increasing pressure to act fast to save the bank .
hypo real estate shares dropped 13 percent at the end of last week after chief executive axel wieandt said that the bank was finding more problematic loans on its books that might require additional state aid .
some high-ranking government officials say they believe the only answer is to nationalize hypo real estate and create a so-called " bad bank " to take over the troubled lender 's toxic assets .
no formal proposal has been made , although a decision could come as soon as this week .
difficult decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrueck has come out in favor of nationalization the proposal to nationalize hypo real estate remains a political hot potato , going against germany 's post -world war ii economic policy .
" i have deep constitutional concerns , " christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- business expert josef schlarmann , told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper in its monday , feb .
2 , edition .
german law prohibits the government from taking a majority share in a private company .
yet social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- finance minister peer steinbrueck has recently been discussing a change to the law which would allow nationalizations when financial market stability is threatened .
spd head franz muenterfering said that the government wanted to avoid nationalizing banks , but that it had to be considered when the bank 's future was at risk .
" you have to consider whether the state , in order to fend off a fatal disaster , must take over such responsibilities for a time , " muenterfering said .
political posturing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is worried about its banking sector further complicating the debate is that the cdu and spd currently form a left-right coalition in the government .
but the two political parties , germany 's largest , are also gearing up for a fall election showdown .
germany 's conservative chancellor angela merkel , has said only that hypo real estate must be brought " to a recovery position . "
cdu leader volker kauder has said that it would be a mistake to let hypo real estate go under .
" we should not let even one systemic bank in germany go bankrupt , " he told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday , citing the problems that followed when lehman brothers in the us went bankrupt .
creating a " bad bank " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german banks have been hard hit by the crisis on wall street if the hypo real estate plan goes forward , germany could become the first euro zone country to set up a state-backed bank to house toxic assets .
while opposition remains to setting up a national " bad bank , " german politicians have warmed to the idea of setting up individual banks to house toxic assets .
" what i can imagine to be the right way is that each bank takes responsibility for its less valuable assets , " the cdu 's kauder told the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , last week .
yet a national " bad bank " might happen anyway .
there are signs that germany 's commercial lenders are drawing up a plan to create a joint bad bank which would be guaranteed by the state , according to reuters news agency .
britain , us also discussion options germany is not alone in struggling to deal with toxic assets .
the international monetary fund estimates that the losses from toxic assets will cost us and european banks $ 500 billion .
governments in the united states and britain are also debating how to best clean up the banks .
us president barack obama is expected to roll out plans this week for cleaning up debt and recapitalizing banks and has also discussed the possibility of setting up a " bad bank .

chancellor angela merkel has promised a tax cut if re-elected this fall .
yet some conservatives in her party are not sold on the idea . merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had positioned itself as the party of fiscal responsibility and thrown its support behind an effort to balance the government 's budget by 2011 .
that was before the global financial crisis put the breaks on germany 's export-driven economy .
now , merkel has said she will push for further changes to the country 's tax laws , even if it means larger federal deficits .
" a tax reform with tax cuts is part of our offer in the election program , " the chancellor said at a gathering of cdu members in berlin on saturday , jan .

to tax or not to tax ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu hopes to win elections in the fall yet the tax issue remains a bone of contention among conservatives , who are preparing for a federal election in september .
opinion polls show merkel 's conservatives well ahead of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- .
some cdu members have expressed worry about deficits which will be caused by the government 's 50 billion euro -lrb- $ 64.24 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
the stimulus package includes a modest 2.9 billion euros for tax relief measures for 2009 and 6.05 billion euros in 2010 .
it also includes infrastructure investment in roads , railways and schools .
merkel had originally fought keep tax cuts out of the economic stimulus package , saying that it would hurt the government 's budget .
but she eventually bowed to pressure from bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , which partners with the cdu in parliament , to go along with the cuts .
but merkel promised that " the discussion is not yet over " when it comes to tax reform .
critics remain unconvinced bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she 's willing to discuss additional tax cuts yet there are still plenty of critics within the party .
peter mueller , cdu premier of the western state of saarland , spoke out in an interview published sunday against tax cuts , saying the recent stimulus packages made them unaffordable .
other senior cdu members , including interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , have also publicly voiced concern about going ahead with cuts .
the ongoing disagreement led the cdu 's volker kauder to call for better party unity in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung on sunday .
the party is planning to develop a new tax plan by easter .
until then , " we have agreed to not publicly debate the issue , " he told the newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it calls for a sea-change in social attitudes and policies to counter the damage done to children by society .
family break-up , unprincipled advertising , too much competition in education and income inequality are mentioned as big contributing factors .
a panel of independent experts carried out the study over three years .
the report , called the good childhood inquiry and commissioned by the children 's society , concludes that children 's lives in britain have become " more difficult than in the past " , adding that " more young people are anxious and troubled " .
according to the panel , " excessive individualism " is to blame for many of the problems children face and needs to be replaced by a value system where people seek satisfaction more from helping others rather than pursuing private advantage .
what makes a good childhood ?
a spokesman for the department for children schools and families said : " we know there are still risks and challenges ahead for children and parents and that there is more for us all to do " .
' tone deaf ' the inquiry has a long list of recommendations including : • abolishing sats tests and league tables in english schools • a ban on all advertising aimed at the under 12s and no tv commercials for alcohol or unhealthy food before the 9pm watershed • stopping building on any open space where children play • a high-quality youth centre for every 5,000 young people " individual freedom and self-determination bring many blessings , " writes the report 's principal author , labour peer lord richard layard .
" but in britain ... the balance has tilted too far , " he says .
this is a starting point for a debate as to why a million and a half british children are unhappy and why young people 's emotional health appears to be worsening .
mark easton 's blog another contributor , the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams , suggests society has become " tone-deaf to the real requirements of children … in a climate where the mixture of sentimentalism and panic makes discussion of children 's issues so difficult " .
the panel , made up of 11 experts including eight university professors , says its conclusions are evidence based .
but some of its findings on family life in britain are bound to be controversial .
working mothers it cites research suggesting that three times as many three year olds living with lone parents or a step-parent have behavioural problems compared with those living with married parents .

" child-rearing is one of the most challenging tasks in life and ideally it requires two people , " the report concludes .
it also suggests that having many more working mothers has contributed to the damage done to children .
" most women now work and their new economic independence contributes to levels of family break-up which are higher in the uk than in any other western european country . "
the panel has a series of recommendations aimed at improving the quality of family life experienced by children : • a civil birth ceremony conducted by a registrar in which parents publicly accept the responsibilities of parenthood • free parenting classes available around the time of birth • free psychological and family support if relationships struggle • rules making it easier for parents to stay at home to rear their children chief executive of the children 's society , bob reitemeyer , commissioned the research which included more than 30,000 submissions from organisations and children .
" essentially the report brings a taboo into the open which is that we have to confront our selfish and individualistic culture , " he said .
" we need to realise that we are collectively responsible for the welfare of all children and that together we can make childhood better . "
the secretary of state for children , schools and families , ed balls , is studying the report .
the report says parents should have free parenting classes although government may be sympathetic to some of the inquiry 's conclusions , it is unlikely it will implement its radical proposals in the near future .
the government statement said : " the report mirrors the ambitious plan for improving children 's lives and outcomes we set out in our children 's plan , which aims to give every child the best chance in life , and we are pleased that the review acknowledges the positive impact that the children 's plan is already having on children 's lives .
" we know there are still risks and challenges ahead for children and parents and that there is more for us all to do .
" but as the report points out , in many ways our children have never lived so well - children are more educated , less sick , and more tolerant , and the government is working hard to invest , help and support children and their families to make britain the best place in the world to grow up . "
