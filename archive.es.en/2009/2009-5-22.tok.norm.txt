" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .

"
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .

from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "

a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim conducted a legendary beethoven concert in berlin just days after the fall of the wall on november 12 , 1989 , just three days after the fall of the berlin wall , barenboim once again traveled to the freshly reunited german capital - this time to conduct what is now considered an iconic beethoven concert with the berlin philharmonic for the city 's new residents who had grown up in the communist eastern sector .
" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .

the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .

the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

the social democrat wants all germans to have the same voting rights , a measure she says will lead to an increase in legal clarity and will stand as a symbol for integration .
sexual can of worms in a further initiative , which is bound to cause hefty debate not only with the church but also with her party 's conservative coalition partners , the cdu and csu , zypries is calling for equality for homosexual and heterosexual partnerships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister zypries is striving for equality “ the constitution should be changed because life partners should be given the same respect and recognition as married partners … homosexual and heterosexual couples should be equal , ” she said in the faz .

the classic freedoms embodied in the basic law are that of religion , speech and press as well as the right to conscientious objection .
equality is also guaranteed .

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .

they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.05.2009 berlin 's kadewe goes up for sale as german retailers fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadewe is a berlin landmark for years , mid-level department stores have been losing business to the discount and luxury sectors .
even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .
" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .
today , however , it 's pulsating with life .
tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .
so the store has , at any rate , had a positive effect on the whole street . " while karstadt may have attracted both visitors and investors to potsdam , that does n't mean the company itself is doing well .
it declined to comment on the matter . sales figures indicate that another department store chain , kaufhof , which is owned by the wholesale group metro , is doing somewhat better - and has even expressed an interest in buying up karstadt 's 121 failing stores .
however , earlier this week , arcandor chief eick rejected rumors of a possible merger . future may be in discount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters have wooed customers away from traditional department stores at the kaufhof department store on berlin 's alexanderplatz , visitors are ushered in by a doorman . " a few years ago , -lsb- customers -rsb- would have found tables piled high with bed linen or one-deutschmark items at the entrance , " said store manager detlef steffens , who had the location completely renovated .
" you wo n't see anything like that here .
the customers do n't want those things at a downtown department store . " steffens completely revamped his store 's product line a few years ago .
it no longer sells furniture , rugs or lamps , which are generally not the sort of things city center shoppers are after , he said .
instead , there are more clothes , displayed according to brand . kadewe , kaufhof 's big competitor , has gone one step further .
there , some manufacturers offer their products at their own expense .
the idea may have helped sustain kadewe , but it is n't necessarily a panacea , said consumer researcher balderjahn . " i think only a very , very small number of these well-known department stores will be able to continue to assert themselves in the same way as kadewe , " he added .
" the vast majority of stores will have to operate at a lower discount level in order to survive . " author : karsten zummack -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.05.2009 berlin 's kadewe goes up for sale as german retailers fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadewe is a berlin landmark for years , mid-level department stores have been losing business to the discount and luxury sectors .
even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .
" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .
today , however , it 's pulsating with life .
tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .
so the store has , at any rate , had a positive effect on the whole street . " while karstadt may have attracted both visitors and investors to potsdam , that does n't mean the company itself is doing well .
it declined to comment on the matter . sales figures indicate that another department store chain , kaufhof , which is owned by the wholesale group metro , is doing somewhat better - and has even expressed an interest in buying up karstadt 's 121 failing stores .
however , earlier this week , arcandor chief eick rejected rumors of a possible merger . future may be in discount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters have wooed customers away from traditional department stores at the kaufhof department store on berlin 's alexanderplatz , visitors are ushered in by a doorman . " a few years ago , -lsb- customers -rsb- would have found tables piled high with bed linen or one-deutschmark items at the entrance , " said store manager detlef steffens , who had the location completely renovated .
" you wo n't see anything like that here .
the customers do n't want those things at a downtown department store . " steffens completely revamped his store 's product line a few years ago .
it no longer sells furniture , rugs or lamps , which are generally not the sort of things city center shoppers are after , he said .
instead , there are more clothes , displayed according to brand . kadewe , kaufhof 's big competitor , has gone one step further .
there , some manufacturers offer their products at their own expense .
the idea may have helped sustain kadewe , but it is n't necessarily a panacea , said consumer researcher balderjahn . " i think only a very , very small number of these well-known department stores will be able to continue to assert themselves in the same way as kadewe , " he added .
" the vast majority of stores will have to operate at a lower discount level in order to survive . " author : karsten zummack -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .
" we do n't like the spot much , but the law says that we must not reject it and have to broadcast it , " czech television spokesman ladislav sticha said to czech media .
the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .
" we do n't like the spot much , but the law says that we must not reject it and have to broadcast it , " czech television spokesman ladislav sticha said to czech media .
the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .
" we do n't like the spot much , but the law says that we must not reject it and have to broadcast it , " czech television spokesman ladislav sticha said to czech media .
the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "
both fischer and human rights minister michael kocab said they considered the video illegal .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .

"
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.05.2009 eu-russia summit reveals differences rather than agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , medvedev and barroso agreed on agreeing but little else eu and russian leaders failed to mend the rifts at their summit in the siberian town of khabarovsk .
moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .

" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .

from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .

he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.05.2009 eu-russia summit reveals differences rather than agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , medvedev and barroso agreed on agreeing but little else eu and russian leaders failed to mend the rifts at their summit in the siberian town of khabarovsk .
moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.05.2009 obama 's guantanamo policy reignites us national security debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's plans to close the guantanamo prison camp have run into difficulties at home the us president says he will not release guantanamo detainees who still pose a threat to national security .
but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .

political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .

they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "

cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .

according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .

cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.05.2009 majority of teams still need to win as bundesliga season draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg are gunning for their first bundesliga championship never before in league history has so much been up for grabs on the final day of play .
seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .

the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 22.05.2009 germany in top-model fever as the " yes-she-can " girl wins hit tv show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sara nuru -lrb- r . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief as she won heidi klum 's casting show in what seemed like an evening of never-ending commercials occasionally broken by bits of a tv program , 19-year-old sara nuru , the daughter of ethiopian immigrants , won the coveted title of " germany 's next top model . " over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .

bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .

the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .

"
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.05.2009 eu-russia summit reveals differences rather than agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , medvedev and barroso agreed on agreeing but little else eu and russian leaders failed to mend the rifts at their summit in the siberian town of khabarovsk .
moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .

the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .

few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .

already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.05.2009 sacked bayern coach plays blame game ahead of bundesliga finale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann wishes he had had more time at bayern former bayern munich coach juergen klinsmann says the club 's management and his former players are partly responsible for his failed 10-month stint with the german champions . " i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .

the social democrat wants all germans to have the same voting rights , a measure she says will lead to an increase in legal clarity and will stand as a symbol for integration .
sexual can of worms in a further initiative , which is bound to cause hefty debate not only with the church but also with her party 's conservative coalition partners , the cdu and csu , zypries is calling for equality for homosexual and heterosexual partnerships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister zypries is striving for equality “ the constitution should be changed because life partners should be given the same respect and recognition as married partners … homosexual and heterosexual couples should be equal , ” she said in the faz .
zypries has also received support from the green party in her backing of same-sex couples .
the cdu and csu , however , insist that a clear difference between heterosexual and homosexual partnerships should remain . this gibes with the german constitution , which states in article six : " marriage and family stand under the special protection of the state system . "

in 1990 , following reunification , the basic law became valid for the whole nation .
the classic freedoms embodied in the basic law are that of religion , speech and press as well as the right to conscientious objection .
equality is also guaranteed .

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .

they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "

cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .

the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .

" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .

" the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.05.2009 berlin 's kadewe goes up for sale as german retailers fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadewe is a berlin landmark for years , mid-level department stores have been losing business to the discount and luxury sectors .
even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .
" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .
today , however , it 's pulsating with life .
tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .
so the store has , at any rate , had a positive effect on the whole street . " while karstadt may have attracted both visitors and investors to potsdam , that does n't mean the company itself is doing well .
it declined to comment on the matter . sales figures indicate that another department store chain , kaufhof , which is owned by the wholesale group metro , is doing somewhat better - and has even expressed an interest in buying up karstadt 's 121 failing stores .
however , earlier this week , arcandor chief eick rejected rumors of a possible merger . future may be in discount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters have wooed customers away from traditional department stores at the kaufhof department store on berlin 's alexanderplatz , visitors are ushered in by a doorman . " a few years ago , -lsb- customers -rsb- would have found tables piled high with bed linen or one-deutschmark items at the entrance , " said store manager detlef steffens , who had the location completely renovated .
" you wo n't see anything like that here .
the customers do n't want those things at a downtown department store . " steffens completely revamped his store 's product line a few years ago .
it no longer sells furniture , rugs or lamps , which are generally not the sort of things city center shoppers are after , he said .
instead , there are more clothes , displayed according to brand . kadewe , kaufhof 's big competitor , has gone one step further .
there , some manufacturers offer their products at their own expense .
the idea may have helped sustain kadewe , but it is n't necessarily a panacea , said consumer researcher balderjahn . " i think only a very , very small number of these well-known department stores will be able to continue to assert themselves in the same way as kadewe , " he added .
" the vast majority of stores will have to operate at a lower discount level in order to survive . " author : karsten zummack -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .

he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .

" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .
" we do n't like the spot much , but the law says that we must not reject it and have to broadcast it , " czech television spokesman ladislav sticha said to czech media .
the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "
both fischer and human rights minister michael kocab said they considered the video illegal .

" the european convention on human rights guarantees the right to the freedom of expression , but the convention also sets limits .

in seeking to ban the national party , prime minister fischer has asked interior minister martin pecna to act immediately .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .

the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .

a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .

he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim conducted a legendary beethoven concert in berlin just days after the fall of the wall on november 12 , 1989 , just three days after the fall of the berlin wall , barenboim once again traveled to the freshly reunited german capital - this time to conduct what is now considered an iconic beethoven concert with the berlin philharmonic for the city 's new residents who had grown up in the communist eastern sector .
" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "
barenboim is also well known for founding the west-east divan orchestra in 1999 , together with late palestinian intellectual edward said .
it brings together young arab and israeli musicians and aims to promote dialogue and understanding between them . sp / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?

they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "

cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "

" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim conducted a legendary beethoven concert in berlin just days after the fall of the wall on november 12 , 1989 , just three days after the fall of the berlin wall , barenboim once again traveled to the freshly reunited german capital - this time to conduct what is now considered an iconic beethoven concert with the berlin philharmonic for the city 's new residents who had grown up in the communist eastern sector .
" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "
barenboim is also well known for founding the west-east divan orchestra in 1999 , together with late palestinian intellectual edward said .
it brings together young arab and israeli musicians and aims to promote dialogue and understanding between them . sp / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .

but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.05.2009 opel tender decision still hangs in the balance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel remains " for sale " - but for how much longer ?
a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim conducted a legendary beethoven concert in berlin just days after the fall of the wall on november 12 , 1989 , just three days after the fall of the berlin wall , barenboim once again traveled to the freshly reunited german capital - this time to conduct what is now considered an iconic beethoven concert with the berlin philharmonic for the city 's new residents who had grown up in the communist eastern sector .
" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "
barenboim is also well known for founding the west-east divan orchestra in 1999 , together with late palestinian intellectual edward said .
it brings together young arab and israeli musicians and aims to promote dialogue and understanding between them . sp / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .

the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .

"
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

the social democrat wants all germans to have the same voting rights , a measure she says will lead to an increase in legal clarity and will stand as a symbol for integration .
sexual can of worms in a further initiative , which is bound to cause hefty debate not only with the church but also with her party 's conservative coalition partners , the cdu and csu , zypries is calling for equality for homosexual and heterosexual partnerships .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister zypries is striving for equality “ the constitution should be changed because life partners should be given the same respect and recognition as married partners … homosexual and heterosexual couples should be equal , ” she said in the faz .
zypries has also received support from the green party in her backing of same-sex couples .
the cdu and csu , however , insist that a clear difference between heterosexual and homosexual partnerships should remain . this gibes with the german constitution , which states in article six : " marriage and family stand under the special protection of the state system . "
" temporary " constitution the constitution , or basic law , was formally adopted by a parliamentary council , chaired by konrad adenauer , on may 23 , 1949 .
adenauer later became west germany 's first chancellor .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adenauer signed the basic law on may 23 , 1949 it was intended as a " temporary " framework for a new democratic system , but , as time passed , it proved to be a working foundation for the federal republic of germany .
in 1990 , following reunification , the basic law became valid for the whole nation .
the classic freedoms embodied in the basic law are that of religion , speech and press as well as the right to conscientious objection .
equality is also guaranteed .
democratic prototype the president of the german constitutional court , hans-juergen papier , in an interview with the daily bild praised the basic law as “ the best constitution that germany has ever had , " adding that its importance lies in its “ clarity , concision and engagement , " qualities which has made it an archetype for many other countries .

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.05.2009 eu-russia summit reveals differences rather than agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana , medvedev and barroso agreed on agreeing but little else eu and russian leaders failed to mend the rifts at their summit in the siberian town of khabarovsk .
moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .

he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 22.05.2009 berlin 's kadewe goes up for sale as german retailers fight to survive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadewe is a berlin landmark for years , mid-level department stores have been losing business to the discount and luxury sectors .
even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .
" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .
today , however , it 's pulsating with life .
tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .
so the store has , at any rate , had a positive effect on the whole street . " while karstadt may have attracted both visitors and investors to potsdam , that does n't mean the company itself is doing well .
it declined to comment on the matter . sales figures indicate that another department store chain , kaufhof , which is owned by the wholesale group metro , is doing somewhat better - and has even expressed an interest in buying up karstadt 's 121 failing stores .
however , earlier this week , arcandor chief eick rejected rumors of a possible merger . future may be in discount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters have wooed customers away from traditional department stores at the kaufhof department store on berlin 's alexanderplatz , visitors are ushered in by a doorman . " a few years ago , -lsb- customers -rsb- would have found tables piled high with bed linen or one-deutschmark items at the entrance , " said store manager detlef steffens , who had the location completely renovated .
" you wo n't see anything like that here .
the customers do n't want those things at a downtown department store . " steffens completely revamped his store 's product line a few years ago .
it no longer sells furniture , rugs or lamps , which are generally not the sort of things city center shoppers are after , he said .
instead , there are more clothes , displayed according to brand . kadewe , kaufhof 's big competitor , has gone one step further .
there , some manufacturers offer their products at their own expense .
the idea may have helped sustain kadewe , but it is n't necessarily a panacea , said consumer researcher balderjahn . " i think only a very , very small number of these well-known department stores will be able to continue to assert themselves in the same way as kadewe , " he added .
" the vast majority of stores will have to operate at a lower discount level in order to survive . " author : karsten zummack -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "

in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .

" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

the national party -lrb- ns -rrb- , which is vying for a seat in elections to the european parliament on june 5 and 6 , used the phrase " a final solution to the gypsy problem " in a campaign ad that ran on czech television on wednesday .
" we do n't like the spot much , but the law says that we must not reject it and have to broadcast it , " czech television spokesman ladislav sticha said to czech media .
the head of czech television jiri janacek said the ad would not be aired again .
prime minister jan fischer has called for banning the national party , saying the ad evoked , " the -lsb- nazis -rsb- ' final solution ' of the jewish question during world war ii . "

tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .

" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .

" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .

" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .

when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "

even so , arcandor plans to drop berlin 's iconic high-end kadewe department store to focus on the mid-priced sector . kadewe , berlin 's premier department store , appears in every travel guide to the german capital . some 40,000 visitors turn up there every day and in the pre-christmas season , up to 180,000 people go there to shop . at the entrance , small exclusive shops - gucci , louis vuitton and cartier - vie for big-spending customers with 4,000-euro -lrb- $ 5,500 -rrb- watches and 2,000-euro handbags .
up on the sixth floor , shoppers get together over champagne and lobster cocktails in the store 's gourmet food section . kadewe - short for " kaufhaus des westens , " or " department store of the west " - is a real " pearl , " said karl-gerhard eick , the new head of arcandor , the group that owns the berlin shopping landmark . although exact numbers have n't been made public , word is that kadewe is still turning a profit , even as arcandor itself faces imminent insolvency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seen here in 1928 , kadewe first opened in 1907 nevertheless , arcandor is looking to get rid of not just kadewe , but also its other premium department stores , oberpollinger in munich and alsterhaus in hamburg .
it aims to focus more on the mid-level market segment .
straying from the trend industry analysts , however , doubt this strategy will bear fruit . " it 's pretty surprising to me that classic department stores like karstadt and hertie seem to have missed the trend in this area , " said consumer researcher ingo balderjahn from the university of potsdam .
" they were still using relatively old-fashioned concepts , while the market has long since developed in another direction : either discount or luxury . " for years , german food discounters like aldi and lidl have also been selling clothes , electronics and household appliances at bulk-rate prices , luring customers away from the major department stores .
in addition , low-priced apparel chains such as kik , takko and ernstings family have expanded their business in germany . until the 1970s , department stores accounted for 14 percent of total retail sales in germany , whereas today their share amounts to only about 3.3 percent . still , most german cities have pedestrian zones in their downtown areas , where department stores continue to draw vast numbers of shoppers . bildunterschrift : arcandor wants to give up kadewe to focus on karstadt , which has been criticized for its old-fashioned strategy good for everyone else 's business in potsdam , just outside of berlin , the pedestrian zone presented a dismal picture in the 1990s : grey facades , and empty or boarded up shop windows .
today , however , it 's pulsating with life .
tourists stroll through the area , linger in the cafes and spend their money in the boutiques that line the streets . according to one study , the number of passersby has more than doubled in the past 10 years , and one reason for that was the opening of a karstadt department store there in march 2005 . " the department store is a big crowd-puller in town , " said eva gerber , who runs a jewelry business in the area .
" and i always say that those who endured the sluggish business before karstadt came should get a medal for perseverance .
so the store has , at any rate , had a positive effect on the whole street . " while karstadt may have attracted both visitors and investors to potsdam , that does n't mean the company itself is doing well .
it declined to comment on the matter . sales figures indicate that another department store chain , kaufhof , which is owned by the wholesale group metro , is doing somewhat better - and has even expressed an interest in buying up karstadt 's 121 failing stores .
however , earlier this week , arcandor chief eick rejected rumors of a possible merger . future may be in discount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounters have wooed customers away from traditional department stores at the kaufhof department store on berlin 's alexanderplatz , visitors are ushered in by a doorman . " a few years ago , -lsb- customers -rsb- would have found tables piled high with bed linen or one-deutschmark items at the entrance , " said store manager detlef steffens , who had the location completely renovated .
" you wo n't see anything like that here .
the customers do n't want those things at a downtown department store . " steffens completely revamped his store 's product line a few years ago .
it no longer sells furniture , rugs or lamps , which are generally not the sort of things city center shoppers are after , he said .
instead , there are more clothes , displayed according to brand . kadewe , kaufhof 's big competitor , has gone one step further .
there , some manufacturers offer their products at their own expense .
the idea may have helped sustain kadewe , but it is n't necessarily a panacea , said consumer researcher balderjahn . " i think only a very , very small number of these well-known department stores will be able to continue to assert themselves in the same way as kadewe , " he added .
" the vast majority of stores will have to operate at a lower discount level in order to survive . " author : karsten zummack -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .
renewing commitments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sun shone on koehler -lrb- 2nd from left -rrb- and merkel as the party began koehler argued against complacency , saying that in view of the new challenges arising today , the commitments enshrined in the german constitution should be renewed .
" we should promise to ourselves that this country will never look away when people need us or are threatening to fall behind .
let 's vow to pursue long-term policies that give future generations a chance to enjoy freedom as well . "
the commemorative event marked the beginning of three days of celebrations .
berlin 's central festival mile is set to be reopened on saturday – a reminder of the 2006 soccer world cup , when hundreds of thousands of fans partook of beer and bratwurst while watching the football matches on giant video screens .
this time around they 'll have the opportunity to see a new german president elected in parliament on saturday .
german pop bands and theater groups will also be performing .
from the rubble on may 23 , 1949 , political leaders in the western part of occupied germany proclaimed the country 's " basic law " - germany 's postwar constitution - which laid the foundation for west germany to emerge from the rubble of world war ii .
about four months later , on october 7 , 1949 , communist leaders in the soviet-occupied zone of eastern germany proclaimed their own state .
the division of germany continued until 1990 , when the country was reunited in the wake of a peaceful popular uprising that brought an end to the communist regime .

"
president horst koehler lauded the post-world war ii constitution for ensuring freedom and prosperity in a democratic system . in an official state act at berlin 's gendarmenmarkt concert hall on friday , president horst koehler lauded 60 years of the german postwar constitution , saying it had turned germany into a " mature democracy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler demanded a renewal of constitutional commitments he said the founding fathers of the federal republic of germany " had drawn lessons from the collapse of the weimar republic .
they also learned from the nazi dictatorship by creating a constitution that laid solid foundations for a free and just society , " he added .
the weimar republic -lrb- 1919-1933 -rrb- was germany 's first attempt at creating a democratic system .
kohler said the postwar transformation of western germany into a country based on democracy and a free-market economy had made the federal republic a prosperous and peace-loving nation .
germany had regained " the status of a respected nation , " koehler said in his speech before political leaders .
" today we have friends all over the world .
we are admired for our economic achievements and political reliability – for always being prepared to help others and fostering peace in the world . "
koehler also described the then west german state as a country deeply rooted in freedom and respect for human dignity .
these commitments helped eastern germans overcome four decades of communism in 1990 , he said .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 22.05.2009 majority of teams still need to win as bundesliga season draws to a close großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg are gunning for their first bundesliga championship never before in league history has so much been up for grabs on the final day of play .
seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .
fiat chief executive sergio marchionne is looking to create the world 's second biggest carmaker , after japan 's toyota , by adding the assets of opel and vauxhall to fiat 's own brands and those of us carmaker chrysler .
german media reports , however , said the fiat plan would involve total job cuts of about 18,000 , compared to about 10,000 each for magna and rhj .
fiat is also seeking some 7 billion euros -lrb- $ 9.7 billion -rrb- in government support , about 2 billion more than magna and rhj require. tw / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a meeting between the german chancellor and top officials , including the heads of the four key opel states is expected to bring the government a step closer to announcing which of the three main bidders it will support . pressure for a decision was mounting after the premier of opel 's home state of hesse , roland koch , said on friday that canadian-austrian group magna 's offer for the carmaker was the most attractive for germany and that fiat 's rival bid was disappointing .
" i think there is a ranking in which the offer from magna is closest to the hopes and wishes of many in the german political arena but also the workers , " koch said in an interview with german radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hessen 's premier says magna presents the best option for german interests " there is a very interesting bid from a financial investor with the group from ripplewood , and surely some are disappointed that the fiat bid is very far from what some had hoped , " he added .
magna , fiat and industrial holding company rhj international , the brussels-based subsidiary of us financial investor ripplewood , submitted offers for opel by a may 20 deadline .
addressing growing media speculation , government spokesman thomas steg called for calm , saying that any premature speculation on a political comment on opel could affect a government negotiating position .
he said the government would be looking at three key factors : a deal for carmaker opel that secures the most jobs and sites in germany and does not burden taxpayers .
steg went on to say that until the government had met with industry experts and the federal state representatives no preference could be drawn .
steg also reiterated that the primary decision lay with the us , which still has to announce whether it is selling gm europe , thus offering up opel for tender .
the us government has given gm until june 1 to restructure its operations and prove it can be viable without state aid , or face probable bankruptcy .
according to koch , none of the three offers would save all the jobs at opel , which has four german plants employing over 20,000 people .
but he said that magna had new ideas , new markets and new clients that were particularly suitable to german considerations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magna is offering to keep all four german opel plants and to keep germany as the company 's european headquarters magna co-chief siegfried wolf said that his company would maintain all opel 's german bases as well as the company 's german headquarters .
" not every job can be secured by a new european opel company but there are perspectives that are particularly interesting to germany as opel 's base .
and in this respect magna 's suggestions are the most interesting , " koch said .
there have been media reports that russia 's largest lender sberbank is discussing the possibility of providing a financial guarantee as part of austro-canadian auto parts maker magna 's bid in the form of guarantees .
though the decision on who gets opel will be taken by gm , the german government will also play a big role because it would likely have to supply billions of euros in financing guarantees to the eventual winner .
this has made the opel tender a political hot potato as the chancellor is just four months away from a general election and must decide how to save jobs and tax-payers money without losing votes .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .

" they are all personalities you have to work with . "

a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .

he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moscow criticised the eu 's new eastern partnership while brussels urged for a more reliable energy supply . at the press conference on the last day of talks , both sides were eager to stress the good relations and the positive atmosphere of the summit .
after tension between brussels and moscow seemed to constantly be on the rise over energy , the caucasus and the influence in eastern europe , both sides saw fit to stress that after all , there 's mutual interest in good ties and successful cooperation .
the talks helped to bridge gaps , czech president vaclav klaus said on friday .
" this meeting has strengthened mutual trust , which is important , " he said .
the czech republic currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
along with klaus , the summit saw eu commission president jose manuel barroso and the bloc 's foreign policy chief javier solana sit down with russian president dmitry medvedev and several cabinet ministers .
" there are no doubts today about the strategic character of the ties between russia and the european union , " the russian president said .
but those mutual reassurances between the eu and the kremlin were hardly backed up by the results on the ground .
already the choice of location was seen by many as a friendly warning to the eu .
the leaders met in the far eastern city of khabarovsk , some 8,000 kilometres from brussels and just off the border with china suggesting that russia has plenty of options with whom to do business and trade energy , other than europe .
conflicting visions of europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's war between russia and georgia over south ossetia remains highly controversial the general mistrust between the two sides remains .
the eu is as strongly opposed as ever to moscow flexing its muscles in the caucasus whereas russia in turn has condemned the eu 's so called " eastern partnership " launched only a few weeks ago in prague .
while brussels wants to strengthen its ties with its eastern neighbours , russia sees the move as an intrusion into its traditional sphere of influence .
" we do not want the eastern partnership to turn into a partnership against russia , " medvedev warned .
" i 'll put it succinctly .
we tried to convince ourselves but in the end we could n't . "
the eu in turn is suspiciously eying russia 's suggestion of a new european security architecture which some critics say is an attempt to push back nato and us influence in europe .
a new energy framework ?
the negotiations on energy policy rendered equally few results .
russia has made much of its recent proposal for a new global energy charter to replace the existing energy charter treaty which was adopted in 1991 to integrate the energy sectors of the former east bloc .
medvedev reaffirmed his objections to the existing charter and warned russia would not take part in it .
the eu in turn suggested to look at moscow 's proposal but commission president jose manuel barroso ruled out a replacement of the existing pact .
" we should not throw away agreements that have already existed for years , " he said .
" we are open to discussing the proposals but without putting under pressure the system that already exists . "
at the heart of the differences over energy supplies is russia 's objective to control as large a share as possible from the gas fields to the final european consumer .
brussels in turn is concerned about its energy dependence on moscow and is seeking ways to ensure access to alternative sources in central asia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is nervous about the annual gas rift between kyiv and moscow another issue on the energy agenda of the talks was ukraine .
the eu urged both moscow and kyiv to avoid a recurrence of this january 's gas stand off .
when russia closed the tap on ukraine , the rest of europe was briefly on the brink of a serious energy crisis in the middle of a cold winter .
" disruption in the export and transport of gas must not be allowed to occur again , " jose manuel barroso said .
" we ask russia and ukraine to do everything in their power to prevent another crisis next year .
european consumers that are not responsible for these problems are suffering the negative consequences . "
but russia expressed its doubt about ukraine 's ability to pay and suggested a syndicated loan agreement with european and russian participation to help out kyiv . " we are ready to help the ukrainian state but would like the european union , those countries that are interested in reliable security of energy cooperation , to take upon themselves the bulk of this work . "
few had expected that the summit in khabarovsk would bring about any major progress , but at least there was hope that the two sides could use the opportunity to move closer and rebuild trust after the disruptions last year .
yet in the end , the smiles and reassurances failed to conceal the significant rifts that remain .
and most of the issues that were left unresolved are likely to persist if not even grow as a stumbling block between moscow and brussels. ai / dpa / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 22.05.2009 obama 's guantanamo policy reignites us national security debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's plans to close the guantanamo prison camp have run into difficulties at home the us president says he will not release guantanamo detainees who still pose a threat to national security .
but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "

cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .

" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "

seven of saturday ’ s nine games feature at least one team battling for glory – or survival .
here ’ s a comprehensive guide . the league title wolfsburg are in the driver 's seat , thanks to a two-point advantage over bayern and stuttgart and a superior goal difference .
indeed , coach felix magath is so confident he gave an interview on the balcony of the munich rathaus – the spot bayern traditionally celebrates titles .
the wolves can clinch the title with a win or – barring a freakishly lopsided result between their two competitors – a draw against werder bremen .
they 're playing at home , where their record is 15 wins and one draw , and their opponents are coming off a midweek dogfight and morale-crushing defeat in the uefa cup final .
the x factor is bremen , who despite a middling season in the league remain one of the few teams with the offensive firepower to compete with the wolves .
if werder show up to play , that could open the door for bayern and stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : bayern could have their hands full with stuttgart striker mario gomez those two teams square off in munich , with stuttgart on a roll and bayern trying to salvage at least second place from what 's been , by their standards , a humiliating season .
a draw would likely do nothing to satisfy either team 's ambitions so you can expect both squads to throw caution to the wind if the score is close in the later stages of the matches .
and if the testy exchanges between bayern and stuttgart 's players and management this week are an accurate indication , this is going to be a very ill-tempered affair .
spots in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha are also chasing their best finish ever in the bundesliga hertha berlin go into saturday in fourth and out of contention for the league championship , but they have their fate in their own hands regarding a place in the champions league .
because bayern or stuttgart or both will drop points this weekend , a victory for hertha against last-placed karlsruhe would guarantee berlin at least third place .
and if bayern and stuttgart draw , hertha could even shoot up to second and qualify directly for european football 's premier club competition .
but it wo n't be easy .
karlsruhe have the chance to move up to third to last , which would qualify them for a relegation tie against the third-best team from division two – with the winner staying in the top flight next season .
meanwhile dortmund can claim fifth place and a spot in the uefa europe league with a victory away to mönchengladbach .
but gladbach , who finally escaped the bottom three last week , will no doubt fight tooth and nail for the single point they need to ensure their survival in the top flight .
if dortmund do slip up , hamburg could write a conciliatory end to their dream-turned-nightmare season .
to do that , though , they 'll need at least a draw and probably a win against frankfurt .
the relegation battle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld fired michael frontzeck with only one game to play sandwiched in between gladbach -lrb- 30 points -rrb- and karlsruhe -lrb- 26 -rrb- are bielefeld and cottbus , who are both on 27 points .
the best-case scenario – a convincing win of their own together with bad losses for the competition - would see either team escape the drop zone entirely .
bielefeld are currently in 16th and have the advantage of playing at home against the league 's worst away team , hanover .
but the club is in utter chaos , having fired their coach this week and brought in veteran skipper joerg berger to oversee a campaign for survival that could only last a single match .
cottbus also play at home , and their opponents bayer leverkusen are even less predictable than bremen .
but owing to their inferior goal difference vis-à-vis , the best the eastern german club can realistically hope for is a chance at the relegation tie .
karlsruhe need both of cottbus and bielefeld to drop points to avoid going down .
but hope springs eternal , and hoping is what the majority of fans around germany will be doing on saturday , as probably the nost nail-biting bundesliga season ever draws to a conclusion .

but - with europeans hesitant to step in - the white house is under increasing pressure to find a solution . the us president 's order to close the guantanamo bay prison by january 2010 was hailed by democrats , republicans , civil-rights groups and the european union , but has since encountered stiff opposition from all sides on the question of what to do with the remaining 240 detainees .
in a speech at the national archives in washington , obama accused congress of using fear as a political tactic in voting to block the transfer of any of the detainees to prisons on us soil .
" i 've heard words that are calculated to scare people rather than educate them - words that have more to do with politics than protecting our country , " obama said on thursday , may 21 .
his own center-left democrats joined the minority republicans in the staggering 90-6 defeat of an $ 80-million -lrb- 58-million-euro -rrb- spending request to begin closing the controversial naval prison .
political headache bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's speech was symbolically staged in front of the us constitution at the national archives working out how to shut down the facility and either try inmates or send them to third countries has proved to be a political headache for the young obama administration .
forty-eight terror suspects currently held at guantanamo bay are waiting to be released to other nations as part of the white house effort to empty the cuba-based prison without bringing all its inmates to the united states , us officials said on thursday .
but european countries have been reluctant to step in and accommodate the detainees because they are believed to be posing high security risks .
only two prisoners have been released since january to us allies britain and france .
" my administration is in ongoing discussions with a number of other countries about the transfer of detainees to their soil for detention and rehabilitation , " obama said .
what would the voters say ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us lawmakers fear a voter backlash if guantanamo inmates end up in their constituencies us lawmakers , on the other hand do not want to see any of the detainees end up in their home states or districts in fear of a potential backlash from their voters .
they have argued that transferring the prisoners to us soil would place the american public at risk .
obama countered that keeping guantanamo open would further damage the us image in the world and undermine the war on terrorism .
" the problem of what to do with guantanamo detainees was not caused by my decision to close the facility , " obama said .
" the problem exists because of the decision to open guantanamo in the first place . "
according to the us president , guantanamo has already weakened american national security .
" it is a rallying cry for our enemies , " obama said .
" it sets back the willingness of our allies to work with us in fighting an enemy that operates in scores of countries .
by any measure , the costs of keeping it open far exceed the complications involved in closing it . "
cheney strikes back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dick cheney still champions the bush administration 's war on terror former vice president dick cheney , who has hit the airwaves in recent weeks to defend the policies during the bush years , shot back in a speech at the conservative american enterprise institute in washington that began minutes after obama concluded his .
cheney credited congressional democrats for joining republicans to criticize obama over guantanamo , and argued there were no good alternatives to keeping the prison open .
he accused obama of making a snap decision to close guantanamo without considering the consequences .
" the administration has found that it 's easy to receive applause in europe for closing guantanamo , " cheney said .
" but it 's tricky to come up with an alternative that will serve the interests of justice and america 's national security . "
democrats insist that obama first provide a plan before they dole out the money , but the president offered up few new details in his speech on thursday .
he did , however , say that some of the detainees will be brought to prisons inside the united states .
according to obama , the maximum-security facilities in the united states are adequate for holding dangerous detainees , and already house hardened criminals and previously convicted terrorists .
" if we try those terrorists in our courts and hold them in our prisons , then we can do the same with detainees from guantanamo , " obama said. tt / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hit the limits with my way of thought because i often had to deal with people who were unwilling to develop further , " klinsmann told german broadcaster stern tv this week .
" i wanted to take the next step . "
klinsmann was axed on april 27 with five games remaining in the season after a series of mediocre performances that have left the german giants two points behind leaders wolfsburg before the bundesliga finale this weekend .
he said his new training and fitness methods were met with resistance by club officials including president franz beckenbauer , manager uli hoeness and general manager karl-heinz rummenigge .
" they are all alpha males and also need their space , " he said .
" they are all personalities you have to work with . "
international ambitions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that bayern will get the trophy again this year klinsmann also partly blamed players for being more interested in dazzling fans on the international stage than at home .
bayern were eliminated in the champions league quarter-finals by barcelona .
" -lrb- the players -rrb- were very motivated for the champions league , " klinsmann said .
" but there was lack of consistency -lrb- in the league -rrb- .
they thought the bundesliga would run by itself .
we dropped silly points . "
a win against werder bremen on saturday would crown wolfsburg as german champions for the first time , although if they lose and bayern - now under caretaker coach jupp heynckes - win their final game against stuttgart , the munich team could still top the table .
" i will keep my fingers crossed for a miracle to happen and for bayern to become german champions , " klinsmann said .
" even though the title is more likely to go to wolfsburg . "
new coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis van gaal will bring a great deal of experience to munich experienced dutch coach louis van gaal , who has led az alkmaar to the dutch league title this season , has been chosen as klinsmann 's replacement .
he is to sign a two-year contract with munich beginning from july 1 .
he said he would take no players from az when he takes over as coach of the bundesliga club .
but the 57-year-old dutch coach will be accompanied by assistant andries jonker , currently technical director of club willem ii , who was also his assistant trainer at barcelona .
looking back on the time he spent in munich , klinsmann said he should have asked for three or four signings .
" it was a mistake to accept compromises because you are dealing with alpha males , " he said .
" one of the mistakes was to take over the squad that was given to me .
i should have been clear from the start and said ' i need three or four players ' .
i allowed myself to be convinced . "
despite all the difficulties his team faced in the bundesliga season , klinsmann said his departure from munich was premature .
" the most hurtful thing for me was feeling i could have finished the job , " he said .
" i could have led bayern to the german league title . " tt / dpa / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" over 4.6 million germans tuned in on thursday to watch the season finale of the popular casting show , hosted by international fashion icon and super-mom heidi klum .
fashion is a multicultural business .
heidi klum herself is married to pop singer seal , who was born to nigerian parents in london .
another jury member , fashion agent peyman amin was born in teheran , while casting director rolf scheider , also a juror , likes to present himself as a citizen of the world : a native of cologne , he speaks german with an accent that is an impossible - and often parodied - mixture of local , carnivalesque dialect and twittering french .
it should , therefore , not come as a surprise that germany got its first black top model .
sara nuru - whose fans proudly carried a large " yes she can " banner - won an advertising campaign with a german fashion brand , a car and a chance to appear on the cover of german cosmopolitan .
" i hope that - especially in germany - people will come to me when they need a dark-skinned model , " she said in an interview on friday .
" it 's just a skin color .
it 's the same with black or blond hair , it 's a question of what type is needed . "
a never-ending story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finalists sara , marie and mandy were all smiles on the show 's final evening those who expected cat fights and snide remarks on thursday evening were left wanting .
the most risqué moment of the hour-long final , which was aired live from a cologne arena in front of 15,000 enthusiastic fans , came when heidi klum told a strangely hyperactive photographer to talk less and concentrate on shooting the models on a mechanic rodeo bull .
other than that , the evening unrolled in a spirit of peace , love and understanding .
" i do n't see you as a competitor anymore , but a good friend , " one finalist told another .
" i 'm proud that we understand each other so well , " the other responded .
" i 'd like to thank you that you 've stood by side all along , " said the third .
yet if you think that " germany 's next top model " is all edelweiss in high heels , you 'll be wrong .
if you take away the attractive travel destinations , incessant commercial breaks , futile make-up tips and the towering presence of heidi klum , the show is still no more than a glitzy celebration of the nightmarish world of high-school trauma .
on the verge of a nervous breakdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all 's well that ends well highlights -lrb- or lowlights , depending on your point of view -rrb- of this season included victoria beckham , formerly posh spice and self-proclaimed fashion police expert , verbally abusing a 16-year old named sarina by accusing her of looking " too sexy " and even " bitchy . "
outspoken austrian contestant larissa marolt - who won the austrian version of the format earlier this year - was bullied by fellow competitors who refused to share a room with her .
she was told by one particularly rude rival " to go back to austria . "
early in the season , one contestant broke into tears while telling the jury that " a copy of her was running around . "
sensing the approach of an unforgettable emotional outburst , the jury pressed her for more information .
the contestant said she was convinced that a girl who had attended the same club as her several weeks earlier had been imitating her ever since .
but all the madness and social dysfunction of the previous three months were forgotten on thursday evening , when heidi klum announced sara 's triumph to the world .
in the end , there were tears and confetti , and klum 's high-pitched voice screeching in the viewers ' memory like an axe-murderer scene in a horror film .

the argentinean-born pianist and music director of berlin 's most respected opera house , staatsoper unter den linden , is one of the few artists in germany whose own life has been closely intertwined with the country 's and , in particular , berlin 's recent history .
" i 'm not just a jew or argentinean or musician who lives in germany , " barenboim told german news agency dpa this week .
" a modern person defines himself above all through the possibility to have several identities . "
difficult relationship born in 1942 in buenos aires , the grandson of russian emigrants , barenboim moved to israel in 1952 with his parents .
in 1954 , he was forced to turn down an invitation by his idol , renowned german conductor wilhelm furtwaengler , to play with the berlin philharmonic in the german capital after barenboim 's father raised objections .
the older barenboim felt that the time was n't ripe for a jewish musician to perform in germany just nine years after the end of the second world war and the fall of the nazis .
it was only in 1964 that barenboim traveled to berlin to play the piano on the 10th death anniversary of furtwaengler .
his next legendary performance in the city took place more than two decades later .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim conducted a legendary beethoven concert in berlin just days after the fall of the wall on november 12 , 1989 , just three days after the fall of the berlin wall , barenboim once again traveled to the freshly reunited german capital - this time to conduct what is now considered an iconic beethoven concert with the berlin philharmonic for the city 's new residents who had grown up in the communist eastern sector .
" realization of a utopia " a year after that concert , barenboim took over as music director of berlin 's staatsoper unter den linden located in former communist east berlin - a post he still holds and cherishes .
" in a way , the staatsoper is the realization of a utopia , " he told dpa .
" this is where we 've torn down the psychological wall between east and west .
when we practiced , we never thought that an east german should take up a particular position in the orchestra .
we did n't westernize the former east but rather we created something new from the former east and the former west . "
barenboim is also well known for founding the west-east divan orchestra in 1999 , together with late palestinian intellectual edward said .
it brings together young arab and israeli musicians and aims to promote dialogue and understanding between them . sp / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people want to see what others have got to say about the recession , " said festival director , peter florence .
according to mr florence , the festival in hay-on-wye has expanded by around 20 % this year .
" and for the first time in about 15 years , we are being promised a bit of sunshine , " he enthused . "
he is an extraordinary individual , probably one the world 's most admired christians " peter florence on archbishop tutu " there has been a real influx of people into the town already , it is very , very exciting .
" what we are seeing is the evening entertainment tickets are selling very , very well .

as the new indian government is getting down to business , industry has huge expectations .
the first issue to be tackled will be the deepening economic crisis , which has curbed growth of this once-buoyant economy to 6 % per year , its slowest rate in almost six years .
the bbc 's india business report has spoken to industry leaders in the country to identify their top four concerns .
economic growth almost 12 million new jobs need to be created every year in india harsh pati singhania , industrialist there has been sharp decline in demand for steel , iron and cement as residential and business construction and infrastructure development has slowed dramatically .
hopes that consumers would bolster economic growth have also been dashed .
harsh pati singhania is a fourth generation industrialist and he is worried that not enough is being done to boost growth .
" the country is not isolated , so whatever happens to the world will have an impact on india too , " he says .
" the government has already taken some steps " to stimulate economic growth , he says , such as boosting liquidity by injecting money into the economy along with fiscal stimulus .
" now that will really take time to trickle down , but basically our agenda needs to be two-fold , " he says .
mr singhania is calling for " investment-friendly growth " and is eager for the government to boost spending further .
" if the government comes out with a scheme to spend a huge amount of money on middle income or low income housing , then we are talking about major growth and more importantly there is a real need for it , " he says .
in india , government spending on infrastructure does more than merely create jobs ; it also meets a basic need for development , he points out .
mr singhania is also keen for the government to leave money in the hands of consumers .
consumer spending has slowed dramatically in india .
" this can be either through tax cuts or through bringing down interest rates , " he says .
" the liquidity introduced by the government has to flow from banks to consumers ' hands .
for individuals like you and me , there has to be cheaper credit available , for our housing loans or car loans or for our buying white goods .
cheap and accessible credit helps boost domestic demand , thus fuelling growth , as well as preserving and creating jobs , he insists .
" almost 12 million new jobs need to be created every year in india , " he says .
" about nine million new job seekers come into the market each year , and another three million from a backlog .
" that 's a large number and that can be achieved only through large spending schemes , or through growth . "
availability of credit india has one of the highest interest rates in the world krishan kalra , secretary general of the phd chamber of commerce lack of credit has held up several large infrastructure projects including highways , bridges and airports .
in the last couple of years , foreign investors have pumped in large amounts of money .
that has almost all dried up now .
local banks too have curbed lending .
the government has announced multiple aid packages to boost the economy .
yet many have been complaining that the money has not reached them because the banks are not actually lending the cash to industry .
also , the government now wants manufacturers to take the lead to keep the economy afloat .
this is just not possible , according to krishan kalra , secretary general of the phd chamber of commerce , which represents 45,000 small and medium manufacturers .
" this is a typical catch-22 situation , where the banks feel that if they lend their money to industry at this time , industry might lose the money and not be able to return it , " he says .
" but unless industry gets the money , banks would lose even what they have loaned earlier , " he reasons .
mr kalra is also concerned that in cases where the money is available , the rate of interest is just not affordable .
" india has one of the highest interest rates in the world , with credit being given at 12 % or 13 % to industry , " he says .
economic reform we would really wish to see a single market for agricultural produce and commodities chandrajit banerjee , director general of the confederation of indian industry in their last term in office , the upa government , led by the congress party , struggled to carry out key economic reforms because of opposition from its communist allies .
crucial economic reforms were put on hold because of a lack of consensus .
the insurance , banking and pension sectors had all been scheduled for reform , but the plans were not passed by the parliament .
chandrajit banerjee , director general of the confederation of indian industry , says it is important that the government now addresses these reforms on a fast-track basis .
" the agriculture sector has been the one of the biggest drivers of growth and a substantial part of the country 's gdp , but it still awaits reforms , " he says .
" we would really wish to see a single market for agricultural produce and commodities .
" in order to improve productivity in agriculture , the government policy should move from providing subsidies to increasing its investment in rural infrastructure . "
investment in rural infrastructure is crucial to boost the economy .
investments are also needed in rural infrastructure , such as irrigation , storage facilities , cold chains and rural roads .
after agriculture , the manufacturing sector is key for providing jobs to the large number of semi-skilled persons entering the work force every year .
" here , there needs to be greater flexibility of labour laws , " mr banerjee says .
" rigid labour raises the costs of companies and affect the manufacturing sector . "
mr banerjee is keenly waiting for the unified goods and services tax -lrb- gst -rrb- that is to be introduced on 1 april 2010 .
this will be important to the unification of the indian market .
but before that , he wants the government to come out with a detailed road map of and framework for the gst .
lastly , he wants to see financial reforms in areas such as banking , pensions and insurance .
the insurance bill would enable the government to raise the foreign direct investment limit in the insurance sector from 26 % to 49 % .
budget deficit take the risk of an unfortunate fiscal deficit , so that you can make it into a fortunate entity for the future through massive tax collection dr amit mitra , federation of indian chambers of commerce & industry the upa government had announced a number of initiatives , such as a waiver of crop loans to farmers and various stimulus packages to boost the economy .
but these measures have increased the fiscal deficit .
so the new government , looking to boost growth and put economic reforms on fast track , will face already-stretched public finances .
dr amit mitra from the federation of indian chambers of commerce & industry -lrb- ficci -rrb- thinks this can be an opportunity for the country .
" in india , unlike the united states or the united kingdom , when we lower taxes , the collection significantly out-paces the reduction , " he says .
" so the bright side of fiscal deficit is , if we can produce growth , which is what ought to come out of a ' keynesian multiplier ' , then you will see taxes going back into the government coffers . "
he also adds that the fiscal deficit poses a problem when the inflation rate can be affected .
" but india will have close to zero percent inflation soon . "
aiding farmers boosts india 's fiscal deficit , says critics .
therefore , he reasons , " the window is now when you can stimulate the economy " .
" take the risk of an unfortunate fiscal deficit , so that you can make it into a fortunate entity for the future through massive tax collection . "
india is facing some of the toughest conditions since independence , with the recession deepening in the country 's main export markets .
" yet here in delhi , the indian industry is hoping for the best even as the new government gets set to fix the economy . "

as the new indian government is getting down to business , industry has huge expectations .
the first issue to be tackled will be the deepening economic crisis , which has curbed growth of this once-buoyant economy to 6 % per year , its slowest rate in almost six years .
the bbc 's india business report has spoken to industry leaders in the country to identify their top four concerns .
economic growth almost 12 million new jobs need to be created every year in india harsh pati singhania , industrialist there has been sharp decline in demand for steel , iron and cement as residential and business construction and infrastructure development has slowed dramatically .
hopes that consumers would bolster economic growth have also been dashed .
harsh pati singhania is a fourth generation industrialist and he is worried that not enough is being done to boost growth .
" the country is not isolated , so whatever happens to the world will have an impact on india too , " he says .
" the government has already taken some steps " to stimulate economic growth , he says , such as boosting liquidity by injecting money into the economy along with fiscal stimulus .
" now that will really take time to trickle down , but basically our agenda needs to be two-fold , " he says .
mr singhania is calling for " investment-friendly growth " and is eager for the government to boost spending further .
" if the government comes out with a scheme to spend a huge amount of money on middle income or low income housing , then we are talking about major growth and more importantly there is a real need for it , " he says .
in india , government spending on infrastructure does more than merely create jobs ; it also meets a basic need for development , he points out .
mr singhania is also keen for the government to leave money in the hands of consumers .
consumer spending has slowed dramatically in india .
" this can be either through tax cuts or through bringing down interest rates , " he says .
" the liquidity introduced by the government has to flow from banks to consumers ' hands .
for individuals like you and me , there has to be cheaper credit available , for our housing loans or car loans or for our buying white goods .
cheap and accessible credit helps boost domestic demand , thus fuelling growth , as well as preserving and creating jobs , he insists .
" almost 12 million new jobs need to be created every year in india , " he says .
" about nine million new job seekers come into the market each year , and another three million from a backlog .
" that 's a large number and that can be achieved only through large spending schemes , or through growth . "
availability of credit india has one of the highest interest rates in the world krishan kalra , secretary general of the phd chamber of commerce lack of credit has held up several large infrastructure projects including highways , bridges and airports .
in the last couple of years , foreign investors have pumped in large amounts of money .
that has almost all dried up now .
local banks too have curbed lending .
the government has announced multiple aid packages to boost the economy .
yet many have been complaining that the money has not reached them because the banks are not actually lending the cash to industry .
also , the government now wants manufacturers to take the lead to keep the economy afloat .
this is just not possible , according to krishan kalra , secretary general of the phd chamber of commerce , which represents 45,000 small and medium manufacturers .
" this is a typical catch-22 situation , where the banks feel that if they lend their money to industry at this time , industry might lose the money and not be able to return it , " he says .
" but unless industry gets the money , banks would lose even what they have loaned earlier , " he reasons .
mr kalra is also concerned that in cases where the money is available , the rate of interest is just not affordable .
" india has one of the highest interest rates in the world , with credit being given at 12 % or 13 % to industry , " he says .
economic reform we would really wish to see a single market for agricultural produce and commodities chandrajit banerjee , director general of the confederation of indian industry in their last term in office , the upa government , led by the congress party , struggled to carry out key economic reforms because of opposition from its communist allies .
crucial economic reforms were put on hold because of a lack of consensus .
the insurance , banking and pension sectors had all been scheduled for reform , but the plans were not passed by the parliament .
chandrajit banerjee , director general of the confederation of indian industry , says it is important that the government now addresses these reforms on a fast-track basis .
" the agriculture sector has been the one of the biggest drivers of growth and a substantial part of the country 's gdp , but it still awaits reforms , " he says .
" we would really wish to see a single market for agricultural produce and commodities .
" in order to improve productivity in agriculture , the government policy should move from providing subsidies to increasing its investment in rural infrastructure . "
investment in rural infrastructure is crucial to boost the economy .
investments are also needed in rural infrastructure , such as irrigation , storage facilities , cold chains and rural roads .
after agriculture , the manufacturing sector is key for providing jobs to the large number of semi-skilled persons entering the work force every year .
" here , there needs to be greater flexibility of labour laws , " mr banerjee says .
" rigid labour raises the costs of companies and affect the manufacturing sector . "
mr banerjee is keenly waiting for the unified goods and services tax -lrb- gst -rrb- that is to be introduced on 1 april 2010 .
this will be important to the unification of the indian market .
but before that , he wants the government to come out with a detailed road map of and framework for the gst .
lastly , he wants to see financial reforms in areas such as banking , pensions and insurance .
the insurance bill would enable the government to raise the foreign direct investment limit in the insurance sector from 26 % to 49 % .
budget deficit take the risk of an unfortunate fiscal deficit , so that you can make it into a fortunate entity for the future through massive tax collection dr amit mitra , federation of indian chambers of commerce & industry the upa government had announced a number of initiatives , such as a waiver of crop loans to farmers and various stimulus packages to boost the economy .
but these measures have increased the fiscal deficit .
so the new government , looking to boost growth and put economic reforms on fast track , will face already-stretched public finances .
dr amit mitra from the federation of indian chambers of commerce & industry -lrb- ficci -rrb- thinks this can be an opportunity for the country .
" in india , unlike the united states or the united kingdom , when we lower taxes , the collection significantly out-paces the reduction , " he says .
" so the bright side of fiscal deficit is , if we can produce growth , which is what ought to come out of a ' keynesian multiplier ' , then you will see taxes going back into the government coffers . "
he also adds that the fiscal deficit poses a problem when the inflation rate can be affected .
" but india will have close to zero percent inflation soon . "
aiding farmers boosts india 's fiscal deficit , says critics .
therefore , he reasons , " the window is now when you can stimulate the economy " .
" take the risk of an unfortunate fiscal deficit , so that you can make it into a fortunate entity for the future through massive tax collection . "
india is facing some of the toughest conditions since independence , with the recession deepening in the country 's main export markets .
" yet here in delhi , the indian industry is hoping for the best even as the new government gets set to fix the economy . "

in 2005 , when he ditched the united democratic front -lrb- udf -rrb- , the party whose leader bakili muluzi ironically anointed him successor , pundits did not give the president a chance .
his then newly-founded democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- paled at the strength of the combined opposition in the just-dissolved parliament . "
the presidency is like a relay race " bingu wa mutharika q & a : elections in malawi but mr mutharika weathered the storm for five turbulent years to score a resounding victory in the presidential and parliamentary vote of the may 2009 general election .
born ryson webster thom in the tea-growing district of thyolo some 75 years ago , the school master 's son adopted the more african name bingu wa mutharika during the 1960s .
when founding father hastings kamuzu banda came to power in 1964 after malawi - then called nyasaland - became independent , mr mutharika became the first malawian administrator in the civil service , which was then still dominated by the british .
but during the so-called " cabinet crisis " in the same year , when some senior ministers rebelled against dr banda 's traits of dictatorship , the man destined one day for the top job fled malawi after rumours spread that the president believed he was in cahoots with the rebel ministers .
flight and disguise that was when he added the " wa " in his name to disguise his identity as a malawian .
at that time dr banda 's state machinery used to hunt down the former dictator 's opponents all over the world .
dr mutharika first went to zambia , then india where he studied development economics .
he later went to the united states where he obtained a doctorate in economics .
then begun a long career as an international civil servant .
bingu , as he is popularly known , started off at the world bank in washington and the economic commission for africa in addis ababa , ethiopia .
he then became secretary-general of the regional trading bloc - the preferential trade area -lrb- pta -rrb- - in lusaka , zambia .
when the pta transformed itself into common market for the eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- in 1995 , mr mutharika became its founding secretary-general .
the economist-turned-politician 's ambition to rule malawi dates back to as early as 1992 when he became a founding member of the then underground political pressure group , the udf .
it would rule malawi for 10 years after the first multiparty general elections in 1994 .
mr mutharika drafted the udf 's first manifesto and expressed interest to stand as a udf candidate in the 1994 election .
fall from grace but he was upstaged by supporters of businessman and former banda protege , bakili muluzi .
mr muluzi prevailed over mr mutharika on the premise that the latter had been out of malawi for far too long .
mr mutharika was forced to leave comesa amid allegations of financial mismanagement .
he , however , vehemently denies this , saying it was his political opponents back home who initiated his fall from grace .
back in malawi , mr mutharika had a go at the presidency in the 1999 elections as a candidate for the little-known united party .
he ended up the last among the five candidates .
then he melted into the political wilderness , only to resurface from hibernation as a surprise presidential candidate for the udf after retiring president muluzi failed in his bid to elongate his tenure of office beyond his constitutional two five-year terms .
mr muluzi , who dubbed himself the " political engineer " , sold mr mutharika as the " economic engineer " . "
i believe the dpp will win these elections because the work of my hands will speak for me " bingu wa mutharika john tembo : poised for power ?
not a naturally charismatic public speaker , mr mutharika relied on mr muluzi to do all the campaigning - so much so that it was a complete surprise that the two fell out immediately after the elections .
mr mutharika blamed his quitting the udf on his former political allies , whom he accused of frowning upon his tough anti-corruption drive .
but his move ignited his political problems in parliament since the udf was angry that it spent so much energy on bingu the candidate , only to be relegated to opposition ranks by bingu the president .
the udf joined hands with the main opposition malawi congress party -lrb- mcp -rrb- to give him a tough time in parliament .
most government bills were shot down by the combined opposition and the president had to struggle for months to pass his budgets .
film scripts but despite all this he believed the nation was behind him - and his trust was not misplaced .
" the opposition tried all they could to frustrate my government but they failed miserably , " he said , before winning his second term .
mr mutharika , a church-going catholic , married his childhood sweetheart ethel , who had roots in both malawi and zimbabwe .
the first lady , who had cancer , died last year .
the mutharikas have four grown children .
in his spare time mr mutharika told the bbc news that he dabbles in both non-fiction and fiction writing .
he has published a number of books on business and says he has two scripts for possible feature films .
unlike most african leaders , mr mutharika has promised to retire from active politics after seeing off his second term in 2014 .
" the presidency is like a relay race , " he says .
" when you run your bit you give it to the other to continue . "

in 2005 , when he ditched the united democratic front -lrb- udf -rrb- , the party whose leader bakili muluzi ironically anointed him successor , pundits did not give the president a chance .
his then newly-founded democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- paled at the strength of the combined opposition in the just-dissolved parliament .
the presidency is like a relay race bingu wa mutharika q & a : elections in malawi but mr mutharika weathered the storm for five turbulent years to score a resounding victory in the presidential and parliamentary vote of the may 2009 general election .
born ryson webster thom in the tea-growing district of thyolo some 75 years ago , the school master 's son adopted the more african name bingu wa mutharika during the 1960s .
when founding father hastings kamuzu banda came to power in 1964 after malawi - then called nyasaland - became independent , mr mutharika became the first malawian administrator in the civil service , which was then still dominated by the british .
but during the so-called " cabinet crisis " in the same year , when some senior ministers rebelled against dr banda 's traits of dictatorship , the man destined one day for the top job fled malawi after rumours spread that the president believed he was in cahoots with the rebel ministers .
flight and disguise that was when he added the " wa " in his name to disguise his identity as a malawian .
in 2004 bakili muluzi -lrb- front -rrb- campaigned for mr mutharika -lrb- behind -rrb- at that time dr banda 's state machinery used to hunt down the former dictator 's opponents all over the world .
dr mutharika first went to zambia , then india where he studied development economics .
he later went to the united states where he obtained a doctorate in economics .
then begun a long career as an international civil servant .
bingu , as he is popularly known , started off at the world bank in washington and the economic commission for africa in addis ababa , ethiopia .

when the pta transformed itself into common market for the eastern and southern africa -lrb- comesa -rrb- in 1995 , mr mutharika became its founding secretary-general .
the economist-turned-politician 's ambition to rule malawi dates back to as early as 1992 when he became a founding member of the then underground political pressure group , the udf .
it would rule malawi for 10 years after the first multiparty general elections in 1994 .
mr mutharika drafted the udf 's first manifesto and expressed interest to stand as a udf candidate in the 1994 election .
fall from grace but he was upstaged by supporters of businessman and former banda protege , bakili muluzi .
john tembo is viewed by many as the incumbent 's main challenger mr muluzi prevailed over mr mutharika on the premise that the latter had been out of malawi for far too long .
mr mutharika was forced to leave comesa amid allegations of financial mismanagement .
he , however , vehemently denies this , saying it was his political opponents back home who initiated his fall from grace .
back in malawi , mr mutharika had a go at the presidency in the 1999 elections as a candidate for the little-known united party .
he ended up the last among the five candidates .
then he melted into the political wilderness , only to resurface from hibernation as a surprise presidential candidate for the udf after retiring president muluzi failed in his bid to elongate his tenure of office beyond his constitutional two five-year terms .
mr muluzi , who dubbed himself the " political engineer " , sold mr mutharika as the " economic engineer " .
i believe the dpp will win these elections because the work of my hands will speak for me bingu wa mutharika john tembo : poised for power ?
not a naturally charismatic public speaker , mr mutharika relied on mr muluzi to do all the campaigning - so much so that it was a complete surprise that the two fell out immediately after the elections .
mr mutharika blamed his quitting the udf on his former political allies , whom he accused of frowning upon his tough anti-corruption drive .
but his move ignited his political problems in parliament since the udf was angry that it spent so much energy on bingu the candidate , only to be relegated to opposition ranks by bingu the president .
the udf joined hands with the main opposition malawi congress party -lrb- mcp -rrb- to give him a tough time in parliament .
most government bills were shot down by the combined opposition and the president had to struggle for months to pass his budgets .
film scripts but despite all this he believed the nation was behind him - and his trust was not misplaced .
" the opposition tried all they could to frustrate my government but they failed miserably , " he said , before winning his second term .
mr mutharika , a church-going catholic , married his childhood sweetheart ethel , who had roots in both malawi and zimbabwe .
the first lady , who had cancer , died last year .
the mutharikas have four grown children .
in his spare time mr mutharika told the bbc news that he dabbles in both non-fiction and fiction writing .
he has published a number of books on business and says he has two scripts for possible feature films .
unlike most african leaders , mr mutharika has promised to retire from active politics after seeing off his second term in 2014 .

mr medvedev was speaking at the end of a russia-eu summit held against a background of deep divisions over security , trade and energy supplies .
he also signalled a new gas crisis may lie ahead , suggesting ukraine lacks the money to pay for gas russia provides .
a row over prices severely affected supplies to europe in january .
the bbc 's richard galpin in moscow says divisions between russia and the european union seem to be growing ever wider , and this latest summit , held in the far east of russia , made that abundantly clear , with little sign of progress on any significant topic .
' anti-russian bent ' " we would not want the eastern partnership to turn into partnership against russia .
there are various examples , " mr mevedev told a news conference at the end of the summit .
" i would simply not want this partnership to consolidate certain individual states , which are of an anti-russian bent , with other european states , " he said .
moscow has accused the 27-member bloc of creating new dividing lines in europe by offering closer ties to six former soviet republics .
the eastern partnership initiative aims to forge close political and economic ties in exchange for democratic reforms .
armenia , azerbaijan , belarus , georgia , moldova and ukraine have signed up to the initiative , which seeks to bolster stability in the region .
however it does not offer the prospect of eventual eu membership .
divisive issue on the divisive issue of energy supplies , president medvedev raised questions about whether ukraine can afford billions of dollars to top up its gas stocks .
" we have doubts about ukraine 's ability to pay , " he said .
he also proposed that moscow and the eu should help ukraine get a loan for gas payments .
ukraine has denied there is any problem .
russia supplies 42 % of eu gas imports .
its decision to cut all gas to ukraine - a vital transit country - meant that many eu member states also lost their supplies of gas for two weeks in january .
speaking in khabarovsk , european commission president jose manuel barroso warned there should be no more disruptions to gas supplies from russia .

by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news anyone watching mps debate emergency reforms to their expenses system will not have detected a whiff of revolution in the air .
it felt like business as usual in the commons chamber - the same exaggerated courtesy between " honourable members " , the same self-congratulatory jokes .
there was little sense that the ground was shifting beneath the mps as they spoke .
yet that is what a growing body of opinion believes could be happening - that we are witnessing the dying spasms of a centuries old and peculiarly british way of doing democracy .
indeed , so shaken has the political establishment been by the expenses scandal that they are suddenly contemplating all kinds of ideas they had previously rejected as unwise , unworkable or hopelessly idealistic .
these include -lrb- but are not limited to -rrb- : • proportional representation - ending what critics see as the inherently unfair " first-past-the-post " system of electing mps • fixed term parliaments - ending the advantage to the ruling party of choosing the polling date • a written constitution - setting out voters ' rights and limiting the power of government • a fully elected second chamber - ending the power of patronage and expelling the few remaining hereditary peers • curbing the power of the whips - freeing mps to to vote with their conscience more often rather than following the party line • fixed terms for mps - so they do not become too cosy and complacent in their roles • boosting the power of select committees - electing the chairmen rather than having them chosen by the whips and handing them greater investigatory powers it could all be a mirage of course .
once there has been a clear out of the bad apples deemed to have broken the rules on allowances , things may well return to normal in the palace of westminster .
public pressure there are plenty about the place who would warn against rash action based on a few weeks ' bad headlines , and argue that parliament works perfectly well as it is , all things considered .
even those gripped by a zeal for reform could see it steadily dissipated in the familiar round of committees and working groups currently being set up , until everyone starts yawning and wondering what the fuss was about and the media caravan moves on to the next crisis .
douglas carswell , the backbench conservative mp whose commons motion helped trigger the downfall of commons speaker michael martin , believes the window of opportunity for those who want change will last about 12 months .
the reformers ' secret weapon , he argues , is public pressure exerted through blogs and e-mail .
" what is going to change things is the internet .
it removes barriers to entry to politics .
it means westminster insiders no longer have the monopoly on political opinion . "
mr carswell is something of a rarity .
most new mps put their head down and get on with the job of climbing westminster 's greasy pole , while at the same time , as we have learned in recent weeks , being inducted into the dark arts of the expenses system .
career suicide but the harwich mp , who was elected in 2005 , refused to play the game almost from the start , speaking openly of his " revulsion " at the system and how , frankly , he was embarrassed to be an mp .
it was career suicide , in conventional westminster terms , but to his own surprise it appears to have paid off .
in his book , the plan , co-authored with tory mep daniel hannan , who recently became a worldwide hit on youtube with an attack on gordon brown , mr carswell sets out 28 steps to " renew our broken democracy " and " get our supine , spineless parliament off its knees " . "
the expenses crisis has awakened in voters the need for radical change - that can only come by changing the rules of politics " ken ritchie , electoral reform society the first two steps were a clean-up of the mps expenses system and the removal of speaker michael martin .
mission accomplished there , he might claim , but the real key to change does not lie exclusively within parliament itself , he argues , but in the way mps are selected and kept in line by over-mighty party machines .
as long as " seven out of 10 mps believe they have a job for life , " he says , there will be scope for " corruption " of the kind seen over expenses .
' whips ' patsies ' he wants open primaries , in which all voters in a constituency get to choose the candidates that will stand for labour , the conservatives , lib dems and the rest rather than party selection committees .
and he believes voters should be given the power to recall their mps if they are doing a bad job .
he is also calling , along with 24 of his tory colleagues from the 2005 intake , for more direct democracy - allowing part of the queen 's speech setting out the government 's legislative programme to be decided by public petition .
critics have argued that many of these ideas would undermine rather than strengthen democracy , leading to endless , vexatious attempts to de-select mps , wreck candidate selection and give voice to the lunatic fringe .
mr carswell argues that they work in america , where open primaries and direct democracy have long been part of the political landscape .
it is , he argues , the only way to hand a little self-respect back to the average backbench mp .
" if we get to the stage where we have a general election where every single person returned as an mp had to go through a genuinely competitive contest to get there then i would be proud to be an mp .
" until that happens , we are all the whips ' patsies to some degree . "
dying democracy the tory mp may go further than most in his calls for a westminster revolution - but he is hardly a lone voice in calling for reform .
barely a week goes by at westminster without a seminar or speech on boosting " engagement " with voters .
the 2006 power commission , chaired by labour peer baroness kennedy , came up with a whole list of reforms it said was vital to save britain 's dying democracy . "
i believe we can drag parliament into the 20th century at least , if not the 21st century " norman baker , liberal democrat these included an end to first-past-the-post elections at westminster and the closed party list system used in european elections , limiting the power of the whips , decentralising power to local councils , tighter regulation of quangos and lobbyists , lowering the voting age to 16 and a cap on party donations .
for the liberal democrats and others , including a surprising number of labour ministers , the key is an end to the first-past-the-post electoral system .
ken ritchie , chief executive of the electoral reform society , says : " the expenses crisis has awakened in voters the need for radical change - that can only come by changing the rules of politics .
" we want to see a referendum on the voting system at the next general election so we can let people decide the playing field for politics . "
gurkha rights lib dem mp norman baker , who has led the campaign for more transparency in parliament , is also a strong supporter of electoral reform but , he adds , " the essential thing is to re-balance the power between the executive and parliament " .
this means strengthening the independence and clout of the average backbench mp to hold the government to account and overturn unpopular legislation - something that currently happens so rarely that it makes front page news when it does , as in the recent vote on gurkha settlement rights .
there is also the question of parliament 's rules and procedures - which are sometimes a mystery even to mps themselves - and the archaic language used in the chamber , which mr baker believes distances politicians from those who pay their wages .
that is why the identity of the next speaker - who will be elected by a secret ballot of mps for the first time - will be so important , he argues , although he laughs off suggestions it could be him , saying that would be the " nuclear option " for mps .
parliament cherishes its rituals and traditions and the speaker has traditionally seen his or her role as a defender of them - but the pressure will be on the next incumbent to bring about reform .
brown 's big idea and although mps have proved remarkably resilient at resisting change , mr baker believes there is now a " real head of steam " .
" i believe we can drag parliament into the 20th century at least , if not the 21st century , " he adds .
when gordon brown gained power two years ago , constitutional reform was his big idea .
the plans he floated , such as giving mps the final say over going to war and confirmation hearings for public appointments , are not as far reaching as those being discussed now and were kicked into the long grass by the economic crisis .
but mr brown is said to be open to many ideas that have previously been rejected and is considering a special " constitutional convention " to discuss them .
he has also promised an end to the " gentleman 's club " arrangement , which saw mps set their own rules .
tory leader david cameron has also made positive noises about reform - including cutting the number of mps and slashing unelected quangos .
lib dem leader nick clegg , who has long tried to cast himself as a revolutionary force on this issue , has called the current crisis a once-a-generation opportunity to change politics for good .
but in the end , it will be down to the public , at the next election , to decide whether democratic reform - previously seen as a rather dusty and arcane subject - is up there with the economy and public services as one of their top priorities at the ballot box .
and whether the new intake of mps - many of whom may be voted in specifically to clean up the system - will be able to bring about the changes demanded by voters or whether , like generations of new mps before them , they will be seduced by the history and splendour of their surroundings and gradually lose interest .
perhaps they will discover , as revolutionaries throughout the ages have claimed , that you can not change the system from within .
thanks for the hundreds of e-mails you have sent us on this subject .
the following reflect the balance of the views received .
ultimately it is a question of mutual respect .
power has corrupted .
the executive has to a large extent viewed the mp 's as voting fodder organised through the whipping system and controlled so much else through patronage .
mp 's for their part like their safe seats and have been loath to change the iniquitous first past the post system which guarantees that most voters wishes will be ignored .
and the public views the whole lot of them , not unreasonably , as being motivated primarily by self interest .
hopefully this ' crisis ' of thir own making will result in a real democracy based on trust both ways .
this means giving power back to the people .
it is called democracy .
ralp wood , appleby-in-westmorland the only honourable thing left to do now is to hold a general election .
let every mp stand up to be counted no matter what their political leanings and let the public decide .
we have been robbed by the corrupt financial institutions and business leaders , we are being ripped off by a corrupt gravy train called the eu and now by parliament all in the name of self interest .
the british people are plainly angry and a fresh parliament is the only way left to help restore some respect in our leaders .
david fidkin , stone staffordshire an interesting article .
a reform of parliament is long overdue -lrb- was this not what tony blair was originally voted in to do ? ! ! -rrb- the sooner we rid ourselves of this archaic and anachronistic pantomime the better it will be for us all .
our much hyped " british democracy " is not what it seems and urgent reform is a necessity .
graham paterson , leicester , u.k. what utter twaddle !
it 'll take more than an expenses scandal for mps to decide to ruin this country 's constitution .
you 've failed to explain how these reforms would reduce corruption .
if anything , with the extension of elections to other fields , and the likelihood of cross-party collusion in regular hung parliaments , corruption would increase !
a written constitution would be pointless , too .
and while i have sympathy for the complaint that whips have much control over mps ' voting habits , the flipside is that disciplined voting increases accountability of the parties as it 's easy to determine what the party 's voting record is .
it really is not good enough to derogatise the current system without looking at the impact of the reforms you propose .
each one of them would worsen the political environment we live in .
adrian kidney , norwich time the countries system of electing mp 's was changed .
it is disgraceful that the present labour government was elected with less than a quarter of the vote .
the idea of local selection is also good as it will stop the ofspring of political figures being foisted on the people .
new system for the next general election please , only please do not lower the voting age to 16 , since when were children deemed responsible ?
john barton , alnwick , england i believe in one of the best quotes ever made by billy connolly .
" anyone with the desire to become a politician should automatically be barred from ever being one ! "
if this was a rule we would n't be in the mess we are now .
too much self interest and greed is all i can see in westminster .
scottish independence now !
paul reynolds , bathgate most of the suggested changes are hardly groundbreaking - simply sensible , reasonable and necessary .
it is surprising though that those who have forced change on moral and financial grounds in just about every other public service have carried on doing exactly those things ; let them eat cake !
mark jordan , cardiff change ?
who will make this happen ?
not the oinks in the trough .
they are having a great time of things just as they are .
not the sub-species on benefits , or else what would they do if their benefits were stopped ?
not the immigrants .
the freebies and slothfulness of our elected officials are the very reason they came here in the first place .
so who exactly ?
the indigenous population ?
i doubt it .
the prozac generation are too apathetic to change anything .
most can not get their heads further than the next football match .
nope .
it will be a case of the more things change , the more they stay the same .
britain 's economy will slide a little further down the international ranks .
our yoof will grow a little more violent .
the pensioners will grumble each winter and the unmarried mothers will continue to whine about how hard their lives are .
the salford by-election proves it. the british can not change .
they are trapped in the mirror of their dominions past , their mindless tit-for-tat pursuits of the class war , their weekend allotments , their feeble understanding of anything beyond their own borders .
poor england !
a bit like a great aunt really ; once the matriarch , now largely an irrelevance , with deference shown merely because it is the decent thing to do .
when finally she passes on , no one will really notice .
marginal review , maidstone , kent how arrogant .
my wife came here as an immigrant and has n't taken a penny off the state -lrb- in fact she paid thousands of pounds to the state via university fees -rrb- , and works very hard as a doctor in an nhs trust where british doctors do n't want to work .
your discourteous behaviour is the real problem with britain .
jim mcnulty , uk why do we need 647 mp 's when 500 are wasted as voting fodder ?
all the present lot , without exception , should claim the chiltern hundred when the next election is called .
in the meantime , why do n't the ' hon ' members do the honourable thing and reform parliament for a new government ?
ray merrall , edinburgh democracy in the uk has long been described as an ' elective dictatorship ' and in other , less flattering terms .
that it does n't reflect the etimological ideal of ' rule by the common people ' , does n't necessarily mean that the uk needs to abandon its tried-and-tested version of democracy and go all out for whole sale reform .
the roots of the current failings of the system lie not in an expenses scandal -lrb- oh , what a shock to discover politicians fiddling the books ! -rrb- but rather in the series of reforms made since the early twentieth century for reasons of necessity , of basic rights , and of simple party politics .
no-one would deny that extending the popular vote to women was the right thing to do , however in later years of the 20th century ministers started to distinguish between ' accountability ' and ' responsibility ' , wriggling their way out of blunders that would have led their predecessors to resign on principle .
and in the blair years the government -lrb- in the eyes of many analyst ! s and legal advisers -rrb- broke the laws and the very constitution of the land in riding roughshod over the will of parliament .
that the constitution is n't codified certainly is problematic as it has allowed recent governments to do pretty much whatever they please , regardless of long-established parliamentary principles , on the simple and spurious notion that they have a popular mandate .
the growth in power of the executive branch has gone unchecked for far too long , and needs to be seriously curtailed .
in general , however , i do n't believe that the uk 's political system is in any desparate need for reform .
tom , hong kong proportional representation is the dumbest idea ever .
we do n't even use it here in america .
such practices , epecially in multi-party systems leads to a destabalized government and chaos .
tyler quebedeaux , church point , la .
u.s.a. brian wheeler thinks you might not be able to change the system from within : that 's what they 've got us for , mate .
we are going to change the system - no more free rides or jollies .
make them continuously accountable .
carswell has the right idea .
john olsson , welshpool it 's not the constitution that 's at fault , it 's the self-serving politicians .
all we need are tougher rules to keept them in line .
if the government ca n't even get comparatively simple things right , like the ghurka debacle , then how can we expect them to successfully change the constitution ?
the british constitution is an extremely intricate and delicate thing and should n't be tinkered with .
i suspect all we 'd end up with is something that worked far less efficiently than the current system .
james , liverpool , uk we need better informed debate in parliament , faster decisioning making and more review of the executive ; so first improvement get rid of this nonsense of " honourable " tag - speed up debate and act as reminder they collectively allowed a scandalous system to continue. larry young , glasgow hopefully we can speed things up a bit by signing this : http : / / petitions.number10.gov.uk / please-go / kalvis jansons , hitchin , herts perhaps one of the main reforms to the parliamentary system would be to introduce compulsory voting .
this would go someway to eliminate the voter apathy allowed to fester in the u.k. the preferential voting system works perfectly well in australia where in my opinion has the fairest democratic system in the world .
colin smart , melbourne i do n't think changing the system will do anything .
the important thing is whether the mps are out of touch with real life .
that 's the issue .
the expense claims are n't important .
whether they 're a person that would do such a thing is n't important .
what 's important was their understanding of how real life is for the ordinary citizen was so bad that they got caught out .
we do n't need to change the system , we need mps with better understanding of what life is like for the downtrodden masses rather than existing in a middle class vacuum .
robin arnold , wolverhampton , uk .
the number of members of parliament should be reduced to about 450 .
also should be a minimum requirement for the members present in the house for a debate .
mr e w pitts , studley warwickshire i think we all know now that the practice of parachuting favoured members of a party into ' safe seats ' has been a cause of the rot .
constituents should be electing people in their communities who they know and trust who has lived amongst them for decades .
they do n't want some ambitious stranger using these constituencies as springboards for their careers and who : * ca n't wait to leave the place on weekends . * do n't understand the spirit of the constituency and its unique set of qualities and problems .
there should be primaries to select each and every candidate , rather than leaving that to the discretion of the parties because the latter method is not democratic and it leads to voter apathy .
we should even consider primaries for the pm and ensure that we are never again lumbered with an unelected pm , regardless of his / her hue .
douglas carswell is spot on .
if we are to expel the few remaining hereditary peers and instead , elect peers -lrb- fewer in number , though -rrb- , what are we to do with those who received their peerages for ' service ' to incumbent governments .
perhaps all those who wish to remain peers should submit themselves to an election - which should be entirely open and above board .
secret ballots , nods and winks should go .
in this age of information at everyone 's fingertips , the need for transparency has never been greater .
any written constitution must be written with extreme care and should be deliberated upon for as long as it takes to thrash out the issues and iron out the wrinkles .
no guillotining .
no stifling of debate .
no holds barred .
the result should serve to limit what the government can do and should assume basic inalienable rights just as the american constitution does .
jen cook , i would support all of the ideas discussed in this article , from proportional represenation onwards .
it sounds too good to be true though .
also as this article suggests i worry that when the media stop reporting on the expenses scandal that the pressure will be off and things will go back to normal .
i also did n't know that a tory mp had written a book on this much needed change , it sounds like douglas carswell talks a lot of common sense .
matt , huntingdon , england there should be a petition on the number 10 website stating that the uk has lost confidence in its mps and there should be a general election before the summer recess so that civil servants etc can organise new procedures over the summer ready for a new government in the autumn .
helen shepherd , harrow you may be interested to express your opinion at the following website i have just set up www.aloudvoice.com , to capture the public 's views in a way that can not be ignored .
neil , droitwich i 'm sorry but in my opinion , reforms would have to be almost total for any parliament to get to a place where it fairly represents the true wishes of the people without enforcing the majority view on the inevitable dissenting minority .
democracy has a fundamental flaw you see .
it can be defined as " two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for lunch " .
captain frantic , pontypool , wales diane abbott made an interesting point tonight on bbc 1 that it has been suggested that the labour party has nothing to lose , anyway .
david cameron is therefore , arguably , the most powerful person this country has seen since churchill in 1940 .
if he goes with the above ideas this country will genuinely change .
a direct influence on government , with consequences , may even be a maturing influence on the citizens as well as our politicians .
i live in woodford green , so i do n't vote , of course .
it 's not one of the constituencies that can change hands in an election because of its demographic .
it never has and it never will .
nothing to do with me , at all .
mike , london 1 .
compulsory voting for the electorate , the opt out is to spoil one 's vote and then be counted that way .
our governance should not be decided by a few .
2 proportional representation .
3 free voting for mp 's to end ' party straight jacket ' and so make them accountable to their constituents needs .
all this after sweeping reform to the remuneration of mp 's & ministers .
frances , shropshire england i am not sure what i think of most of the suggested reforms , but i am sure they will not reduce corruption .
i suggest the authors actually take a look at what happens in other countries .
did fixed terms stop someone trying to sell obama 's senate seat ?
and you will find that proportional representation increases the power of party machines because it is through the machines that a prospective candidate gets on the party list .
you will also find that it is coalition governments where corruption and malfeasance is most difficult to police : the last new zealand government was basically clean but had a scandal prone foreign minister from a minor party .
in the uk the minister would have been out of the job , but it takes a brave prime minister to let their government fall because a minister from the coalition party is doing something minor like fiddling expenses -lrb- in the nz case it was election expenses -rrb- . tony , wellington , new zealand david starkey 's suggestion of separating the prime minister and the cabinet from the legislature seems worth considering .
it would give more power to the prime minister in selecting ministers , but also give them a wider pool to choose from .
in some cases it could facilitate selection of the right person for the job - regardless of political affiliation - as seen by president obama retaining robert gates as the us defense secretary .
it could also free up the commons and lords from the whips rule and enable them to really scrutinise government proposals / actions / legislation .
ken rennoldson , bristol i 'm as much of an advocate of political reform as the next idealistic politics student .
but from what i 've gleaned from my studies , we need to be realistic .
what government is going to bite the hand that feeds it ?
the appointed lords stand as the greatest obstacle to reform .
our only hope for any real democratic development is for this government or the next to finally let the public decide who fills those red benches .
dan , durham " let he who is without sin . "
clean up the system ?
yes ... but not at the expense of the honest sitting members .
we in fareham are very fortunate in this respect ... an mp to respect and trust , who does a great deal for all constituents .
ivor dugdale-jenkins , fareham , hampshire excellent article .
clearly the uk system works , it just does n't work that well anymore .
i think it is about time the uk had a written constitution and had a fully elected upper house , just like in canada , the usa and australia .
the fixed term for parliament is also an excellent idea .
the snp might have succeeded in changing the political landscape already - you could be in for a hung parliament next time around !
interesting times .
neil , montreal , canada would n't it be great if whips were removed altogether from the political process , so that all mps can vote on what they believe , and what is good for their constituents , rather than voting which ever way they are told to by the whips .
after all , politicians are meant to be acting on behalf of us .
p hunt , leeds , england 1 .
no individual to serve for more than two of the fixed terms .
2 at least five years experience in local government before being considered for the national parliament .
pete macgregor , bradford on avon , uk be very carefull with changing your first past the post system .
in australia it has given just one or two people , the power to control the whole system , and not even be on the elected list , say the greens put up two people but get 2 % giving them 3 spots then they can put in anyone they like to fill the 3rd spot .
last year one person refused to pass a bill untill he was promised over 700 hundred million to be spent in his electrice .
be carefull what you wish for ron arnfield , perth ausytalia roll on democracy , swiss-style direct democracy .
at no point in the entire history of britain have the people ever expressed - in a referendum - their desire to have all political power monopolised by -lrb- so-called -rrb- " representatives " .
it is the people who should be allowed to decide - directly - on reforms to their government , not self-serving professional politicians who have proven themselves untrustworthy .
let the people decide , directly .
it is - after all - their country .
is n't it ? ? ? ? ? ?
stephen morris , the last thing we should do in these difficult times would be to rush into fundamental change of our governance .
evolution is always better than revolution .
we must settle down , get through the current crisis , sort out the public debt and then give real thought to the way forward .
roger parkes , t wells " they sentenced me to 20 years of boredom , for tryin ' to change the system from within , i 'm coming now , i 'm coming to reward them , first we take manhatten , then we take berlin ! -lrb- with thanks to leonard cohen . -rrb-
peter o 'brien , bristol the balance between parliament and executive has shifted far to far towards government which has amounted to an elected dictatorship .
amongst other reforms , there needs to be greater power for select committees , no executive -lrb- government -rrb- interference in the appointment of select committee chairs and membership ; greater power to be taken by the house over the parliamentary time-table ; an end to enquiries where the terms of reference are set by those who are to be scrutinised and the house must have the power to set up public enquiries and set the terms of reference .
parliament should run on fixed terms of no more than four years but the power of the house to bring down an executive -lrb- by a vote of no confidence -rrb- must remain .
the second chamber must be wholly elected and there should be considerably more interaction between the two houses through the select committee system .
both houses should be reduced in numbers and the number of government departments and ministers within dep ! artments should also be reduced .
qangos , which are not a formal part of the state structure , should be brought under proper parliamentary scrutiny and control and almost certainly reduced in number and public appointments should be subject to scrutiny .
reform must also be made of the ways and means of candidate selection in order to reduce the power of the political parties - it is ironic that it was not so long ago that party membership was not given on election ballot papers .
kit powell-williams , london it 's all window dressing .
we 'll see no progress at all until the ultimate symbol of our rotten undemocratic system - the monarchy - is abolished .
stephen simpson , lerwick we must without question make parliament more truly representative of the people 's wishes and both able to and accountable for holding government to account .
we can not continue with a system in which the elected party , which typically only receives 30 % or less of the vote , is able to take such absolute control .
that way has taken us into iraq , has led us to economic catastrophy , has undertaken massive immigration without consultation : it is hard to argue against proportional representation .
roy jones , maidenhead , berks it 's about time the whips were reigned in .
if mps had been allowed to vote with their conscience rather than being told to ' tow the party line ' or to ' stay on message ' then the recent history of this country would n't be as dark as it is .
well done to all the mps that are demanding the re-introduction of democracy and a fair , just and accountable system of government .
stephanie lewis , milton keynes , buckinghamshire yes yes yes , to many of the above suggestions and changes needed but how does the great british public throw off -lrb- or at least lesson -rrb- , the yoke of the party system .
it is primarily only interested in its own self-perpetuation .
things have got to change !
monty larkin , uckfield the terms for mp 's seems very reasonable .
if it was in before we probably would n't have this whole expenses scandal situation .
the people we rely have taken money they do n't need .
i 'm sure a great percentage of the public can no longer trust them , how can we continue to trust them to run things ?
many of those ideas seem very ideal for these times .
allan , uk i applaud douglas carswell 's ideas .
what a joy to read .
what mps and the bbc for that matter fail to grasp is that we -lrb- voters -rrb- are going to change things not them .
those who think they can just rearrange the seating in the hoc and put up a few new posters are crackers .
we will get openess and acccountability .
we will be heard and our get the kind of country we want to live in - not a socially engineered one by labour and her friends .
wake up !
mrs crabbitwifey , planet hope let 's hope that this expenses scandal can bring about wholesale reform as this article suggests .
however , it requires reformers , both amongst mps and in the general public to come together , perhaps by forming some kind of pressure group or party , to really push the reform agenda .
we need changes which have been properly thought through and which are fair and sensible , not something cobbled together by leaders of the main parties to just win them the next election .
the issue that particularly concerns me is party funding .
i find it outrageous that under the present constitutional settlement this could be decided by some cobbled together arrangement between the two parties with no proper reference the wider electorate .
just as we , as the electorate , need to know on what basis mps get paid expenses and have some influence on how this is done , we should also be involved in the question of how parties are funded .
otherwise , individuals and corporations with large amounts of money are able to buy influence destroying democracy and leading to corruption .
the issue of party funding should be discussed properly out in the open through something like a royal commission .
then proposals should be agreed on by the electorate through a referendum .
the people should decide on these arrangements , not the political parties and their mps .
chris evans , london i have never paid so much interest in politics until this fiasco .
before i trusted mps to make decisions that were in the interest of the people , now i think the majority of mps are putting their own interests first and that think the country owes them something .
i also think this is true of the house of lords with the cash for questions issue , and 2 lords get suspended ... suspended ? ! they should have been fired and stripped of their peerage .
i am looking to vote for a party that wants to change the system , change it so that we the people have a say .
what littl erespect i had for mps and lords , has been lost .
and , i dont think anything the current house does will restore that respect .
richard bennett , abingdon , oxford ballot papers at general elections should have a new box at the bottom which says " none of the above " .
mps should only get a seat if they actually get 51 % or more votes .
whoever you vote for , the government always gets in .
graham southern , brae , shetland it is now time for a major change !
i have already placed e-petitions on the prime minister 's web site - 1 .
for the constitution to be changed so that electorate is able to deselect a government , and 2 .
for the queen to dissolve parliament so that we may have a clean sweep of the current system .
we need serious business input into how the country is governed and not be conned and given pathetic excuses as to every requirement that is requested .
we do not wish to hear " we will look into that " , " we will consider the issue " - we need action - as requested and demanded by the electorate ! !
the government would not be in power if we did not elect them - they should listen to the electorate - or vacate their positions ! ! - got the message ? - well - action ! ! ! !
geoff grubb , united kingdom we have an inferior form of democracy based on representation in parliament , made worthless in recent times as our representatives , represent only themselves .
an unwritten constitution has allowed us to drift towards a form of oligarchy .
-lrb- how else can you explain our involvement in a war without debate -rrb- i would also call on the press to investigate so called ' lobbying ' which in the real world is another name for bribery , and further undermines our ' representative democracy ' .
one further change i would press for is the addition of a box on the ballot where i can record my vote to indicate i do not like the policies of any of the above candidates or their parties .
william russell , consett , co durham i 'm one of few young people -lrb- 19 -rrb- that takes a active interest in politics and how my country is run , and the more i learn about our ' democracy ' through wikipedia and the like , the more disenfranchised i become .
the main reason why voter apathy is so high , and election turnout so low , is that people feel that their voice is n't being heard , and that their vote ca n't make a difference .
with their only participation in the political system being a single vote every 4 years , it 's not at all surprising .
compare that to the swiss system , where a referendum can be called by the people -lrb- a right guaranteed by their constitution -rrb- , on any legislation that their elected representatives want to pass .
most people have a opinion about what parliament are up to , and a system of referendums lets people air their opinions via their vote .
since this mp 's expenses fiasco blew up , i 've seen douglas carswell on tv quite a bit , and found myself agreeing with his every point .
although i wo n't be using my first vote to support his party -lrb- i 'm voting for lib dem for their own reform policies -rrb- , i 've signed up to his blog , will be buying his book , and i really hope he can help to transform our democracy over the next 12 months .
i fear it might be now or never .
nathan massey , leeds , uk yea though our troughs runneth over , we shall fear no ill for the pm is gutless and will do us no harm , yea though we have milked the system rotten the pms self righteousness will overshadow us , and we shall keep our cabinet post all the days of our lives , we shall not discuss our coruptness with the media , but we shall brazen it out and say , we acted within the rules , surely the john lewis list plus expenses will follow us all the days of our parliamentary coruptness , and we shall dwell in the house of splendour forever amen daniel james , stoke on trent staffs although any kind of proportional representation would be an improvement on our present undemocratic method of electing mps , the single transferable vote -lrb- stv -rrb- has a unique advantage , especially suited to the present crisis of confidence in our mps .
it allows voters to choose between candidates of the same and different parties and to rank them according to preference instead of voting for one and against all the others .
that would let voters choose between the very corrupt , the slightly corrupt , the careless and the squeaky clean - to punish the bad and reward the good .
douglas carswell mp 's suggestion of open primaries is very interesting and would be an improvement on present selection methods but , at the end of the day , voters would still have only one candidate from each party and , because most constituencies are safe , the result in most constituencies would still be known in advance .
consequently most voters would continue to waste their votes .
a major advantage of stv is that it combines several open primaries -lrb- one for each party -rrb- with the election itself .
anthony tuffin , selsey , chichester , uk a really good article .
politicians must not believe they are in it for themselves .
in fairness the vast majority seem to want to serve their communities , it is time those people took over the debate and worked hard for change .
they are public servants who represent people " for the greater good " .
the rest are in it for themselves .
people have no respect for that type of person.youngsters do watch the news and do feel they are alienated because the example set is selfish and lacking in sympathy for the plight of ordinary people .
ordinary people feel repressed by a power lobby -lrb- politicians -rrb- who work to keep people " down " - easier to control perhaps ... but at last the people will judge the politicians , , democracy dictates more people should have a say ... ca n't trust those entrusted with the task of looking after the masses. douglas selleck , taplow , south bucks dear mr wheeler ..
the changes that you intimate are absolute imperatives and the very minimum that is required .
westminster as it stands is dead in the water .
if we wish to avoid massive public disobedience and anarchy then massive change has to be brought in .
we will not stand for anything less .
i am a mild mannered person and been politically apathetic but this current scenario has made me wake up to the corruption and the smugness of our so called political leaders .
they have brought this on themselves but for the good of the nation we have to have complete change .
not one of the mp 's cited for ' questionable ' expenses should still be sitting in parliament .
brown / cameron and clegg all knew this was coming .
all mp 's fought for 4 years to deny the publication of their expenses .
they put forward members bills to exmpt themselves from freedom of information legislation .
they all knew this was coming and tried to block it coming out .
not one of them comes out of this with credit .
change now s cosgrove stephen cosgrove , nailsea bristol so they believe they can " drag parliament into the 20th century at least , if not the 21st century " .
i think we can start by bringing it back to the 17th century when guy fawkes tried to blast it back to the stone age ! ... wonder if that 's a policeman at the door ?
ed neal , bristol , united kingdom i agree entirely with the reforms you mention in this article and the need for radical constitutional reform including direct democracy .
clearly our elected representatives in parliament can not be trusted and do not listen to what the electorate have been clamouring for , for years .
they need to understand that they are the servants of the people and not the other way around .
we need to be able to recall mps that do not perform to the satisfaction of the people that elected them .
we need to get rid of the " gentlemen 's club " mentality , bring the politial system into the 21st century and have government of the people , by the people , for the people via direct democracy and proportional representation .
alex alex malcolm , frome , somerst .
uk from now on , all mps must be selected by the voters in their constituencies .
local party organisations may , if they so wish , offer more than one candidate .
but there must be a right enabling anyone offering themselves for selection by their constituents .
let 's end the practice of single candidate choice by moribund local party politicians .
exceptionally for the next general election no existing mps who have made unreasonable financial claims for subsistence shall be allowed to stand for re-election on the grounds thay have cheated their constituents and our country .
john chesterfield , hassocks 1 -rrb- get rid of party politics , every mp is accountable to his constituents , no one else .
2 -rrb- a revue of an mps performance of how well he is doing looking after his constituents interests , a confidence vote every year .
3 -rrb- no expenses at all , a higher salary only .
4 -rrb- no vested interests -lrb- outside companies , lobbies etc ..
if they are paid they are professionals , and due to the very nature and importance of the job they should have no outside interests -rrb- .
5 -rrb- if anyone wants to be an mp , it must be for the right reasons , not for any personal advantage they may get , monitory gain or a waiting consultancy job on retiring from politics .
tony cunningham , epping i do n't understand why there is n't a whole lot more direct democracy in the modern internet powered age .
i think the petition part of the # 10 site could have been a great idea , but they tend to ignore public opinion and replies just suggest the electorate do n't understand the issues , it has n't been explained in enough detail and they are going to go ahead with -lsb- whatever -rsb- reguardless of public opinion .
jon cooper , camborne , cornwall douglas carswell is to be congratulated on his efforts , however if he / we really believe -lrb- s -rrb- the old order will allow substantive changes there is a plane leaving for never never land at the bottom of my garden .
what has appalled me most of all is the temporary allowances solution .
we will note that they have retained the second homes allowance ! that does not take away the incentive for mps to make a profit using the taxpayers back .
second homes should be limited to rented accommodation only , then i will believe .
phil , preston full democracy we have reached the stage now where disillusionment and apathy regarding politics and politicians seriously undermines any claim to a fully democratic form of governance in the uk . , where everyone feels involved and is a participant .
as i started to read about the brave new world of communication called the internet in the mid- 90 's and then went online in 1999 , i soon realised the enormous potential for transforming the democratic and political landscape .
the problem with political ideologies , is that they are a form of intellectual straitjacket .
there are boundaries .
if you are a socialist you have to think within socialist boundaries .
if you are a capitalist you are confined within those boundaries .
yet , i often find myself agreeing with a little bit of this socialist thinking and a bit of that capitalist philosophy .
these idealogical prisons restrict and inhibit our free and unrestricted thought processes .
the internet provides the framework for a genuinely democratic and inclusive form of government , local and national , truly proportional representation .
the various political parties would continue to exist and to espouse their own policies , locally within town , district and county councils and , nationally , in london , cardiff and edinburgh .
every policy , plan , proposal , would be put up on the internet , which would be accessible in public places , such as town halls , libraries , as well as at home of course. they would be advertised locally and nationally , in the press , radio and tv .
the electorate would simply look through the menus and vote for the items they are concerned about .
the role of mps / councillors would change to that of promoter of their own parties or councils proposals .
they would still go out and canvass , to publicise each proposal .
there would be broadcasts and advertising to this effect .
the representatives , as mp 's would become , would only be voting for themselves not on behalf of anyone else .
this eliminates the tendency of mp 's to vote against the wishes of the majority of their constituents ..
it also eliminates the frequent government habit of creating a manifesto to win votes and , after they are elected , quietly dropping those pledges which are ' inconvenient ' .
it also wipes out ego-maniacs and control freaks at a stroke .
when voters realise they really do have a genuine say , participation and involvement will greatly increase .
thus , instead of rigid ideologies gaining a stranglehold , the electorate actually get what a majority want .
this would end the ridiculous see-saw situation , whereby the two chief political ideologies continually undo what the other has done , causing instability nationally .
nationalise / privatise / renationalise / reprivatise , and so on .
by this system , no party or colour of council ever has total control of anything . unless the public vote for all of one parties proposals over the others , which is unlikely .
anyway , with new policies or proposals being put up for a vote on a continuous basis , such a situation would n't last long anyway .
if people believe in a pure , genuine form of democracy and , i 'm not entirely convinced that most do then , this is about as close as it will ever be .
steve diamond , dorset i think this scandal 'll blow over and things will carry on much as before , quite simply because those in positions of power wo n't want to give up what they 've got and those who hope to get in will want all that power when they are in .
it 's amazing when you watch yes prime minister that that was 20 years ago and yet it could talking about now .
tim venables , asuncion , paraguay i now have a discomfort and that relates to the quality of media activity .
i see a huge amount of speculation , especially from the unelected publicly funded bbc , supported by precious little fact .
it is important that you give an account of the facts and try to curtail your own opinions .
whilst it is important for journalists to provide a judgement on the facts , i feel that you are going well beyond that which can be corroborated .
of your 7 bullet points i would like to know which you honestly can identify as information based on fact and from any statistically significant proportion of the political establishment and which are tittle-tattle based on your prejudices .
john davie , redbourn , herts almost everybody nowadays is involved in some kind of scam , financial services , nhs staff , social services , and now mps .
why get hysterical about mps and use it to further totalitarianise british society by ' reforming ' parliament and finally destroying the british democratic tradition .
ian ian dunbar , maidstone while reform , and particularly clearer and better voting systems , are desperately needed , an elected lords is the last thing we need .
elected politicians only ever take the short-term view , when what the uk really needs is for at least part of its political establishment to take a long term view .
we need more appointed peers , a return to hereditary peers , and more power given back to the monarchy .
only then will we be able to truly tackle the challenges of the coming years .
jack howard , leeds , uk there are a number of reforms that i think are worthwhile , but i hope that the current environment will not allow the fringe to take a hold .
proportional representation is a bad idea , leading to unstable government , which is completely ineffective -lrb- e.g. : italy -rrb- and also has the potential to dilute democratic representation -lrb- in south africa , there is no mp ... so who do you hold to account for constituency issues -rrb- .
i hope that the drive to modernise does n't mean losing our wits along the way .
and besides , i think many of the historical conventions and traditions of parliament are worthwhile reminders of where we come from .
if we are to have elected lords , then the party system will simply swallow it up and both houses will be lackeys of government .
hereditary peers may not be a ' fair ' way to do it , but it 's the randomness of it that provides protection to the political system .
if the hereditary peers are to be removed , i wonder if there will be an effective random method to keep the lords out of the hands of the party in government .
michael ansley , aldershot , uk i like the sound of mr carswell 's ideas .
our mp 's may yet become ' in touch ' with real people .
george , woking while reform is undoubtedly a good thing ; the current system allows the voter little real say in some of the major decisions made that affect all of us , there seem to me to be two issues with the suggestions that seem to be being floated .
firstly , a change to an " american system " , with a written constitution ... the american system is notoriously corrupt , with lobbying groups wielding massive amounts of power , and what is a constitution other than pretty words ?
secondly the changes being proposed appear to be completely cosmetic , how would changing the way in which we vote make any real difference ?
that isnt the issue , but the way that decisions are made .
we need more advisory commitees who are actually listened to , and referendums on important issues , not surface reforms devoid of any real clout .
emma seymour , london a resounding yes to all seven bullet points identifying desirable change .
our inadeqaute and farcical system is overburdened by symbolism and tradition .
i see little evidence of genuine democracy in action .
many people do not bother to vote any more because whichever of the two main parties wins , nothing really changes .
our politicians make the mistake of thinking it is apathy that keeps election turnouts low .
it 's not ... it 's anger and frustration .
no candidate will get my vote unless reform of parliament and government is top of the list on the manifesto .
nothing else is of interest to me .
andy myers , goxhill , north lincs i am in favour of some system similar to proportional representation as long as the system resolves problems such as no-clear-majority elections .
the problem of coalition governments is one thing since it leads to horse-trading and watering down of ideas .
but an even biger problem is that this system leads to the same representatives being put into public office since they are allocated by party leaders .
that is a total job-for-life scenario and therefore the opposite of what we were trying to achieve .
because of course it inevitably leads to corruption .
for example , i understand that in belgium the transport minister has been in the job for a very long time .
the story goes that he has a brother who owns a business making street lights and guess what ...
belgium is the only country in the world to have every inch of it 's motorways lit by street lights .
be careful what you wish for - proportional representation of parties is a bad thing if it means that the actual mps are chosen by a political elite .
give labour 100 mps , for example , and guess who we get ...
hazel blears , jacqui smith , gordon brown .
basically , all the people that we probably think should be ejected from the political system , we have no way to do that even if we call an election .
does n't work , does it ?
the current system , for all it 's failings does at least ensure that a section of the voters can ensure that these people are removed from power .
in essence - simply opting for proportional representation is not enough .
we need to consider the objectives and then devise a system that achieves them .
and for once , also consider which problems we are trying to prevent / avoid - government are historically really , really bad at seeing how things will be abused / misused .
because in any walk of life there are always people who will do that if they can - even " honourable " members .
by the way - has the issue of mps second jobs gone into hiding ?
my view : if you 're an mp you should do that and only that .
tipping the wink to a company on economic policy as a paid director or consultant is effectively insider trading and should be criminal in my view .
chris , uk we have a scottish parliament , welsh assembly , and storemont so why not therefore turn parliament -lrb- commons -rrb- into the english parliament / assembly to deal with english matters and the house of lords into the uk -lrb- elected -rrb- parliament to deal with uk national interests -lrb- defence , foreign policy and whatever else is left over from the eu -rrb- .
david huxtable , cirencester glos for a long time i have suspected that mps are not to be trusted and mostly " in it for themselves " .
now i know that they definitely are .
parliament needs to be dissolved , power temporarily handed over to the monarchy and a public committee set up , to investigate all of the wrong doings in parliament and put in place a system that will , mostly , prevent wrong doings again .
democracy is an illusion and that illusion has been cracked .
the only way forward now is to completely reform the system and replace the present bunch of misguided mps .
if that means all of the mps must be replaced , then so be it .
none of them can ever be trusted again .
gary bushe , bristol , uk my hope is that there are enough ' good ' mps to bring about the change needed .
the electorate is helpless , we can only vote for those that we believe can bring about change ! what they do when they get there is up to them , remember that they alone have the vote to change the law .
we can only hope that there are enough with the guts to do what is right .
my fear is that the present scandal will subside and we will end up with a little tinkering and much of the same .
martin wilson , maidstone , kent never proportional representation , under no circumstances should we inflict this mess on ourselves !
the libdems want it because it would hand power to them -lrb- 20-25 % of the vote -rrb- , this is worse than the current system .
michael pearce , bracknell it 's the share holder who has the ultimate responsibility for bringing about change , in this case the electorate. unfortunately approximately every 5 years we elect on mamifesto and pack up and go home .
the apathy of mass majority governance is now apparent , in the appalling squandering of our financial resources by people ill prepared on how to use them , but each minster was given an enormous lottery win to go and spend as and how , no experience needed , a prime minister and his chancellor who presided over deregulization of the banking division , and spent every penny that we had on the get rich quick brigade .
mr carswell may not be everybodies idea of a prime minister but at least he 's got the voters interests at heart , so that 's a start in the right direction .
go to my man , and never mind the flak .
keith wilmore , goole e yorks with the present economic climate as it is then the house of lords should be reduced to 250 abled bodied persons. the house of commons reduced to about 300 , i.e. one mp per shire district .
reduce the number of meps to nil.come out of the common market and deal with commonwealth countries , and finally do away with councillors who have no place in a modern society.local government officers are well paid , and make all local decisions so why pay councillors , their meal and travelling expenses together with the cost of committees , and annual election expenses .
terry billingham , west midlands , england .
please , are the mass of the people ever going to wake up and see what is going on in this world ?
this scam is played out time and time again and the public just lap it up and fall for it every time .
those who really run this world have been steering us towards a world dictatorship for over 70 years .
people have been manipulated for years via the media -lrb- owned by the very people mentioned above -rrb- to believe that parliament is corrupt and that politicians are the lowest of the low .
it 's just another stepping stone , another seed sown in the public mind .
maybe you deserve what 's coming .
barry , all these reforms need to take place to restore representative democracy to westminster .
proportional representation within groupings of several constituences together would ensure there is representation whilst ensuring votes are n't wasted like under first past the post .
we need fixed parliament terms to guarantee that general elections are n't suggested and then denied .
we need a clear , codified , constitution that can been relied on and legally enforced to protect democracy and guard against excesses of the state and the executive .
we need a constitution that addears to the principles of the seperation of powers of the excutive , legislative and judicary .
we need entrenchment of demcracy , otherwise under an uncodified system we see the continuing expansion of the power of the executive and the clamp down on debate and accountbility of the government .
absolute power leads to corruption .
the power of the party whips stiffles the ability of the individual mp to represent their constituents and the power should be curbed .
the uk 's twin pillars of parliamentary supremacy and the rule of law alone are insufficient to carry the state into the 20th century , let alone the 21st .
although we elect individual mp 's , we have no say over who will run the country and will represent us .
although the prime minister is only the head of government the pm holds many powers of a head of state .
where as in other countries the head of state is elected such as in the usa , republic of ireland , france , germany , etc .
our head of state -lrb- the queen -rrb- reigns but does not rule .
if the monarchy is retained , we still require an actual head of state who is elected .
that i why i think we should have a system of government with the honoury head of state -lrb- the monarch -rrb- -lrb- non elected -rrb- , the real head of state -lrb- president / premier -rrb- -lrb- elected -rrb- who sits outside of parliament and has excutive powers , has advisors for the equivalent of cabinet .
the head of government -lrb- prime minister -rrb- sits with the legisaltive in parliament .
the house of lords should be replaced with 2 bodies the senate and the supreme court .
the senate contains senators that are elected representatives that review legislation passed by the lower house and approve , vote down legislation according to the constitution .
the supreme court would take over the house of lords other role of being the supreme court of appeal of the judicial system .
we need a federalist democratic constitution akin to the usa , france or germany .
during the so called war on terror we have also seen the erosion of unprotected civil liberties that should of been protected .
much of the counter terrorism legislation that has been passed has not protected us from attack but has instead been mis-used and has only eroded our freedoms .
any one who is willing to trade a little liberty for a little security , deserves neither and will lose both .
stephen goldthorp , plymouth uk the time has come for britain to have a written constitution .
it makes no sense that scotland , wales and northern ireland have their own assemblies but england does not .
indeed it is apparent to all english voters that they are being unfairly penalised for living in england .
the scots enjoy ' perks ' like free residential care for the elderly and the abolition of tuition fees for university students while people in england do not .
westminster should be reformed by : a .
abolishing the house of lords b. having an english assembly along the lines of the scottish parliament c .
having a much ' slimmed down ' house of commons -lrb- ie a uk parliament of representatives of england , scotland , wales and northern ireland -rrb- to pass laws on national issues like taxation , defence and foreign policy .
martin limon , beverley , east yorkshire yes - let 's have a constitutional convention where everything is on the table .
one observation - the last big constitutional issue : the west lothian question .
not even a mention !
not big enough any more ?
wow - we really are in interesting times !
hany mustapha , kingston upon thames , surrey i find it criminal that you are floating all these wonderful ideas past me , wetting my dulled apatite .
i would go further and abolish party politics and also making mp selection like jury duty .
i am a great believer that the person who wants to be an mp should be the last person on this earth to do so .
but then on the other hand , without career politicians , who would keep the civil service in check ?
if most politicians are utterly morally bankrupt and corrupt after 15 years , what of career civil servants ?
as it stands the only thing that would get me to vote for my local mp , is to choose if they are shot , electrocuted , lethal injection or hung , drawn and quartered .
paul o 'donnell , liverpool , uk i think the revolution will take the form of lab / con / lib parties losing swathes of seats to the minor parties - and deservedly so !
too long have they sat in their ivory towers ignoring the public and failing to address the major issues facing this country and it 's future ...
alex , edgware it 's the share holder who has the ultimate responsibility for bringing about change , in this case the electorate. unfortunately approximately every 5 years we elect on mamifesto and pack up and go home .
the apathy of mass majority governance is now apparent , in the appalling squandering of our financial resources by people ill prepared on how to use them , but each minster was given an enormous lottery win to go and spend as and how , no experience needed , a prime minister and his chancellor who presided over deregulization of the banking division , and spent every penny that we had on the get rich quick brigade .
mr carswell may not be everybodies idea of a prime minister but at least he 's got the voters interests at heart , so that 's a start in the right direction .
go to my man , and never mind the flak .
keith wilmore , goole e yorks there is no stomach for change .
you only have to listen to gordon brown or his cronies saying they will get rid of anyone who has broken the rules .
you have at least 6 cabinet memebers still in work and will be as long as this goverment sits .
the only difference now is the sleeping brits have been awoken and hitler found out what than can mean frank rodgers , oxford the mother of parliaments was only a model for the world when the people could rely on the honour of its members to make it work .
it must be time for a new model from the new world - a directly elected pm with independent scrutiny from smaller and more representative houses .
ray martin , wrexham i hope that the anger and frustration felt by so many people over the way this country is run - not so much by the current party in power - but by the " system " , which is so corrupt and out of date as to be a sick joke , that peole will continue to be active in forcing long needed change .
if britain claims to be modern then its governing system needs to be modern too .
by all means keep traditions which are meaningful and useful , but not the ones that support the archaic and corrupt system we have to date .
having lived in germany for 30 odd years until 5 years ago , i have now developed an affliction since my return .
it is called : " shaking one 's head in disbelief and frustration " at what happens ... or does n't happen but should ... several times a day .
so until further notice and until things are sorted out .
lets call ourselves " little britain - that banana republic in northern europe " .
michael skinley , plymouth , england if we could vote for the person and not the party , a better and more worthy mp would emerge .
if parliament was not run on " party " lines but by mp 's who voted for their constituents and passed laws according to their conscience that would be democratic , to use a much misused word ! !
des adams , redditch , worcestershire once in power , self serving mps forget that they are our servants and not our masters .
why should our archaic political system be held to be a wonderful example of democracy when it is so far removed from the public it serves .
terry glinwood , guildford it 's about time !
but it all sounds like tinkering to me .
the executive would still not be directly elected by the people .
why not go the whole hog and separate it from parliament ?
if proportional representation comes in , as it should , it will be increasingly hard to " form a government " ; and the exec would potentially be paralysed by a hung parliament .
for proportional representation to be workable , it will need to happen .
rob , edinburgh mp 's cosy club is an outrage in this day and age , it harks back to when the general public were unaware of their actions and perks .
now the bubble has burst , we do know the truth , now we want change .
the club needs to be closed , those guilty of milking the system should be dismissed , those that are dismissed should do so with no pension rights , they should not be financially rewarded for their greed and corrupt behaviour. trevor elson , london we hear little about the people who advised mps about their claims and sanctioned the drive to claim as much as possible .
several exposed mps have said they asked about their claims and even avoiding paying capital gains tax and were given the go-ahead .
these are at the root of the problems and most culpable .
the mps themselves should expose their advisers and see them punished !
behind the elected are the sir humphreys who specialise in lining their pockets and undermining all attempts at reform .
who will control them ! ! ! !
margaret craske , west runton , cromer north norfolk .
it goes much deeper than the collective feeding frenzy and snouts in the trough .
swine flu may be on the way but swine fever has been rife in parliament for some time .
please explain how mps can also hold down token , but well-paid , directorships or advisory roles as well as their " full time " jobs in parliament .
the whole system needs to be reformed and lawbreakers punished by the full weight of the judiciary .
terry bennion , blaby england do it !
all those things about reform people have been talking about for so long.i am a briton long resident in australia , but my country has always been britain , never australia , regardless of my domicle.i want my country to hold its head high once again and be respected around the world , especially in australia.regardless of what the british high commissioner has said from time to time about anglo-australian relations being so good , that is a nonsense.amongst the ordinary people the british are a joke and are generally despised.they do not like to see britain as a successful country in sport or in any other thing.reform and show them how it should be done.they are thoroughly enjoying british discomfort in this deeply distasteful episode in our political life .
brian napthine , brisbane , queensland , australia .
surely it is now time for reform .
apart from recent scandals , politicians whether local or national have milked the system , although there are many genuine people .
the farce which is called prome minister questions -lrb- wednesday 's -rrb- raises very few questions from mp 's that have not been prompted from the main parties leaderships .
the battle between the prime minister and the leaders of the opposition is simply bear pit , very few questions are answered , usually all parties leaders throw about statistics likened to a nuclear arsenal. this % stated by one , declared wrong by another .
what is the truth behind politics noneone knows .
soon we shall endure an election to europe and soon after a general election .
we did this , no , that was our idea , we all know the lies and inuendoes that will be thrown about .
how many people will bother to vote ! ! !
i guess the first elections will be less that 40 % , the next general election will be lucky to achieve 50 % .
the winning party whoever it is and by whatever the majority will be lucky to achieve 40 % of the vote .
those elected in the past on such figures -lrb- although politicians will come up with all sorts of guestimates -rrb- will have thier finger in the pie .
apathy ! ! ! ! of course .
i am taxed on virtually everything by people who have got of scot free , i thought law was law for all the population , no not as far as the lected ones go .
got that off my chest , now to tear up my voting card , or shall i just put it in the tin box and write " rubbish " on it ? .
malcolm j haynes , lt paxton st neots cambridgeshire pe19 6qb uk why is everybody so much more upset about the politicians misappropriating thousands , when the bankers have cost us billions here in the uk and trillions in the usa ?
come on everyone , get some perspective .
the politicians deserve to be in the sin bin but do n't let this furore distract attention away from the real story of the criminal bankers whose malfeasance will be affecting us , our children and our grandchildren long after any serving politician or civil servant has gone .
people , wake up .
matt , london i agree with david starkey .
it is time for a directly elected prime minister , a lower house of about 400 , a fully-elected upper house , proportional representation , and candidate selection by primaries .
this would shift power from party machines to the people and separate the executive from parliament .
john mooney , clydebank , scotland how about devolving most of the common 's power to local government ?
england -lrb- and other parts of the uk if they wanted -rrb- could then run a federal system that would bring decision-making closer to the subjects .
-lrb- and if we ditch the monarchy , we can actually be citizens rather than subjects -rrb- .
simon linskill , sheffield now is the time for us all to make our views known , and to do something about it - i have started a group -lrb- not a party - yet -rrb- to reform the uk - the web site is at ukreform.net - and i was startled to see that the electoral reforms that you set out at the start of your article are at the heart of what uk reform is all about .
let 's get off our backsides and change the system , so that this mess does n't happen again !
robert mccaffrey , epsom , surrey the only people to blame are the great british public , election after election you here the same old comments , my granddad voted labour , and my dad , so i will as well , or they have been in long enough , so i will vote for the other lot , the british are just a load of lemmings ready to jump over the cliff together , we are controlled from the most corrupt place on earth , brussels , time to wave goodbye to them for a start , vote ukip. john balme , blakeney , glos .
typically only one third of registered voters use their right to vote .
whether it 's due to apathy caused by all politicians being perceived as self-seeking freeloaders , or frustration with the first-past-the-post voting system , surely it makes democratic sense to get the votes from all voters .
so , another item that must be included in the much-needed reform of british politics is mandatory voting .
david , cheshire forget about the expenses for the minute .
our economy is pretty screwed .
this is not helped by throwing huge loads of money at europe , who in turn dictate us with another layer of unnecessary totalitarian waste .
we ca n't afford the eu , a massive public sector , loads more red tape that adding further viscosity to the economy .
this method is damaging the very productivity that pays for the whole system .
the " third way " -lrb- social democracy -rrb- as championed by blair and clinton is n't working .
it does n't work as it combines big government with a pseudo-redistribution of wealth that makes it difficult to achieve for those with gusto , also letting the lazy feel comfortable in their seats .
it is common knowledge that people with power often start off altruistic but their basic human fallibilities , ie greed , let them down .
since we pay for all of them and all of this .
would n't it be better to have less silly little laws , less things to enforce , a bit of responsibility and a fewer people continually kicking us along .
the country does not need this level of government and no party seems to offer this as a solution .
the conservative party is not conservative , ie classic liberalism , the liberals are in fact social democrats and labour are by definition the same .
3 varieties of a flawed concept which is too big , dictates and coerces too much and is killing , rather than fostering this country as a happy , prospering nation to be proud of. stuart dann , se cornwall of course proportional representation is absolutely essential in any reforms .
but it must be the single transferable vote syetem , which busts the power of party machines , not a list system , which strengthens it. richard , nottingham it is good to read comments which approve or at least seriously consider citizen-led direct democracy -lrb- dd -rrb- .
most people take this to mean partial dd - we do n't want to get rid of parties and parliaments , we just improve the system by starting to use democratic tools such as the optional veto-referendum and the citizens ' law proposal -lrb- " initiative " -rrb- .
to get real reform will need an active movement , perhaps more like the campaign for real ale than the chartists . ; - -rrb- it will take some years to achieve success so if you want to keep in touch - and maybe help out - an educational and advocacy campaign , then please peruse and sign up at i & r ~ gb citizens ' initiative and referendum campaign for direct democracy in britain http : / / www.iniref.org / michael macpherson , guildford , ex co .
durham severe danger of babies and bathwater here .
when there is a general mood of dissatisfaction around , the word " change " is appealing and people rush to oil the tumbrils .
our strongest tool in dealing with the current swinishness at westminster is the unwritten constitution , in that it can evolve with requirements and does not require great upheavals so to do .
as for this display of soiled undergarments in the commons , by what form of logic does this have anything to do with direct election of the upper house ?
the grasping mendacity has come from our elected representatives - moreover , the last thing that we need is yet another layer of elections .
the upper house , in its present form , has been more effective at applying checks and balances to the more doctrinaire thrusts of the commons than any other body .
as we quietly get rid of the bufton-tuftons , the lords has become a huge repository of expertise - far greater than the commons , which is commanded by people who have never been anything other than political weasels all their days .
it makes no sense to throw out all that experience and knowledge every few years .
n macdonald , perth , scotland what is probably not realised by all is that this ongoing scandal has made headline , mainstream news broadcasts all over europe .
how do you think the europeans now feel about british posturing on corruption in europe institutions - the word hypocrisy sums it up .
roderick mcleod , ostrava , czech rep. oh purlease : do n't hold up the american system as an example to us !
heaven forbid that we should be subjected to that political circus show .
let us not forget that that system resulted in the election of the bush administration , which then proceeded to ride roughshod over human rights worldwide .
yes we need reform .
we must have elected representatives who fear their electorate more than their party .
they must be adequately remunerated - including compensation for the fact that they will be living away from home for much of the time .
however it must be straightforward and transparent .
that 's all .
mike evans , tonbridge , kent tradition , ritual , history and the ' island mentality ' are at the core of the political turmoil we are now witnessing in the uk .
on this little island we have a rich and long history , however , history is past tense and as long as we remain in the past , we will never move forward .
as well as all the ideas put forward above , perhaps it is time to build a new , modern parliament building and let the present location become a tourist attraction which will make money , not waste money .
a new home for the british parliament , new younger experienced mp 's and a new transparent rule book with which to govern this once proud country .
perhaps guidance should be sought from the swedish democratic system perhaps that is the kick up the rear that this country now needs. ian wickison , peterborough please do n't forget that the privy council and its " orders in council " needs to be severely reformed- throwing the inhabitants of diego garcia out of their country at the behest of the americans is just one of hundreds of examples of archaic empire-style removal of human rights !
peter gregory , london and kuala lumpur douglas carswell has brought to the attention of all the mps the need for change in our political system and the corrupt expenses fiasco since 2005 .
they all knew what was going on but only a handful were brave enough to try and fight the system , therefore none of the spineless mps who have done nothing to back mr carswells reforms over the past 4 years should be trusted , if we do trust them they will just resort back to the old ways as soon as the dust settles .
maybe mr carswell should be prime minister and the 24 colleagues who have backed him since 2005 should make up his cabinet , this way we would get the change in this country that is desperately needed .
colin , inverness while it is glaring obvious that serious and far reaching changes need to be made , the only people who can make them are the law makers , the members of parliment .
are there enough in the hoc to bring about those changes ?
do the turkeys vote for christmas ?
john lucas , crich , matlock here 's an idea .
give all the mps a decent raise to bring them in line with other professionals , but at the same time completely scrap all allowances .
add in the fixed term for office and a legal requirement to vote and we 'll see a renewed and vigorous parliament .
our system * is * broken , but it 's not * that * broken .
stephen , hornsea i agree with the content of this article ... the death of this ancient pantomime that is the houses of parliament and all the paraphenalia that goes with it is long overdue .
britain can never hope to compete in a modern world with a political system that is centuries old and which the majority of the population just can not associate with .
you only need to look at the voting percentages to realise that this ' old boys club ' should be disbanded .
it is certainly time to completely reform our political system with proportional representation and complete tranparency of the activities of our elected representatives .
clear out the old westminter processes and procedures and have a modern written constitution that really does give control to the people .
i suggest that the nation should abstain from the up and coming european election to give a very clear message to parliament that they have lost the confidence of the people and that they must initiate change now .
dave stewart , edinburgh why is anyone surprised that politicians are self-serving criminals , they 've been like that for centuries !
make voting compulsory to stop the apathy of ' what 's the point ' .
but include on the ballot form the option of ' none of the above ' , so that if you choose not to go to the poll , your vote will automatically be cast for ' none of the above ' .
drop the ' member of ' -lrb- the exclusive club -rrb- title so that those elected get back to becoming our parliamentary representatives .
drop the ' right honourable ' title since it 's patently clear that none of them actually are !
parliamentary representatives must have lived in the constituency for at least 7 years to stop the political career wannabes .
so should we scrap the existing politicians ? , hell no .
as an entertainment channel they would be a constant source of . -lrb- fill in your own blanks -rrb- .
michael ross , leeds , england while a part of me would be sad to see hundreds of years of tradition blown away , our current mps have shown just quite how open to abuse our system is .
a system that has managed for centuries relying on the honourable conduct of mps has been shown to be wholly inappropriate for the current rake of members .
a written constitution would at least protect the civil rights constantly being eroded by a government who seems to view protest and action that threastens their position as the only crime worth stamping down on .
a great shame but a necessary change .
sam , london , uk there are several of the suggested changes that make no sense .
1 .
if the second chamber is elected , then how is it different from the first .
if it is the same then what is the point ? .
2 .
if we have less mp 's then that will mean larger constituencies.how will the public know which is the best person for the job , especially if they were not linked to a party platform .
3 .
if we follow the primary route suggested as in the us , then the candidates would need to raise their own campaign funding .
consequently , they would need deeper pockets or to know those with deeper .
the only other outcome would would be more celebrity candidates .
imo we can not eliminate mp 's acting in their own interests entirely , i just wish they would spend as much effort doing there jobs .
the point is that mp 's have always had vested interests right back to the days that they were all landed gentry .
a lot of people get annoyed that mp 's do not spend every waking hour of the day dedicated to their " vocation " , i suspect that most of their constituents also spend some time thinking of their own / their famililies best interests .
the mp 's are getting a " fair " days pay , lets see a fair day 's work .
david bennett , swindon england i agree that reform is due , but am concerned about turning the lords into another commons by election of peers -lrb- or their new equivalent ? -rrb- .
the lords was always a balance for the commons , and with just the recent minor reduction of the power of the lords 1000s of these petty-fogging nanny state laws have not been blocked at the lords - the government can do whatever it likes .
elections vote in those people -lrb- parties -rrb- that are in favour at the time .
if the electorate is the same for both houses then the same types of people will populate both houses - they become the same in all but name .
politians have already shown that they can not self-regulate , so different processes are required to populate each house .
both houses are required - each to balance the other .
sue , newcastle upon tyne reforming the uk 's government is something that should be a non-party issue , it has had such broad support - for over a hundred years !
the problem is with those in party politics who do not want to dismantle any part of the political system that they imagine is of advantage them .
for example people have been trying to introduce stv into britain since the 1880 's , and it was actually introduced into ireland as part of the uk in 1919 .
there was also actually a bill to reform the electoral system of the uk using av in 1930 , and ofcourse variations of this have been used here in wales and scotland - but i suspect this has only been done to in ways to protect party power not to empower the electorate with choices .
in any case we need to remember that democracy is not about voting - the word " democracy " implies that people have power , and all systems of representative democracy need ways to hold their representatives to account aswell as ways to elect suitable candidates .
there is ! a heap of issues to be considered in reforming the uk , not least of which is how our representatives are so incompetant rather than corrupt - we have people flipping burgers who are better qualified to do their jobs than those entrusted with nuclear weapons .
at the bottom of many of these issues is the party system not any particular electoral system , any of which such parties may successfully manipulate .
dai - david b lawrence , cardiff now we have promises that mps will put all their expenses on line .
is their no way we can demand the same from our european candidates in the forthcoming june elections !
see if we can start the ball rolling in brussels .
andy pyke , crowthorne berkshire a fully elected chamber to reduce patronage ?
half of us ca n't be bothered to vote for a parliament in which patronage is rife and expense-fiddling endemic .
what would change with a second one ? all parties know that when someone goes to the lords , they lose pretty much all leverage over them. the offer of the lords works in the commons .
once given , it is pretty much gone .
why not change the lords to the english parliament and then have the regional assemblies / parliaments suggest legislation to the commons to assess ?
it wo n't change the party system , but it might rationalise things .
john brown , london , uk the writing is very clearly on the wall for party whips - totally outdated office .
tom norton , eccleshall now that we have a welsh and scottish assembly , i would like to see an english assembly replacing the existing house of commons and an elected senate for the uk replacing the house of lords .
bengy carery-evans , pentrefelin all this talk of reform has reminded me of a wonderful quote by g k chesterton .
' the whole modern world has divided itself into conservatives and progressives .
the business of progressives is to go on making mistakes .
the business of the conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected . '
cynical maybe but i ca n't help thinking also quite apt .
andy , bristol proportional representation would be a disaster , ensuring that the liberal democrats would permanently be in government as they would always be holding the balance of power .
this would be fundementally undemocratic as the lib dems have always got far fewer votes that labour or the conservatives .
the first-past-the-post system must be retained if we want to remain a real democracy .
guy , guy @ newsfile.net bloody politicians .
very few of them are worth voting for .
even if the are they are part of a machine with a different agenda .
they stop the real people voting by not making it accessible .
and those who do vote are n't given the real information needed to decide who should run the country .
why ca n't you or i stand up and say ' we can do better .
because we are supressed by the elite who assume control .
revolution is the only way .
ben , tavistock would it not be better if ministers were required to be qualified and experienced in their area of responsibility ?
foe example , the minister for health to be an experienced and eminent physician , and the minister associated with defra to be qualified in agriculture and / or veterinary science .
this might obviate some of the ignorance and incompetence , which has been so prevalent .
jeff williams , market harborough , uk most of the so-called radical reforms being banded around are nothing more than common sense when you come down to it .
proportional representation - works if we do it on a regional -lrb- county -rrb- basis , so preserving an element of local representation but also rewarding true support from the votors .
any supposedly " hung " parliament would force mps and leaderships to co-operate -lrb- never a bad thing , surely -rrb- .
as for the thoroughly debased expenses system - the issues seem to centre around " second homes " as mps need to have a base in london while they 're in parliament - so why not create a " parliament campus " when everyone can stay in some sort of " mps ' village " while present in the commons .
no second home , no rampant expenses .
do n't even get me started on the house of lords ...
stephen barker , yorkshire i can not be alone in feeling disenfranchised and frustrated as an individual voter and completely outside the current political process .
i hope that whatever comes out of the present upheavals , that we can at last have changes which re-engage citizens in decision making .
we need a process in which we can be involved , if we want to be , more than once every 4-5 years by marking a ballot paper .
