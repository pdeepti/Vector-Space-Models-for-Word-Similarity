the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an open letter , the parents of the 17 year old youth who went on a shooting spree that shocked germany last week , express their sorrow .
tim k. , who shot dead 15 in the attack , had been treated for depression . the parents of tim k. , the 17 year old who killed 15 people before turning his father 's pistol on himself in a police shootout that shocked germany last wednesday , have spoken out in public for the first time . in an open letter addressed to the victims , the parents and sister said they had never imagined that tim could be capable of gunning down 12 pupils and teachers at his former school .
he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .
" we keep asking ourselves over and over again how this could happen ?
why did n't we notice his despair and hatred ? " they said in the letter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family home near stuttgart in southwest germany .
" we were a completely normal family " " until this terrible event we were a completely normal family , " they wrote .
" we never thought tim capable of something like this and knew him as a different person . "
the parents had apparently not known that their son was being treated for depression as an outpatient at a psychiatric clinic in the small southwestern town of winnenden , where the fatal school shooting took place .
through their lawyer , who spoke to the german magazine focus over the weekend , they denied he had received any treatment whatsoever .
prosecutors investigating the case argue that tim k. 's depression was a ground for relieving him from germany 's compulsory military service .
they said he had started treatment at the winnenden clinic , but did not follow through with it .
father being investigated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beretta pistol used in the attack had not been locked away .
the family statement was released on tuesday , a day after prosecutors said they were investigating tim 's father on involuntary manslaughter charges for failing to keep the beretta pistol used in the attack safely locked away .
a member of a gun club , tim k. 's father had an arsenal of 15 firearms .
fourteen of them were locked up in accordance to the german law , but prosecutors say the 9 mm .
beretta was not .
" the most valuable and important thing , a beloved person , was taken from you by the horrible and incompressible act of our son and brother , " the letter said .
" we are shocked and stand crying and silent before this incomprehensible tragedy .
we want to express our deepest sympathy to the victims , family and friends .
all of our thoughts are with those afflicted in body and spirit , " the letter continued .
prosecutors in stuttgart have also released the preliminary results of an autopsy which confirmed that tim died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a shootout with the police .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .

in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .

a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .

" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 18.03.2009 bald tattoo artist to sell head space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : missed opportunity : he should 've considered tanriverdi 's plan a german tattoo artist who offered his bald head as advertising space thought he 'd found the perfect way to raise some cash .
but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .
the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .
the rest of tanriverdi 's body is already decorated with over 30 tattoos , including a massive spider 's web spreading over his neck . but what kind of client is he hoping to attract ? " i do n't mind what they want to put on there , as long as it 's in earnest , " he said .
up to now , the most interest has come from internet shops and - not surprisingly - tattoo companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lasering off a tattoo is not easy or painless customers looking for a bargain may want to take advantage of the price scale tanriverdi has cleverly worked out .
for 500 euros , he 'll wear a tattoo on his head for a year .
starting from 4,000 euros , his scalp can be yours for three years .
and anyone willing to spring for 18,000 euros or more can own the space until the end of tanriverdi 's life . but a dermatologist at the university hospital in muenster has thrown a wrench in the works , warning that tattooing one 's head with the intention of removing the artwork by laser and tattooing anew is not only painful , it 's stupid . " it 's not like using an eraser , " nadine peukert told german news agency dpa .
" afterwards , the skin will look different , and on the scalp , this could easily lead to scarring . " dc / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?

allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?
the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending . " in the context of the euro area , guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity , " said trichet . he defended the approach against criticisms that euro interest rates are still too high by noting that the 16 euro-zone countries , which share the european currency , and the united states have " significantly different financial structures . " the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year . " us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke had also said in earlier television interview on sunday that the us could start see " green shoots " of recovery next year . the crisis has triggered the worst recession in decades for germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy and world 's leading exporter , but the outlook could brighten due to a rise in investor confidence , according to experts . " the bottom of the recession is likely to be reached this summer , " wolfgang franz , head of the zew institute , which compiling the confidence index , told the afp news agency . df / sms / afp / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .

" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .

" the top priority is the putting in place of a new global financial architecture , " the two leaders wrote in their joint letter to the czech eu presidency on tuesday , march 17 .
merkel and sarkozy said the eu should propose the registration , regulation and supervision of all hedge funds and other private investment firms that could pose a systematic risk .
leaders attending the april 2 g20 summit are to debate reforms to the international financial system in light of the global economic crisis .
no new measures the joint letter was the latest signal to washington that france and germany oppose pushing new stimulus measures as a way of dragging their economies out of recession .
" we should send a strong message … of our faith in the scope and effectiveness of our own stimulus programs , " the letter said .
while the us and other countries such as japan are pressing for governments to focus on fiscal measures to ward off the recession through more government spending , merkel and sarkozy have both ruled out another round of economic stimulus packages .
commitment to stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has pushed for more spending by countries to ease the global downturn the european approach is seen as overt criticism of an excessive form of capitalism that germany and france blame for the global crisis .
merkel and sarkozy have singled out executive pay , writing that the eu should look at rules to govern sometimes-outlandish corporate wages .
they also said a sanctions mechanism for states that are uncooperative on regulation and transparency should be looked into .
the two leaders also stressed the importance of eu members adhering to the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires them to keep annual public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the letter said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.03.2009 pay slashed , no profit outlook at bmw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo norbert reithofer took a pay cut of 40 percent bmw says the economic crisis prevents it from offering a detailed profit forecast for 2009 .
instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .

in an open letter , the parents of the 17 year old youth who went on a shooting spree that shocked germany last week , express their sorrow .
tim k. , who shot dead 15 in the attack , had been treated for depression . the parents of tim k. , the 17 year old who killed 15 people before turning his father 's pistol on himself in a police shootout that shocked germany last wednesday , have spoken out in public for the first time . in an open letter addressed to the victims , the parents and sister said they had never imagined that tim could be capable of gunning down 12 pupils and teachers at his former school .
he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .
" we keep asking ourselves over and over again how this could happen ?
why did n't we notice his despair and hatred ? " they said in the letter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family home near stuttgart in southwest germany .
" we were a completely normal family " " until this terrible event we were a completely normal family , " they wrote .
" we never thought tim capable of something like this and knew him as a different person . "
the parents had apparently not known that their son was being treated for depression as an outpatient at a psychiatric clinic in the small southwestern town of winnenden , where the fatal school shooting took place .
through their lawyer , who spoke to the german magazine focus over the weekend , they denied he had received any treatment whatsoever .
prosecutors investigating the case argue that tim k. 's depression was a ground for relieving him from germany 's compulsory military service .
they said he had started treatment at the winnenden clinic , but did not follow through with it .
father being investigated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beretta pistol used in the attack had not been locked away .
the family statement was released on tuesday , a day after prosecutors said they were investigating tim 's father on involuntary manslaughter charges for failing to keep the beretta pistol used in the attack safely locked away .
a member of a gun club , tim k. 's father had an arsenal of 15 firearms .
fourteen of them were locked up in accordance to the german law , but prosecutors say the 9 mm .
beretta was not .
" the most valuable and important thing , a beloved person , was taken from you by the horrible and incompressible act of our son and brother , " the letter said .
" we are shocked and stand crying and silent before this incomprehensible tragedy .
we want to express our deepest sympathy to the victims , family and friends .
all of our thoughts are with those afflicted in body and spirit , " the letter continued .
prosecutors in stuttgart have also released the preliminary results of an autopsy which confirmed that tim died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a shootout with the police .
he had also been struck by two police bullets to one of his legs . df / th / ap / dpa / focus / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .

he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "

on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks .

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .

the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending .

" the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year .

the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?
the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending . " in the context of the euro area , guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity , " said trichet . he defended the approach against criticisms that euro interest rates are still too high by noting that the 16 euro-zone countries , which share the european currency , and the united states have " significantly different financial structures . " the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year . " us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke had also said in earlier television interview on sunday that the us could start see " green shoots " of recovery next year . the crisis has triggered the worst recession in decades for germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy and world 's leading exporter , but the outlook could brighten due to a rise in investor confidence , according to experts . " the bottom of the recession is likely to be reached this summer , " wolfgang franz , head of the zew institute , which compiling the confidence index , told the afp news agency . df / sms / afp / reuters / bloomberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts say ecb must lower interest rates further low , lower or even zero ?

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?
the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending . " in the context of the euro area , guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity , " said trichet . he defended the approach against criticisms that euro interest rates are still too high by noting that the 16 euro-zone countries , which share the european currency , and the united states have " significantly different financial structures . " the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year . " us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke had also said in earlier television interview on sunday that the us could start see " green shoots " of recovery next year . the crisis has triggered the worst recession in decades for germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy and world 's leading exporter , but the outlook could brighten due to a rise in investor confidence , according to experts .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .
the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .
the rest of tanriverdi 's body is already decorated with over 30 tattoos , including a massive spider 's web spreading over his neck . but what kind of client is he hoping to attract ? " i do n't mind what they want to put on there , as long as it 's in earnest , " he said .
up to now , the most interest has come from internet shops and - not surprisingly - tattoo companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lasering off a tattoo is not easy or painless customers looking for a bargain may want to take advantage of the price scale tanriverdi has cleverly worked out .
for 500 euros , he 'll wear a tattoo on his head for a year .
starting from 4,000 euros , his scalp can be yours for three years .
and anyone willing to spring for 18,000 euros or more can own the space until the end of tanriverdi 's life . but a dermatologist at the university hospital in muenster has thrown a wrench in the works , warning that tattooing one 's head with the intention of removing the artwork by laser and tattooing anew is not only painful , it 's stupid . " it 's not like using an eraser , " nadine peukert told german news agency dpa .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .

" condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .

modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease .

modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .

in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .
a minority share for gm in a yet-to-be-created joint operation of gm 's european subsidiaries would likely fulfill this requirement .
vague assurances from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clouds hanging over opel 's future have not yet lifted german media reports have been critical of guttenberg for praising the openness of his talks and the " considerable progress " made when proposals from the us , they say , remain too vague .
in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "
rather than a triumphant return for guttenberg , then , it seems his us visit will leave opel workers worrying and hoping that somehow , the german government will offer them the security they crave . dc / th / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .
the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .
the rest of tanriverdi 's body is already decorated with over 30 tattoos , including a massive spider 's web spreading over his neck . but what kind of client is he hoping to attract ? " i do n't mind what they want to put on there , as long as it 's in earnest , " he said .
up to now , the most interest has come from internet shops and - not surprisingly - tattoo companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lasering off a tattoo is not easy or painless customers looking for a bargain may want to take advantage of the price scale tanriverdi has cleverly worked out .
for 500 euros , he 'll wear a tattoo on his head for a year .
starting from 4,000 euros , his scalp can be yours for three years .
and anyone willing to spring for 18,000 euros or more can own the space until the end of tanriverdi 's life . but a dermatologist at the university hospital in muenster has thrown a wrench in the works , warning that tattooing one 's head with the intention of removing the artwork by laser and tattooing anew is not only painful , it 's stupid . " it 's not like using an eraser , " nadine peukert told german news agency dpa .
" afterwards , the skin will look different , and on the scalp , this could easily lead to scarring . " dc / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?
the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending . " in the context of the euro area , guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity , " said trichet . he defended the approach against criticisms that euro interest rates are still too high by noting that the 16 euro-zone countries , which share the european currency , and the united states have " significantly different financial structures . " the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year . " us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke had also said in earlier television interview on sunday that the us could start see " green shoots " of recovery next year . the crisis has triggered the worst recession in decades for germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy and world 's leading exporter , but the outlook could brighten due to a rise in investor confidence , according to experts .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.03.2009 pay slashed , no profit outlook at bmw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo norbert reithofer took a pay cut of 40 percent bmw says the economic crisis prevents it from offering a detailed profit forecast for 2009 .
instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .
a minority share for gm in a yet-to-be-created joint operation of gm 's european subsidiaries would likely fulfill this requirement .
vague assurances from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clouds hanging over opel 's future have not yet lifted german media reports have been critical of guttenberg for praising the openness of his talks and the " considerable progress " made when proposals from the us , they say , remain too vague .
in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "
rather than a triumphant return for guttenberg , then , it seems his us visit will leave opel workers worrying and hoping that somehow , the german government will offer them the security they crave . dc / th / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister : gm has given in on opel stake after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease .

he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault .

he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus .

" the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well .

the pontiff said using condoms could aggravate the problem of aids in africa . the vatican on wednesday , march 18 , defended pope benedict xvi 's comments regarding the use of condoms as a means to prevent the spread of aids .
the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease . " with more than 7,400 new infections each day , the world can not stop the aids epidemic without stopping new hiv infections , " geneva-based unaids said . " condoms are an essential part of combination prevention , " it added , advocating a range of social , behavioral and medical measures . according to the unaids 2008 report on the global aids epidemic , some 22 million people in sub-saharan africa are hiv positive .
some 33 million people worldwide are estimated to be infected with the hiv virus , which can lead to aids . ministers : not using condoms is irresponsible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes small objects can unleash big controversies in germany , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul and health minister ulla schmidt responded to the pope 's comments by saying that condoms are a " decisive " tool in the fight against aids and hiv . aids is " still one of the greatest threats to humanity , " the politicians said at a press conference in berlin .
modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "
he went on to describe benedict 's remarks as " close to premeditated murder . " heavily catholic france also severely criticized the pope 's remarks .
a foreign ministry spokesman called the stance " damaging to health policy , " and said the condom " is an important element in the fight against the spread of the virus . " belgium 's health minister , laurette onkelinx , said the pope 's comments " reflect a dangerous doctrinaire vision -lrb- that could -rrb- demolish years of prevention and education and endanger many human lives . " vatican defends benedict 's stance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crowds of believers cheered the pontiff in cameroon church doctrine opposes the use of contraceptives , including condoms , which in addition to preventing unwanted pregnancies are an effective barrier to hiv / aids .
instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move came in the face of a storm of angry criticism from aids activists , doctors and politicians . on tuesday , the pontiff made his first visit to africa , a continent ravaged by the aids virus .
on the plane ride , he told reporters that rather than contributing to disease prevention , condoms " aggravate the problem . " the solution lies in a " spiritual and human awakening " and " friendship for those who suffer , " said benedict , who is the leading religious figure for the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics . a priest at radio vatican told deutsche welle that the pope 's comments were being blown out of proportion .
he said condoms were helpful in a crisis and added that the spread of aids could be fought by battling against poverty and promoting democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fighting poverty would also fight the spread of aids , a priest told deutsche welle " if africans were as rich as us there would be less aids there , " eberhard von gemmingen , the head of radio vatican 's german section told dw .
" you ca n't just say , ' use condoms and the problem is solved . " ' still , the pope 's comments unleashed a firestorm of controversy among non-governmental organizations and politicians . unaids opposes pontiff on wednesday , the un program against hiv / aids , unaids , rebuked the pope 's comments , saying condoms are an essential and effective component in preventing the disease .

modern development work needs to involve providing access to condoms to the poorest of the poor , they said , adding that anything else is " irresponsible . " german eu parliamentarian wolfgang wodarg , a medical doctor , also criticized the statement .
he told afp news service the pope 's " ideological unworldliness and irresponsible comments " put him " severely at fault . " " we 've had enough of this pope " stronger words were used by german green european deputy daniel cohn bendit , who told french radio simply , " we 've had enough of this pope . "

instead , the catholic church teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage and abstinence are the best ways to stop aids . the vatican defended the pope 's stance .
vatican spokesman father federico lombardi told reporters that benedict was merely " maintaining the position of his predecessors . " the vatican has also said condoms can lead to risky behavior , but many contest that view . kevin de cock , director of the world health organization 's hiv / aids department , told reuters news agency there is no scientific evidence showing that condom use spurs people to take more sexual risks . " the guidance we give is that condoms are highly -lrb- effective -rrb- to prevent the transmission of hiv if they are used correctly and consistently , " he told reuters . there were signs of dissent from within the church , as well . " anyone who has aids and is sexually active , anyone who seeks multiple partners , must protect others and themselves , " said hans-jochen jaschke , roman catholic auxiliary bishop of hamburg , germany . jen / sms / dpa / afp / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the top priority is the putting in place of a new global financial architecture , " the two leaders wrote in their joint letter to the czech eu presidency on tuesday , march 17 .
merkel and sarkozy said the eu should propose the registration , regulation and supervision of all hedge funds and other private investment firms that could pose a systematic risk .
leaders attending the april 2 g20 summit are to debate reforms to the international financial system in light of the global economic crisis .
no new measures the joint letter was the latest signal to washington that france and germany oppose pushing new stimulus measures as a way of dragging their economies out of recession .
" we should send a strong message … of our faith in the scope and effectiveness of our own stimulus programs , " the letter said .
while the us and other countries such as japan are pressing for governments to focus on fiscal measures to ward off the recession through more government spending , merkel and sarkozy have both ruled out another round of economic stimulus packages .
commitment to stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has pushed for more spending by countries to ease the global downturn the european approach is seen as overt criticism of an excessive form of capitalism that germany and france blame for the global crisis .
merkel and sarkozy have singled out executive pay , writing that the eu should look at rules to govern sometimes-outlandish corporate wages .
they also said a sanctions mechanism for states that are uncooperative on regulation and transparency should be looked into .
the two leaders also stressed the importance of eu members adhering to the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires them to keep annual public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product .

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .

the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.03.2009 no breakthrough for guttenberg on opel 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants to be a part of it : guttenberg in new york with 26,000 german jobs hanging in the balance , all eyes were on new economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg as he visited the us to rescue gm 's opel unit .
but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .
a minority share for gm in a yet-to-be-created joint operation of gm 's european subsidiaries would likely fulfill this requirement .
vague assurances from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clouds hanging over opel 's future have not yet lifted german media reports have been critical of guttenberg for praising the openness of his talks and the " considerable progress " made when proposals from the us , they say , remain too vague .
in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "
rather than a triumphant return for guttenberg , then , it seems his us visit will leave opel workers worrying and hoping that somehow , the german government will offer them the security they crave . dc / th / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister : gm has given in on opel stake after talks with gm bosses in washington , german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said carmaker opel could be separated from its ailing parent company .

tim k. , who shot dead 15 in the attack , had been treated for depression . the parents of tim k. , the 17 year old who killed 15 people before turning his father 's pistol on himself in a police shootout that shocked germany last wednesday , have spoken out in public for the first time . in an open letter addressed to the victims , the parents and sister said they had never imagined that tim could be capable of gunning down 12 pupils and teachers at his former school .
he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .
" we keep asking ourselves over and over again how this could happen ?
why did n't we notice his despair and hatred ? " they said in the letter .

the parents had apparently not known that their son was being treated for depression as an outpatient at a psychiatric clinic in the small southwestern town of winnenden , where the fatal school shooting took place .
through their lawyer , who spoke to the german magazine focus over the weekend , they denied he had received any treatment whatsoever .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .

" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .

in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .

net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .

in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.03.2009 pay slashed , no profit outlook at bmw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo norbert reithofer took a pay cut of 40 percent bmw says the economic crisis prevents it from offering a detailed profit forecast for 2009 .
instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .

" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .

" the top priority is the putting in place of a new global financial architecture , " the two leaders wrote in their joint letter to the czech eu presidency on tuesday , march 17 .
merkel and sarkozy said the eu should propose the registration , regulation and supervision of all hedge funds and other private investment firms that could pose a systematic risk .
leaders attending the april 2 g20 summit are to debate reforms to the international financial system in light of the global economic crisis .
no new measures the joint letter was the latest signal to washington that france and germany oppose pushing new stimulus measures as a way of dragging their economies out of recession .
" we should send a strong message … of our faith in the scope and effectiveness of our own stimulus programs , " the letter said .
while the us and other countries such as japan are pressing for governments to focus on fiscal measures to ward off the recession through more government spending , merkel and sarkozy have both ruled out another round of economic stimulus packages .
commitment to stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has pushed for more spending by countries to ease the global downturn the european approach is seen as overt criticism of an excessive form of capitalism that germany and france blame for the global crisis .
merkel and sarkozy have singled out executive pay , writing that the eu should look at rules to govern sometimes-outlandish corporate wages .
they also said a sanctions mechanism for states that are uncooperative on regulation and transparency should be looked into .
the two leaders also stressed the importance of eu members adhering to the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires them to keep annual public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the letter said .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " dfm / th / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an open letter , the parents of the 17 year old youth who went on a shooting spree that shocked germany last week , express their sorrow .
tim k. , who shot dead 15 in the attack , had been treated for depression . the parents of tim k. , the 17 year old who killed 15 people before turning his father 's pistol on himself in a police shootout that shocked germany last wednesday , have spoken out in public for the first time . in an open letter addressed to the victims , the parents and sister said they had never imagined that tim could be capable of gunning down 12 pupils and teachers at his former school .
he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .
" we keep asking ourselves over and over again how this could happen ?
why did n't we notice his despair and hatred ? " they said in the letter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the family home near stuttgart in southwest germany .
" we were a completely normal family " " until this terrible event we were a completely normal family , " they wrote .
" we never thought tim capable of something like this and knew him as a different person . "
the parents had apparently not known that their son was being treated for depression as an outpatient at a psychiatric clinic in the small southwestern town of winnenden , where the fatal school shooting took place .
through their lawyer , who spoke to the german magazine focus over the weekend , they denied he had received any treatment whatsoever .
prosecutors investigating the case argue that tim k. 's depression was a ground for relieving him from germany 's compulsory military service .
they said he had started treatment at the winnenden clinic , but did not follow through with it .
father being investigated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beretta pistol used in the attack had not been locked away .
the family statement was released on tuesday , a day after prosecutors said they were investigating tim 's father on involuntary manslaughter charges for failing to keep the beretta pistol used in the attack safely locked away .
a member of a gun club , tim k. 's father had an arsenal of 15 firearms .
fourteen of them were locked up in accordance to the german law , but prosecutors say the 9 mm .
beretta was not .
" the most valuable and important thing , a beloved person , was taken from you by the horrible and incompressible act of our son and brother , " the letter said .
" we are shocked and stand crying and silent before this incomprehensible tragedy .
we want to express our deepest sympathy to the victims , family and friends .
all of our thoughts are with those afflicted in body and spirit , " the letter continued .
prosecutors in stuttgart have also released the preliminary results of an autopsy which confirmed that tim died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a shootout with the police .
he had also been struck by two police bullets to one of his legs . df / th / ap / dpa / focus / spiegel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .

but what , if anything , did he really achieve ? guttenberg was all smiles in his many photo opportunities during stops in new york and washington earlier this week .
indeed , he said he was " very pleased " with the outcome of talks with us treasury secretary timothy geithner and general motors head richard wagoner .
the future of the troubled carmaker 's european subsidiary , opel , was growing brighter , he said .
but germany 's 26,000 opel workers and an equal number of european workers whose jobs depend on opel 's survival were undoubtedly hoping for something more - an actual concept from gm 's leadership outlining their vision for the future , for example .
as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .
a minority share for gm in a yet-to-be-created joint operation of gm 's european subsidiaries would likely fulfill this requirement .

in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .

as it is , guttenberg was only able to say that gm " supports a european structure for opel " and " is prepared to find solutions that would also authorize a minority participation by gm . "
gm has asked european states to put forth 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- to help the struggling auto giant and its european workers .
but germany wants assurances from the us government that any german public money for opel would not end up in detroit .
a minority share for gm in a yet-to-be-created joint operation of gm 's european subsidiaries would likely fulfill this requirement .
vague assurances from us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clouds hanging over opel 's future have not yet lifted german media reports have been critical of guttenberg for praising the openness of his talks and the " considerable progress " made when proposals from the us , they say , remain too vague .
in an interview aired on zdf public television , guttenberg said that germany and the us would " proceed together " on a solution , but he did n't elaborate .
he said that germany " is still waiting for a substantial concept by the parent company . "
opel 's fate still depends heavily on what decision the us government makes about gm 's own recovery plan , a decision that is expected by a deadline of march 31 .
german news magazine der spiegel has reported that among the german delegation that accompanied guttenberg , there is " frustration " at the stance gm is taking .
" one official said it was ' unbelievable ' how gm had behaved in talks over recent week , " the magazine wrote .
" there 's not much faith in the figures the us auto giant has been quoting in talks . "
rather than a triumphant return for guttenberg , then , it seems his us visit will leave opel workers worrying and hoping that somehow , the german government will offer them the security they crave . dc / th / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the top priority is the putting in place of a new global financial architecture , " the two leaders wrote in their joint letter to the czech eu presidency on tuesday , march 17 .
merkel and sarkozy said the eu should propose the registration , regulation and supervision of all hedge funds and other private investment firms that could pose a systematic risk .
leaders attending the april 2 g20 summit are to debate reforms to the international financial system in light of the global economic crisis .
no new measures the joint letter was the latest signal to washington that france and germany oppose pushing new stimulus measures as a way of dragging their economies out of recession .
" we should send a strong message … of our faith in the scope and effectiveness of our own stimulus programs , " the letter said .
while the us and other countries such as japan are pressing for governments to focus on fiscal measures to ward off the recession through more government spending , merkel and sarkozy have both ruled out another round of economic stimulus packages .

merkel and sarkozy have singled out executive pay , writing that the eu should look at rules to govern sometimes-outlandish corporate wages .
they also said a sanctions mechanism for states that are uncooperative on regulation and transparency should be looked into .
the two leaders also stressed the importance of eu members adhering to the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires them to keep annual public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the letter said .
" healthy public finances thus remain crucial for the credibility and stability of the european union . " dfm / th / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .
the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .
the rest of tanriverdi 's body is already decorated with over 30 tattoos , including a massive spider 's web spreading over his neck . but what kind of client is he hoping to attract ? " i do n't mind what they want to put on there , as long as it 's in earnest , " he said .
up to now , the most interest has come from internet shops and - not surprisingly - tattoo companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lasering off a tattoo is not easy or painless customers looking for a bargain may want to take advantage of the price scale tanriverdi has cleverly worked out .
for 500 euros , he 'll wear a tattoo on his head for a year .
starting from 4,000 euros , his scalp can be yours for three years .
and anyone willing to spring for 18,000 euros or more can own the space until the end of tanriverdi 's life . but a dermatologist at the university hospital in muenster has thrown a wrench in the works , warning that tattooing one 's head with the intention of removing the artwork by laser and tattooing anew is not only painful , it 's stupid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 18.03.2009 pay slashed , no profit outlook at bmw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo norbert reithofer took a pay cut of 40 percent bmw says the economic crisis prevents it from offering a detailed profit forecast for 2009 .
instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .
short-time working extended wednesday 's announcements represented another blow for the world 's leading luxury carmaker , following news last week of a fourth-quarter operating loss of 718 million euros -lrb- $ 935.5 million -rrb- .
net profit plummeted by 89 percent to 330 million euros as sales slumped around the world in the wake of the global recession .
however , reithofer said that after an inevitable decline in sales this year , he expected volumes recovering in 2010 on the back of planned launches of highly profitable models .
a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .
daimler also vague on 2009 outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw and mercedes-benz are saving on parts together meanwhile , bmw 's rival , daimler , has also declined to give a detailed outlook for 2009 , saying only that it expected sales to fall from last year 's level .
in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .
the wolfsburg-based company said it was holding on to its plans for investment and the introduction of new models in china , despite the economic downturn .
vw looks to china for growth vw plans to increase its production this year in its largest foreign market by about 5 percent to 50,000 cars , said winfried vahland , head of volkwagen 's operations in china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen is hoping for a boost from its chinese market the executive said he expected china to overtake germany as vw 's largest market in 2009 or 2010 and to become the world 's largest car market within three years .
" we ourselves want to grow more strongly than the entire market , " vahland said , predicting a profitable 2009 .
volkswagen saw its sales in china rise 12.5 percent last year to more than 1 million cars as the entire domestic car market grew by 8 percent .
the german company plans to introduce five new models this year and at least four next year .
vw also plans to present three cars at the shanghai car show in april that it plans to begin producing in china , including its new golf . dc / th / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , it will focus on a sound business plan in a bid to maintain its independence through what will be a " transition year . " at the company 's annual press conference in munich on wednesday , march 18 , bmw said it expects a further drop in sales this year and announced further cash-saving measures .
" we do n't believe we can reach the sales turnover of 2008 , " ceo norbert reithofer said .
he declined to make a prediction for 2009 , saying it would be a year of transition .
the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .
" our goal is to maintain the bmw group 's independence . "
according to the group 's annual report , reithofer 's pay fell by 39.5 percent to 2.3 million euros .
executive compensation has become a hot button issue in germany , and draft legislation that would tighten the framework on salaries was approved by the government last week .

a bmw spokesman said on wednesday that the company planned to extend short-time working at its plants in the southern german cities of regensburg and dingolfing throughout april and may .
he said this would mean 40,000 fewer cars being produced , in addition to the cutback of 38,000 as a result of short-time working in february and march .

in one aspect , though , the two carmakers have decided it makes sense to stick together : the purchasing of materials and parts .
" we will extend this cooperation and progressively buy more and more parts and components together , " reithofer said .
bmw and daimler 's mercedes-benz division are generating savings of 8 to 15 percent with their joint purchases of items such as tires and electronic components , said herbert diess , bmw 's purchasing chief . a more buoyant mood prevailed on wednesday at volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker .

the company will slash boardroom pay by 40 percent , executive pay by a third , and employee salaries by 10 percent to preserve liquidity .
" i am convinced our employees understand the difficulty of the current situation and are willing to accept this hardship , " reithofer said .

tim k. , who shot dead 15 in the attack , had been treated for depression . the parents of tim k. , the 17 year old who killed 15 people before turning his father 's pistol on himself in a police shootout that shocked germany last wednesday , have spoken out in public for the first time . in an open letter addressed to the victims , the parents and sister said they had never imagined that tim could be capable of gunning down 12 pupils and teachers at his former school .
he also shot a psychiatric worker at the clinic where he was once treated for depression and two bystanders who got in the way as he was fleeing the scene of the crime .
" we keep asking ourselves over and over again how this could happen ?
why did n't we notice his despair and hatred ? " they said in the letter .

the parents had apparently not known that their son was being treated for depression as an outpatient at a psychiatric clinic in the small southwestern town of winnenden , where the fatal school shooting took place .
through their lawyer , who spoke to the german magazine focus over the weekend , they denied he had received any treatment whatsoever .

fourteen of them were locked up in accordance to the german law , but prosecutors say the 9 mm .

" the top priority is the putting in place of a new global financial architecture , " the two leaders wrote in their joint letter to the czech eu presidency on tuesday , march 17 .
merkel and sarkozy said the eu should propose the registration , regulation and supervision of all hedge funds and other private investment firms that could pose a systematic risk .
leaders attending the april 2 g20 summit are to debate reforms to the international financial system in light of the global economic crisis .
no new measures the joint letter was the latest signal to washington that france and germany oppose pushing new stimulus measures as a way of dragging their economies out of recession .
" we should send a strong message … of our faith in the scope and effectiveness of our own stimulus programs , " the letter said .
while the us and other countries such as japan are pressing for governments to focus on fiscal measures to ward off the recession through more government spending , merkel and sarkozy have both ruled out another round of economic stimulus packages .
commitment to stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has pushed for more spending by countries to ease the global downturn the european approach is seen as overt criticism of an excessive form of capitalism that germany and france blame for the global crisis .
merkel and sarkozy have singled out executive pay , writing that the eu should look at rules to govern sometimes-outlandish corporate wages .
they also said a sanctions mechanism for states that are uncooperative on regulation and transparency should be looked into .
the two leaders also stressed the importance of eu members adhering to the bloc 's stability and growth pact , which requires them to keep annual public deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product .
" excessive public indebtedness threatens long-term global stability , " the letter said .

the measures continue to be debated in germany after a fatal school shooting . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games let some people blow off steam , one reader wrote it is hard to me to form an unbiased opinion on the subject as i am a 16-year-old student and a gamer .
i wonder why people play violent video games .
perhaps it is the hunting instinct that has us look for the thrill of danger and / or the domination of an enemy .
perhaps it is living out your aggressive fantasies where you ca n't hurt real people .
the danger is when someone becomes incapable of distinguishing between a game and reality .
i play team fortress 2 to meet online with people i have got to know via the internet and to blow off steam after a hard day of schoolwork .
i would never want to hurt another human - but then , i am rather satisfied with my life .
i would call into question why people get to the point of such despair that they see killing as the only way out .
i , personally , see videogames as a tool , not a cause , and a ban will only enrage the gamer community and add to the " forbidden fruit " effect . - lorenz becker , germany western civilization has entered into a massive mental health crisis .
our citizens , their families , neighborhoods , schools , businesses , bureaus , institutions , clubs , agencies and corporations are sick .
our cultures reek of violence and chaos .
television , movies , video games , music videos , and paperback novels are filled with murder .
denial of ourselves as the root cause of bloody murder and continued projection of the blame upon firearms will only make the problem worse .
deal with the reality . - tom colton , us first let me send my condolences to the families and friends concerned .
whatever happens , or is done , it will not bring back the children .
my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?

my opinion is that when a child like this is receiving psychiatric treatment , the storing of weapons in the household of the family needs to be reviewed until the person is declared returned to normal health .
or there should be constant , possibly , daily observation by the licensing authorities to ensure that all weapons has been securely stored . - michael peter yarnold , peru bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping guns in the house with a person receiving psychological care was negligent , readers wrote violent video games should be banned in germany .
there are so many sports and fun activities that teenagers can take part in .
most teenagers lock themselves in their room and play the kind of games that can gradually corrupt their minds .
the government and authorities must take serious action : ban all such game software . - subashini tremmel , germany you could ban all violent video games from your children 's environment , lock your children off from the internet and sell your televisions , but somewhere , some unbalanced individual will still commit criminal acts .
the person who committed the recent shooting in germany was 17 years old .
his parents are the ones responsible .
if they had raised their child with due attention , they would have noticed any abnormal behavior .
how did a 17-year-old get a firearm ?
any parent that keeps firearms under their roof should educate their children about the danger of firearms and the consequences of misuse . - owen tuckey , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no way to guarantee school shooting will not occur again , readers said your entire article on the school shootings does not include one reference about the parents except that the gun may have come from the father 's collection .
you state what everyone else thinks society should do .
have you totally absolved the parents from responsibility ?
perhaps his problem was at home not at the school .
give a little more balance to your reporting . - barbara dreher , us the question of direct cause and effect between media violence and the school shooting misses the point .
allowing or encouraging young people to play violent games in which they pretend to be killing other people is an abhorrent act on the part of so-called responsible adults in any society .
such games desensitize young people and offer them a model of how to behave when they feel angry .
any society which freely offers such modeling to its young people should not be surprised by frequent violent consequences . - moya smith , new zealand in reference to such incidents as the recent school shootings in germany , this question completely misses the mark .
it wrongly implies that legal weapon sales are to be questioned as a " cause " of this behavior .
germany presently has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world with respect to sales and ownership , yet such incidents still occur . - gerald morris , canada as a retired high school principal in the us and a retired us army officer , i offer the thought that stricter controls at the school , and greater diligence on the part of the school administrators and teachers is better than bans .
the typical panacea offered by politicians is more laws , and they are always so willing to take away more freedoms in the interest of control , power and influence .
i enjoyed living in germany for nine years of my military career , and found german communities absolutely fantastic , and your laws sufficient , even in today 's hectic and ever-changing environment . - jim soper , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- dc / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a cut in interest rates and liquidity guarantees should spur growth . the global financial crisis should give way to an economic recovery starting next year according to the european central bank 's head jean-claude trichet .
he predicted a " moderate " recovery in 2010 . " the year 2009 will be very , very difficult , " he told french radio station europe 1 .
" at the same time , there is a general consensus between all public and private institutions that 2010 may be the year of moderate recovery in growth . " earlier this month , the central bank slashed euro zone prime lending rate to a record low of 1.5 percent to stimulate spending .
trichet said he had not decided whether the current benchmark would be cut further .
analysts and traders told reuters news agency that they expected the ecb to reduce rates to 1 percent or less by the middle of this year . central banks in non-euro industrial nations such as the united states , japan , britain and switzerland have already cut their official rates to nearly zero in a bid to stimulate their struggling economies . ecb guarantees unlimited liquidity to banks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could that be the sound of a recovery ?
the ecb 's focus has been on providing unlimited liquidity to banks in an effort to spur lending . " in the context of the euro area , guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity , " said trichet . he defended the approach against criticisms that euro interest rates are still too high by noting that the 16 euro-zone countries , which share the european currency , and the united states have " significantly different financial structures . " the us economy is driven more by borrowing in more competitive financial markets whereas the euro zone gets more of its funding from banks . us also expects recovery in 2010 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernanke says he sees " green shoots " of recovery on the horizon washington 's imf deputy john lipsky reiterated trichet 's comments , saying that he also expected the global economy to contract this year , but a " return to positive growth in the course of next year . " us federal reserve chairman ben bernanke had also said in earlier television interview on sunday that the us could start see " green shoots " of recovery next year . the crisis has triggered the worst recession in decades for germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy and world 's leading exporter , but the outlook could brighten due to a rise in investor confidence , according to experts .

but even he 's had to admit he was suffering from delusions of grandeur . down on his luck and with debts piling up , a tattoo artist from the german town of coesfeld , racked his brain for a creative money-making scheme .
unfortunately , thomas tanriverdi 's plan to sell ad space on his bald scalp went to his head . tanriverdi was hoping to rake in a whopping 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 65,700 -rrb- from a bidder wanting to tattoo an ad on his pate - that would have been enough money to pay off all his debts in one fell swoop . imagine his disappointment then , when after the first few days of bidding on a large online auction web site , the highest offer was a sobering 355 euros .
but rather than give up on his hare-brained scheme , tanriverdi decided to downsize and aim for the considerably more modest sum of 500 euros for anyone willing to advertise on his head for a year .
after all , he reasoned , it 's not a totally untested market . " others have , with bravura , auctioned their skin for advertising purposes , " the 30-year-old said . in order to boost interest in his " product , " tanriverdi has now embellished his auction offer with a photo .
the words " your ad here " adorn an image of his shiny bald head . it 's pretty much the only space he had to offer .
the rest of tanriverdi 's body is already decorated with over 30 tattoos , including a massive spider 's web spreading over his neck . but what kind of client is he hoping to attract ? " i do n't mind what they want to put on there , as long as it 's in earnest , " he said .
up to now , the most interest has come from internet shops and - not surprisingly - tattoo companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lasering off a tattoo is not easy or painless customers looking for a bargain may want to take advantage of the price scale tanriverdi has cleverly worked out .
for 500 euros , he 'll wear a tattoo on his head for a year .
starting from 4,000 euros , his scalp can be yours for three years .
and anyone willing to spring for 18,000 euros or more can own the space until the end of tanriverdi 's life . but a dermatologist at the university hospital in muenster has thrown a wrench in the works , warning that tattooing one 's head with the intention of removing the artwork by laser and tattooing anew is not only painful , it 's stupid . " it 's not like using an eraser , " nadine peukert told german news agency dpa .

the nature of live broadcasting means that neither the bbc nor the participants in the programme can guarantee the accuracy of the information here . money box live presenter : vincent duggleby transmission : 18th march 2009 3.00-3.30 radio 4
<p>
duggleby : good afternoon .
with little more than two weeks to the end of the tax year , there ’ s not much time left to save tax in 2008-09 .
usually we ’ d have had the spring budget by now , but because the g20 economic summit is being held in london early next month , it ’ s been delayed until 22nd april .
however , tax allowances for the coming year are already known because they were announced in the pre- budget report last november , along with the cut in vat .
the new top rate of 45 % and the increase in national insurance doesn ’ t come in till 2011 .
so we ’ re looking for new rules you may have forgotten about , such as the annual investment allowance of £ 50,000 for small businesses ; flat rate capital gains tax of 18 % , remembering that gains up to £ 9,600 are tax free .
you may need to find out how to establish losses in the present markets .
and with wages and salaries under pressure , you might want to discuss the tax consequences of redundancy or have a look at the benefits of a company car or extra pension contributions .
there are rumours the budget will contain measures to encourage savers badly hit by falling interest rates .
we shall have to wait and see .
in the meantime , you should be perhaps looking at inheritance tax planning , especially where an estate has been hit by falling property and share prices . just some of the ideas you may wish to discuss with my two guests on money box live .
jane moore is technical manager at the tax faculty of the institute of chartered accountants and she ’ s particularly concerned about inland revenue final demands and missed deadlines for paying tax .
john whiting from pricewaterhousecoopers warns that notices of coding should be carefully checked , especially by pensioners turning 65 .

<p>
line is andrew in poole .
hello andrew ?
andrew : hello . duggleby : your call . andrew : yes , good afternoon .
recently i had a small company .
i was the sole trader working as an it contractor .
and i closed the company last august and there were some cash assets which i now have and i ’ ll have to pay capital gains tax on those assets .
and i was wondering whether i can offset some of that cost against losses i will make by selling some shares in a bank , a uk bank ?
duggleby : yeah , well they of course have fallen dramatically in the last year or so . andrew : absolutely .
now i ’ d accumulated these shares over a period of time .
i was taking dividends in shares and , as you ’ ve said , i ’ ve actually accrued quite a loss on saving . duggleby : okay , well the question you ’ re asking really is can you offset a loss on shares against a business profit ?
andrew : yep . duggleby : okay .
john ?
whiting : if these are both capital losses , yes you can .
and before we probe a little , let ’ s be clear .
if you make a capital loss , a capital gains loss , the only thing you can do with that is set it against a proper capital gain in the same or subsequent year . there ’ s no carry back .
so first thing , and i think andrew seems to be well prompted with this , is get the years right - and he ’ s doing this - because obviously the fatal thing is to make a gain in this year , pay tax on it , and then make your loss next year . 2
<p>
duggleby : yuh .
so , andrew , you ’ ve got your gains stacked up as it were .
so it ’ s now a question of you know do you want to offset it ?
or i suspect , john , the answer would be it would be silly not to offset it ?
whiting : well , yes .
the slight bit of probing i wanted to do is be absolutely sure that the gains that andrew ’ s talking about are actually capital gains that he ’ s made because , andrew , you talked about closing your business .
because of course if it ’ s … did you have a company that you were trading through , or was it just you ?
andrew : it was just me . whiting : oh , right .
so these are actual capital gains made on assets that you sold . you happened to use them in the business , but they were in your name ?
