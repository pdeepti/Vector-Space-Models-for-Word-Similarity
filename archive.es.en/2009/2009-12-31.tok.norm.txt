as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .

al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .

iceland is to pay around 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- over the next 14 years .

a poll taken in august suggested nearly 70 percent of the population were against the icesave deal , as the cost of compensation amounts to nearly 12,000 euros per citizen .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 31.12.2009 the netherlands respond to flooding with swimming homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighborhoods may soon float on the water near the hague do houses have to be built on solid land ?
in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .

acts of violence against bloggers is also on the rise . there were 76 journalists killed in 2009 , compared to 60 in 2008 , according to figures from the advocacy group .
additionally , more than 2,000 journalists were arrested , kidnapped , assaulted and / or censored .
among the events making 2009 a black year for reporters was the massacre of 30 journalists in the philippines in november .
in nearly all of the cases , journalists were killed while reporting on violence or corruption in their own countries , says vincent brossel of reporters without borders .
" the journalists who are really in danger and who are really on the front line are the local journalists and not the foreign correspondents , " brossel told deutsche welle .
in 2009 a total of 573 journalists were arrested , 33 were kidnapped , 1,456 were physically assaulted and 157 others fled their countries fearing violence , according to the group .
iran and sri lanka were high on the list of countries from which journalists fled .

" governments in china and iran are trying to prevent new media -lrb- i.e. social networking , mobile phones etc . -rrb- from being used by people who want to create a civil society , " brossel told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

iceland is to pay around 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- over the next 14 years .
prior to its collapse during the credit crunch icesave had used high interest rates to attract customers from abroad . the bill , which was approved by a vote of 33 to 30 in parliament , removes what had been seen as a barrier to iceland 's bid to enter the european union .
legislation unpopular with icelanders although the measure was approved , ordinary icelanders hit hard by the global economic downturn tend to resent it .
a poll taken in august suggested nearly 70 percent of the population were against the icesave deal , as the cost of compensation amounts to nearly 12,000 euros per citizen .
however , finance minister steingrimur sigfusson insisted that the deal was necessary .
" approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage , " he said .
" history will show that we are doing the right thing . "

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 31.12.2009 the netherlands respond to flooding with swimming homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighborhoods may soon float on the water near the hague do houses have to be built on solid land ?
in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany has its own particular rituals when it comes to luck . whether it 's eating lentils in brazil , wearing flowers in india , or exchanging eggs in ancient persia , for millennia people have performed rituals in their hope for a fresh start on new year 's day - regardless of which calendar they use . they 've also used different methods to get an inkling of what the future will bring .
in germany , people regularly began bleigiessen , or " pouring lead , " to divine their futures around 1900 , according to alois doering , an expert in regional traditions at the institute for applied geography and regional history -lrb- lvr -rrb- in bonn .
records of the custom in germany , however , date as far back as the middle ages .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what will the new year hold ?
it goes something like this : after a festive dinner on new year 's eve , or silvester , as it 's called in german , people sit in a circle and alternately melt lead -lrb- or sometimes wax -rrb- on a spoon held above a candle .
the molten lead is then poured into a vessel of cold water , where it immediately hardens .
the future in various shapes the group then interprets the shape of the hardened lead , which becomes an indicator of what the future has in store for the lead pourer .
a ring or heart could mean marriage , an egg could herald an addition to the family , a tree could imply growth in one 's capabilities , an angel could signify that the person will experience goodwill .
and a boat or car could indicate an upcoming trip .
there are also far-fetched interpretations , like the shape of a pineapple pointing to unrequited love .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pouring lead has enjoyed greater popularity in recent years pouring lead is a custom that was practiced thousands of years ago in ancient greece .
it was done throughout the year to understand not just what path one 's personal life could take , but also to help forecast the political future , doering noted .
over the centuries and across continents , people have read everything from tea leaves , to coffee grounds , to crystal balls .
hundreds of years ago , as young women sat around peeling potatoes for dinner , they would try to " read " the letters of their future husbands ' names from the peels on the floor , doering said .
" but pouring lead is special because it 's festive , which is why people like doing it as a group on new year 's eve , " doering told deutsche welle .
making sense of it all he also noted that rituals in general - drinking champagne and kissing at midnight on new year 's eve , baptizing babies , or remembering loved ones with a funeral service - are fundamental for communication between human beings and mark passages through life .
also , the more isolated people become , the more significant rituals are in re-establishing personal ties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : here 's to the future !
" as we progress in this world of high-tech or try to grapple with this financial crisis , fears among people begin to mount , " doering said .
" and then people take an increased interest in superstitions , the irrational and the mystical . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .

iceland is to pay around 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- over the next 14 years .
prior to its collapse during the credit crunch icesave had used high interest rates to attract customers from abroad . the bill , which was approved by a vote of 33 to 30 in parliament , removes what had been seen as a barrier to iceland 's bid to enter the european union .
legislation unpopular with icelanders although the measure was approved , ordinary icelanders hit hard by the global economic downturn tend to resent it .
a poll taken in august suggested nearly 70 percent of the population were against the icesave deal , as the cost of compensation amounts to nearly 12,000 euros per citizen .
however , finance minister steingrimur sigfusson insisted that the deal was necessary .
" approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .

the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

dw-world.de the eu 's reform treaty comes into force the lisbon treaty is as thick as a good novel , but not quite as thrilling to read .
now the reform treaty has entered into force across the eu .
but what changes will it bring to the 27-nation bloc ? -lrb- 02.12.2009 -rrb- who are europe 's new top politicians ?
the european union has chosen two little-known politicians for the new top positions within the bloc .
dw looks at belgian herman van rompuy and british catherine ashton who will be at the head of the eu .
-lrb- 20.11.2009 -rrb- sweden refuses to condemn organ theft story that shocked israel swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt has rejected calls from israel to condemn claims made by a tabloid newspaper that israeli soldiers stole organs from the bodies of dead palestinians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .

depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .

iceland is to pay around 3.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- over the next 14 years .
prior to its collapse during the credit crunch icesave had used high interest rates to attract customers from abroad . the bill , which was approved by a vote of 33 to 30 in parliament , removes what had been seen as a barrier to iceland 's bid to enter the european union .
legislation unpopular with icelanders although the measure was approved , ordinary icelanders hit hard by the global economic downturn tend to resent it .
a poll taken in august suggested nearly 70 percent of the population were against the icesave deal , as the cost of compensation amounts to nearly 12,000 euros per citizen .
however , finance minister steingrimur sigfusson insisted that the deal was necessary .
" approving the bill is the better option and will avoid even more economic damage , " he said .
" history will show that we are doing the right thing . "

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .
following the incident , bildt called off a visit to israel in september .
polish parliamentarian michal tomasz kaminski said the controversy was an example of how things were run within sweden 's eu presidency .
" i think that the unnecessary crisis related to the unfortunate article in the swedish paper about the israeli soldiers , " kaminski said .
" i think the problems that emerged mark how negatively things have been directed over the past six months . "
handing over to spain sweden may have been too heavy-handed regarding foreign policy , but spain , as the incoming chair of the presidency , wo n't have any say in eu foreign policy .
the recently ratified lisbon treaty created a new position within the eu : the first high representative for foreign affairs and security policy is great britain 's catherine ashton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moratinos wants to see clear signs of economic recovery during the spanish eu presidency that means spain will have to focus its presidency on areas other than foreign policy .
the country hopes to prioritize the implementation of new institutional rules , discussions on the european convention of human rights , and economic recovery in europe .
spanish foreign minister miguel moratinos highlighted the importance of recovery in particular .
" we want to use these six months to navigate a way out of the crisis , but also to put good conditions in place for europe 's sustainable growth so we can move forward in science and innovation , " he said .
" we want the sort of development that creates employment and guarantees the economic and competitive future of all 500 million european citizens . "
uncertain role spain will also chair meetings of the general affairs and external relations council in brussels and has divided other responsibilities of the presidency among its regions .
for example , catalonia will be hosting environment and fisheries councils .
the spanish government also wants to tackle issues such as domestic violence and terrorism .
moratinos said spain wants to create a " european observatory " for the fight against domestic violence , and address judicial issues that protect women from violence .
as sweden 's turn with the eu presidency comes to an end , there is a sense that the rotating role in the eu will never be the same again .
in addition to the new foreign policy chief , the lisbon treaty created the position of an eu president , the first of whom is former belgian prime minister herman van rompuy .
rompuy will take over many of the major duties previously performed by the country sitting in the driver 's seat , leaving spain with the tricky task of redefining the role of the eu 's rotating presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 31.12.2009 the netherlands respond to flooding with swimming homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neighborhoods may soon float on the water near the hague do houses have to be built on solid land ?
in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .

a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .
" this is the purpose of the afghanistan conference at the end of january in london , " she added. rb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .

aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 31.12.2009 increased us military involvement in yemen could boomerang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is stepping up its efforts to combat al qaeda in yemen the obama administration has in recent months stepped up its intelligence support and funding of yemeni security forces in a bid to counter threats by al qaeda to attack western and arab targets in the gulf . yemeni officials say more than 30 operatives of al qaeda 's yemeni offshoot , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , were killed and 29 others captured in raids in recent weeks that foiled attacks on the british embassy in the capital sana 'a and yemeni oil facilities .
human rights activists and al qaeda charge that scores of innocent civilians died in the attacks .
us support for the raids reflects concerns on both sides of the atlantic that multiple conflicts in yemen - including the fight against al qaeda , a five-year war against tribal rebels in the north that has dragged neighboring saudi arabia into the hostilities , a secession movement in the south , rampant inflation and unemployment , dwindling oil revenues and an acute water shortage - could turn yemen into the strategic region 's next failed state alongside somalia .
" we are already a failed state .
we can no longer protect the rights of our citizens , " said yemeni opposition politician abubakr badeeb . " al qaeda is renewing itself and has sympathizers in the yemeni security and intelligence forces , " terrorism expert said ali jemhi told deutsche welle .
analysts say the us intelligence and military support kicked in since the yemeni government recently bowed to us , european and saudi pressure to focus more on battling al qaeda rather than exclusively on squashing a tribal revolt in the north by al-houthi rebels and secession in the south .
yemeni officials complained as recently as october that the country 's allies were ignoring problems that constituted as much a threat to yemen 's stability and territorial integrity as does al qaeda .
al qaeda threatens regional stability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemeni security forces are concerned that al qaeda is growing in strength yet , al qaeda threatens both regional stability and international security while other rebel groups in the country constitute primarily a threat to yemen itself .
" the houthi rebellion is not a threat to saudi arabia , overall instability in yemen is , " christopher boucek , a yemen expert at the washington-based carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle .
analysts say the yemeni concession was motivated in part by reports from arab and western intelligence agencies that a growing number of islamist militants were moving from afghanistan and pakistan to yemen .
" the air strikes signal a dramatic change in the war on terrorism in yemen , " mohammed saif haidar , a yemeni researcher who focuses on al qaeda , told deutsche welle .
the pentagon allocated this year $ 70 million -lrb- 48 million euros -rrb- to support yemeni security forces .
in a bid to avoid an anti-us backlash that would fuel yemen 's multiple conflicts , the us is seeking to maintain a low-key presence .
increased activity at the us embassy in sana 'a as witnessed by this reporter on several trips to yemen in recent months may be one of the most visible indications of stepped-up us activity in yemen .
nonetheless , us officials have begun to acknowledge their country 's greater involvement in fighting al qaeda in yemen .
speaking on us television , us senate homeland security committee chairman joseph lieberman said " the united states had a growing presence " in yemen that involved special operations forces and intelligence agents . yemen could be the next afghanistan one of a string of us officials and politicians to have recently visited sana 'a , lieberman quoted a us official in the yemeni capital as saying that " iraq was yesterday 's war .
afghanistan is today 's war .
if we do n't act preemptively , yemen will be tomorrow 's war . "
earlier , us national counter terrorism center director mark leiter described yemen in congressional testimony as " a key battleground and potential regional base of operations from which al qaeda can plan attacks , train recruits , and facilitate the movement of operatives . "
the foiled christmas day airplane bombing appears to confirm leiter 's description although the link between al qaeda and nigerian student umar farouk abdulmuttalab , accused of igniting explosives on the northwest flight , remains as yet tenuous .
us law enforcement agents are investigating abdulmutallab 's claim that he was trained to use the explosives in yemen where al qaeda operatives gave him the device with which he boarded the detroit-bound flight .
yemen 's anti-aqap operations target the group 's leadership .
a pre-christmas raid on an alleged aqap leadership meeting failed to kill aqap leader nasser al-wahayshi or anwar al-awlaqi , a militant american imam of yemeni descent who is believed to have been at the meeting although he is not an aqap member .
al-awlaqi reportedly was in email contact with maj. nidal hasan before the us army psychiatrist was charged with killing 13 people in a shooting attack at a military base in fort hood , texas , in november .
analysts say the foiled airplane bombing and the fort hood shooting reflect a new strategy in which individual aqap operatives employing small amounts of explosives attack their targets .
the strategy was first implemented when a saudi aqap member last august attempted to kill deputy saudi interior minister prince mohammed bin nayef in a failed suicide attack using explosives concealed in his underpants . al qaeda targeting westerners in gulf region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda 's offshoot in yemen is targeting western interests throughout the gulf region the analysts say aqap may be reverting to the targeting of expatriates in the gulf akin to the suicide attacks in 2003 and 2004 on expatriate compounds in saudi arabia .
those attacks undermined public empathy for the group and sparked a successful saudi crackdown .
remnants of the saudi militant group shifted to yemen and in early 2009 merged with yemeni al qaeda operatives to form aqap .
in an indication of aqap 's relative strength , yemeni officials cautioned this reporter in october not to visit the central province of mareb because they could not guarantee his safety .
" yemen is rapidly becoming an important front " for al qaeda because the government " is less and less able to exercise control throughout the complete territory of the country , " said yemen expert boucek .
aqap 's strength poses not only a security challenge to the obama administration but also a political headache .
it threatens to derail the possible transfer of more than 100 yemeni detainees in guantanamo bay back to their homeland , a key part of president barack obama 's effort to shut down the controversial facility .
us officials fear that yemen 's embattled government may not be able to control the detainees or , worse even , that sympathetic security officials could simply release them .
at least two saudis released from guantanamo have since joined aqap .
one of them , said ali al-shihri , is believed to have been involved in a 2008 attack on the us embassy in sana 'a .
aqap leader al wahayshi , writing in the october edition of sada al-malahim -lrb- echo of war -rrb- , the group 's magazine , laid out aqap 's new terrorist tactics and urged militants to attack gulf leaders and expatriates as well as western air and ground transport .
" you do not need to make a huge effort , or spend large amounts of money to assemble 10 grams of explosives . ...
the -lrb- necessary -rrb- materials can be found in your mother 's kitchen . shape the material into a grenade that you can throw or ignite with a timer from a distance or a suicide belt … attack any tyrant , den of intelligence forces , prince , minister , or crusader wherever you find them as well as airports in western crusader countries that participated in the war against muslims , their planes , residential complexes or subways , " al-wahayshi said . analysts warn that us involvement in military operations aimed to stop aqap in its tracks could boomerang if they involve increased civilian casualties given the yemen government 's fragility .
princeton university yemen expert gregory johnson told deutsche welle that pictures of dead women and children such as the ones that circulated after the most recent raids could make " recruiting a field day for al qaeda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 31.12.2009 sweden wraps up six months in eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden leaves behind a mixed legacy as it wraps up its presidency the swedish government hands over the eu 's rotating six-month presidency to spain on january 1 .
as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .

as the year comes to an end , the eu is bracing itself for a somewhat uncertain transitional period under a new set of rules . according to swedish prime minister frederik reinfeldt , all of his goals for the european union presidency have been achieved .
among the accomplishments sweden claims from its six-month run of the rotating presidency are securing the ratification of the lisbon treaty , tackling the baltic sea 's environmental problems , and bringing visa-free travel to certain balkan states in europe 's borderless schengen zone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinfeldt is satisfied with sweden 's turn at the helm reinfeldt also takes credit for firming up the eu 's position on climate change .
" we agreed on a long term goal for emission reductions of 80 to 95 percent by 2050 , " reinfeldt said .
" we renewed our offer to reduce our emissions by 30 percent , provided that others make comparable efforts . "
the swedish government has also been praised by some eu officials for its transparency and efficiency .
reaching too far in foreign affairs ?
but despite pats on the back from reinfeldt and others , not everyone agrees on the degree of success achieved by sweden over the past six months .
several eu diplomats say the swedish prime minister was in fact not very transparent when he was consulting member states on how to fill top eu posts .
sweden has also been criticized for being too assertive on certain foreign policy issues .
one of the biggest examples was a call by swedish foreign minister carl bildt for east jerusalem to be declared the future capital of an independent palestinian state .
other eu members responded in a subtler manner , calling instead for talks on the status of jerusalem .
bildt also accused israel of being the country of " divide and rule " in trying to stop eu governments from backing the proposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a swedish newspaper article further strained relations with israel the relationship between sweden and israel suffered further strain when a report surfaced in a swedish newspaper accusing the israeli army of harvesting the organs of dead palestinians .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .
" politically , we must and we will create the conditions to hand over responsibility to the afghan people in the coming years , step by step , " merkel said .

" i tell you very openly , we can not expect the economic downturn to be over quickly , " she said .
" some things will initially be more difficult next year before they can improve . "
she said that germany , which has europe 's biggest economy , would continue to fight for new international rules for financial markets " so that the combination of excess and irresponsibility can , in future , be prevented in time . "
actions taken in the coming year will determine how germany emerges from the crisis , and whether it lays the groundwork to avert a similar debacle , she said .
the chancellor , who won a second term in office in last september 's general election , said her center-right government would work with business leaders and banks to ensure that companies , particularly small and medium-sized firms , can survive a nagging credit crunch .
the government expects the economy to grow by 1.2 percent in 2010 , after slumping by almost 5 percent this year in germany 's worst decline since world war ii .
but next year 's budget foresees a record 85 billion euros -lrb- $ 122 billion -rrb- in new debt .
confronting climate change merkel also said that although the economic slowdown had created severe problems for the world 's developed nations , it must not prevent them from confronting climate change after the failure of this month 's copenhagen summit .
" the global crisis must not serve as an excuse to brush aside other challenges facing humanity , " she said .
" industry and environmental protection are not in opposition , they rely on each other , now more than ever .
we must not let ourselves be put off by setbacks such as the climate conference in copenhagen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 4,500 bundeswehr soldiers are currently deployed in afghanistan securing stability in afghanistan chancellor merkel also said that germany still had an important mission to complete in afghanistan .
in a reference to the 4,500 german soldiers working in afghanistan , she said that the government " knows of the difficulty and danger of their mission . "
as the bundeswehr mission in afghanistan becomes increasingly unpopular in germany , the government has voiced support for us president barack obama 's timetable to begin withdrawing from afghanistan in 2011 , but has not yet made new commitments to a proposed troop surge ahead of that date .

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in response to the climate-induced rise in water level , the netherlands are turning to an unusual new kind of architecture .
soon , some neighborhoods may float on water . dutch architect koen olthuis says it 's better for a country that 's threatened by water to learn how to live with it than fight against it - an approach that is central to his work . the netherlands are one of the most densely populated yet also flattest countries in europe .
the offices of olthuis ' firm are beneath sea-level , as is about a third of the terrain in the netherlands .
water must constantly be pumped back into the sea . " we pump away about as much water daily as tokyo and its surroundings use in a year - an incredible amount , " said olthuis , who decided to specialize in water architecture . making flooding valuable the architect and his team have developed a concept for their country 's future : if the dutch eventually have to allow water to take over some of the nation 's coastal land surface , the wet area should be used for houses and apartments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect koen olthuis specializes in water architecture areas threatened by flooding account for about five percent of the netherlands ' surface .
currently , they are protected from being overtaken by the sea through the use of dams .
keeping this land dry costs the nation billions annually . near the hague , a joint public and private project called " het nieuwe water " is underway , which foresees building 1,200 new buildings within the next eight to ten years .
some of these are to be floating luxury apartments .
at present , though , there is little to be seen in the area - just a 2.5-kilometer -lrb- 1.5-mile -rrb- slushy field occupied by a few homes , greenhouses and a pond . " first we will build , then we will allow the area to be flooded , " explained paul van zundert , an engineer , who will ensure that the residents do not encounter any problems once building begins .
" that will be the biggest challenge that arises from this new dual approach to using the water . " the economic utility of the new buildings will hopefully compensate for the loss of the area 's greenhouses . floating neighborhoods architect olthuis would eventually like to move with his wife and three kids to the flooded coastal area .
a single family home there will not be more expensive than a traditional home , he pointed out . " people are n't interested in having to pay even extra to live on the water .
so the only way to go about things is to make the cost of living on the water match that of living on land , " he said .
depending on how it is equipped , a floating house will cost several hundred thousand euros . the new generation of floating houses has little to do with traditional house boats .
olthuis foresees large platforms which contain everything that belongs in a conventional neighborhood : streets , greenery and rows of houses . " climate change is causing water to take up space in cities - area that cities ca n't afford to give up , " said the architect .
water collecting in a city center is worthless , he added , but if it can be used as a building site , then it becomes valuable . the idea is taking hold abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smaller houses may also be built to float on the water 's surface by using flexible tubes , the floating platforms will be provided with electricity and hooked up to the sewage system .
oil platforms currently use similar technologies .
but the plans go beyond just building houses on the water . according to olthuis , the company waterstudio.nl has already received requests from foreigners interested in floating water parks or golf courses . the city of seoul has inquired about a floating park for its downtown area .
there is no land available in the area , but there is a river that runs through the city .
and a floating mosque in dubai is also in the works .
the mosque will only be reachable by boat , and it is equipped for local climate conditions . " we will pump sea water through the walls of the structure so as to cool the building from 50 to 30 degrees celsius .
that will save a lot of energy , " olthuis said . author : susanne henn -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
