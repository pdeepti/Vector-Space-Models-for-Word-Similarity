program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.11.2009 bremen held by wolfsburg , but still ease into first place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mertesacker 's header was the difference between a loss and a draw werder left it very late before getting back to level terms with wolfsburg , while lead-pack rivals hoffenheim and hamburg dropped points they ’ d had for the taking . german national team stalwart per mertesacker got a 90th minute equalizer for werder bremen , putting them back on top of the bundesliga and extending their run of matches without a loss , across all competitions , to 21 .
the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .
neither managed to score .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .
the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , however , remains highly unpopular in germany. rb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .
neither managed to score .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.11.2009 hungarian radio scandal highlights lingering corruption problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary has admitted it has a corruption problem the closing of radio stations by the hungarian government has raised new concerns about corruption .
ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

" we will speak with the representatives of financial institutions about what we can do to avoid a credit crunch that would put the brakes on economic recovery , " she added , referring to the meeting scheduled for wednesday .
merkel acknowledged that it was right for banks to be careful , but urged them not to be too hesitant in lending money .
she also reminded them that as service providers to the economy , they also had a responsibility towards the whole of society .
" that is why we will say very clearly that they must fulfil this function , " merkel said .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .
the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , however , remains highly unpopular in germany. rb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .
neither managed to score .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .

google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for an investigative committee set up by russia 's fsb domestic intelligence service , told the interfax news agency .
he said the committee had found fragments of a large bomb at the scene of the luxury train 's crash . fsb head alexsander bortnikov , reporting to russian president dmitry medvedev in a televised meeting , said his investigators estimated the bomb packed the punch of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .

ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .

ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner .

emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de french , german publishers step up campaign against google books the internet giant ’ s project to digitize millions of books is up and running , but some in europe ’ s book industry are still hoping to cut a better deal .
-lrb- 24.09.2009 -rrb- european publishers not yet on the same page as google books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online .
-lrb- 17.09.2009 -rrb- germany calls on us court to reject google book settlement the german government has officially expressed its opposition to plans by internet search giant google to digitize millions of books .

hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .

mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .

the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .

many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .
18 .
many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.11.2009 bulgaria fights uphill battle against trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of trafficking are often sold into prostitution bulgaria has long struggled with corruption that has allowed human trafficking and organized crime to spread beyond its borders .
but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .
neither managed to score .

ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .

emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .

the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .
18 .
many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .

7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .

more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .

" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for an investigative committee set up by russia 's fsb domestic intelligence service , told the interfax news agency .
he said the committee had found fragments of a large bomb at the scene of the luxury train 's crash . fsb head alexsander bortnikov , reporting to russian president dmitry medvedev in a televised meeting , said his investigators estimated the bomb packed the punch of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
the " nevsky express " was headed to st. petersburg from moscow when the last three cars went off the tracks about 350 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- from moscow at 9:34 pm local time -lrb- 6:34 pm utc -rrb- , on friday , november 27 .
661 passengers were on board at the time of the crash .

russian president dmitry medvedev has been kept informed about the derailment , which has delayed some 27,000 people as transport officials have been scambling to divert trains along other , often slower routes .
the same rail line was targeted in august 2007 , when a bomb derailed a train , injuring 60 passengers .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .
the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , however , remains highly unpopular in germany. rb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.11.2009 hungarian radio scandal highlights lingering corruption problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary has admitted it has a corruption problem the closing of radio stations by the hungarian government has raised new concerns about corruption .
ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.11.2009 hungarian radio scandal highlights lingering corruption problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary has admitted it has a corruption problem the closing of radio stations by the hungarian government has raised new concerns about corruption .
ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .

the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .

copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .

just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .

bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .

he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .

the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 28.11.2009 hungarian radio scandal highlights lingering corruption problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary has admitted it has a corruption problem the closing of radio stations by the hungarian government has raised new concerns about corruption .
ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

for the approximately 1,800 iraqi refugees in germany , while it is not always easy to feel at home , many see their futures here . after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , around two million iraqis fled to neighboring syria and jordan , where many lived in extreme poverty .
in november 2008 , the eu 's interior minister announced the bloc would take in up to 10,000 of those iraqis in need of protection as part of efforts to alleviate the refugee crisis .
germany currently hosts 1,800 iraqi refugees and has pledged to take in as many as 2,500 under the eu deal .
challenges in the classroom one-third of the iraqis here are under the age of sixteen - among them , twelve-year-old ahmed from baghdad .
he arrives on time to german class , as he wants to improve his language skills as quickly as possible .
his goal is to make the most of his new life , and he pushes himself hard .
the class takes place in a small and simple room with wooden tables and plastic chairs in blue , yellow and orange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-third of germany 's 1,800 iraqi refugees are under the age of sixteen in addition to ahmed , there are seven other children between the ages of ten and fifteen who attend .
they receive thirteen hours of extra class time per week outside of their regular school schedule - but they still do n't understand much and are still at a basic level .
today , the students are learning how to write the word " mama . "
the class is not only a challenge for the students , but also for the teacher , who does n't speak a word of arabic .
the children are indeed willing to learn , she said , but they can also be unruly .
" this is understandable .
we do n't know what these children have been through in their lives so far , " she says .
peace in germany after class , ahmed goes straight home .
he lives with his mother and two younger sisters in the so-called " transitional home for refugees . "
four iraqi families live in the four-story house .
ahmed runs up the dirty staircase to the second floor and knocks on the door of apartment number 22 .
behind it is the one room his family members have all shared since they came to germany six weeks ago .
" in iraq it was very difficult .
we came to germany to have a better life - without injustice and oppression .
in iraq we lived in a constant state of fear and stress .
here in germany , peace and order rules .
i wish for peace for all the children who still live in iraq , " says ahmed , visibly content to be in germany .
memories of death and violence flowers sit on the window sill - ahmed 's mother has made a great effort to make their home more beautiful .
she is in her mid-thirties and wears a plain headscarf .
" everything is in order here , " she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around half of the iraqi refugees are christian but previously , everything was not in order .
memories from their last days in iraq keep coming back up .
" they threatened me and my children because i worked for an american firm in the green zone in baghdad .
they pushed my son and punched out two of his teeth , " she says .
they threatened to kill the family if they did n't leave of iraq .
ahmed 's mother takes out a photo showing an overturned desk chair and a hole in the ceiling after an attack on her office .
shiite militias had also attacked people in a residential neighborhood with baseball bats - and abducted twenty-five of them .
two of ahmed 's uncles were shot .
ahmed also has bad memories from his homeland .
he and other people were shot at as they tried to buy bread .
" a bullet flew by and just narrowly missed my face , " he says , falling silent .
father and grandparents left behind ahmed 's family fled to syria in 2006 where they applied for asylum at the un refugee agency . after a long wait they finally received an answer - germany would take them .
refugees from iraq receive a three-year residence and work permit .
around half of the refugees are christian .
others , like ahmed 's neighbors , belong to the religious mandaean minority , whose beliefs contain elements of judaism , christianity and gnosticism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of iraqis have fled to syria and jordan when ahmed remembers his first day in germany , he begins to cry .
he thinks of his father and grandparents who had to stay behind in syria .
but then he remembers what he likes about germany .
" in germany , the teachers speak politely to the students .
they respect them and make a big effort .
in iraq , children were hit .
here it is different and i feel happy . "
and finally , ahmed can play football again - his passion .
on tv and on the internet he can follow his favorite club , fc barcelona .
ahmed and his sisters also speak to their father almost every day over the computer .
they tell him that germany is cold ; that it is wonderful to take the streetcar ; and they report on their trip to the zoo .
and they always ask him the same question - when will you get here ?

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .

he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "

he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .

brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .
18 .
many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .

the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de french , german publishers step up campaign against google books the internet giant ’ s project to digitize millions of books is up and running , but some in europe ’ s book industry are still hoping to cut a better deal .
-lrb- 24.09.2009 -rrb- european publishers not yet on the same page as google books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online .
-lrb- 17.09.2009 -rrb- germany calls on us court to reject google book settlement the german government has officially expressed its opposition to plans by internet search giant google to digitize millions of books .

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

" we are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for an investigative committee set up by russia 's fsb domestic intelligence service , told the interfax news agency .
he said the committee had found fragments of a large bomb at the scene of the luxury train 's crash . fsb head alexsander bortnikov , reporting to russian president dmitry medvedev in a televised meeting , said his investigators estimated the bomb packed the punch of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .
the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , however , remains highly unpopular in germany. rb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 28.11.2009 european ministers step up to the plate against google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers say book digitization should not be a private undertaking european union ministers have agreed to move forward with plans to counter plans by internet giant google to create an immense digital library .
they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de french , german publishers step up campaign against google books the internet giant ’ s project to digitize millions of books is up and running , but some in europe ’ s book industry are still hoping to cut a better deal .
-lrb- 24.09.2009 -rrb- european publishers not yet on the same page as google books google books and most european countries are still at odds over whether the internet giant will be allowed to extend it 's business model from the us to europe - scanning books and selling them in digital form online .
-lrb- 17.09.2009 -rrb- germany calls on us court to reject google book settlement the german government has officially expressed its opposition to plans by internet search giant google to digitize millions of books .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .

google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .

" we are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for an investigative committee set up by russia 's fsb domestic intelligence service , told the interfax news agency .
he said the committee had found fragments of a large bomb at the scene of the luxury train 's crash . fsb head alexsander bortnikov , reporting to russian president dmitry medvedev in a televised meeting , said his investigators estimated the bomb packed the punch of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .
the " nevsky express " was headed to st. petersburg from moscow when the last three cars went off the tracks about 350 kilometers -lrb- 200 miles -rrb- from moscow at 9:34 pm local time -lrb- 6:34 pm utc -rrb- , on friday , november 27 .
661 passengers were on board at the time of the crash .
health minister tatyana golikova said 96 people were injured and being treated in area hospitals .
a loud bang ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 95 survivors of the train wreck have been taken to local hospitals interfax news agency quoted an unnamed security official overnight who said that a crater about one meter -lrb- three feet -rrb- wide had been found near the scene , and that some passengers heard a loud bang before the derailment , prompting speculation about whether the crash was caused by a terrorist act .
russian president dmitry medvedev has been kept informed about the derailment , which has delayed some 27,000 people as transport officials have been scambling to divert trains along other , often slower routes .
the same rail line was targeted in august 2007 , when a bomb derailed a train , injuring 60 passengers .
russian prosecutors believed that an associate of a chechen rebel leader was behind that attack. mrh / svs / reuters / ap / afp editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.11.2009 bulgaria fights uphill battle against trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of trafficking are often sold into prostitution bulgaria has long struggled with corruption that has allowed human trafficking and organized crime to spread beyond its borders .
but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .

rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .

rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .
18 .
many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ambassadors of nine wealthy nations , including germany , have warned hungary that foreign investors could be scared off . last week listeners to hungary 's only two nationwide commercial radio stations suddenly found themselves having to tune into a different channel .
the country 's national broadcasting authority , ortt , had unexpectedly pulled the plug on slager radio and its smaller rival network danubius radio .
their frequencies were given to two broadcasters with close ties to the ruling socialists and the main center-right opposition party fidesz .
ortt president laszlo majtenyi resigned in protest .
shortly before the us-owned slager station went off-air , managing director edina heal told her listeners that authorities had misused their power .
“ dear friends , this is a sad day ” she said .
“ after 12 years slager radio will have to leave .
we will fight this decision because it is fundamentally flawed , and our millions of listeners deserve better . ”
standing firm but the governing socialists and the opposition fidesz party are not impressed by heal 's cries for justice .
they have been uncharacteristically united in defending the decision to ban the station from the airwaves .
fidesz said politicians demanding a parliamentary investigation represent only narrow foreign economic interests .
but that is at odds with data provided by us-based emmis communications which won the broadcasting licence for slager radio in 1997 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's radio listeners are up in arms about the change in broadcasting the company said it invested 170 million dollars in hungary , employed an all-hungarian staff and operated in " a completely transparent and politically non-partisan manner . "
emmis submitted a license-renewal application in late september , promising 11.5 percent of net revenue as a license fee .
danubius radio 's operators pledged 15 percent .
but rivals offering between 50 and 55 percent of revenue won the bids .
media observers , however , believe they will funnel money to political parties rather than putting it into the public purse where it belongs .
the broader picture this is not an isolated case .
earlier this week ambassadors of nine wealthy nations including germany and france met with hungarian prime minister gordon bajnai to express concern about the situation .
he admitted that his country has a transparency problem .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hungary 's prime minister gordon bajnai " i have assured the ambassadors that my government will immediately investigate any complaint relating to foreign investments , ” bajnai said .
the talks followed an open letter from the embassies of the nine countries denouncing " non-transparent behavior affecting investors in such areas as public utilities , broadcasting and elements of the nation 's transport infrastructure . "
western ambassadors have warned hungary that slow progress in curbing corruption could discourage foreign investment at a time when the country , still reeling from the global financial crisis , most needs it .

" we are indeed talking about a terrorist attack , " vladimir markin , a spokesman for an investigative committee set up by russia 's fsb domestic intelligence service , told the interfax news agency .
he said the committee had found fragments of a large bomb at the scene of the luxury train 's crash . fsb head alexsander bortnikov , reporting to russian president dmitry medvedev in a televised meeting , said his investigators estimated the bomb packed the punch of seven kilograms -lrb- 15 lbs . -rrb- of tnt .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 28.11.2009 bulgaria fights uphill battle against trafficking großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims of trafficking are often sold into prostitution bulgaria has long struggled with corruption that has allowed human trafficking and organized crime to spread beyond its borders .
but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .

" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .

she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .

but experts say the police and judiciary are starting to fight these problems . slavery is n't a word that comes to mind as you stroll along sofia 's fashionable boulevards .
but bulgaria has long been a haven for traffickers who target the country 's poorest people , using violence and threats to force their victims into labor , prostitution and crime rings in the west .
according to risk monitor , an ngo working to prevent organized crime and corruption in the country , trafficking may have become more visible with the collapse of communism 20 years ago .
but it has a history that reaches back to the days of the regime .
" during communism in bulgaria , it was impossible to say for ideological reasons that trafficking , exploitation or prostitution was happening - these things were very well hidden by the state , " said iva pushkarova of risk monitor .
" the communist state itself supported the trafficking of human begins - not entirely for sexual exploitation , but for labor . "
when the communist government was ousted in 1989 , organized criminal groups took over the trade in forced human labor .
" these criminal organizations were created by the state during communism , " puskarova said .
" they just separated themselves from the state after the fall of communism . "
lured abroad under false pretences because of her work , pushkarova has become familiar with the stories of many women and girls who have been forced into crime or prostitution by human traffickers - girls like rosaria , who was married off to a man 10 years her elder when she was only 16 . her husband took her to italy , where he said she would work in a restaurant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women do n't know how to escape prostitution " he took me to the owner of a restaurant , and during this meeting , the owner gave my husband a lot of money , " she recalled .
" i did n't understand why .
they said i would live in the restaurant because it was safer than walking home every night .
i was taken to a room and i started to understand i was sold as a prostitute . "
rosaria was not the only bulgarian girl being held captive in the rooms above the restaurant .
she said that when she told the others that she wanted to escape , they told her it was too dangerous .
the owner of the restaurant had the support of the local police .
eventually , one of the girls gave rosaria a pamphlet from an organization which rescues and protects people who have been trafficked .
rosaria hid the pamphlet until she could convince a client to let her use his mobile phone .
two weeks later , the owner of the restaurant found out that the bulgarian police were searching for rosaria , and threw her out .
she found the local police station and returned home to bulgaria .
in many cases , though , it 's not safe for victims to return home after they 've been rescued .
and those who do , often struggle to overcome the trauma they 've experienced , said svetlin markov of animus .
the organization in sofia runs a crisis center , a 24-hour hotline and reintegration programs for survivors .
" we try to help empower women to be more confident about the future , to be more confident in society , and to see that even though they were victims of trafficking in this society , there are individuals who can help , " markov said .
lack of government commitment but markov said that , for the bulgarian government , trafficking simply is n't a priority .
that 's reflected in a lack of funding for animus , meaning the crisis center can only accommodate survivors for one month .
after that , they need to find their own accommodation .
it 's an almost impossible task , as they have no money and there are no shelters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bulgarian government does n't adequately fund anti-corruption programs , critics say " under the anti-trafficking law in bulgaria , the national commissioner is responsible for setting up shelters , but for almost six years , there have n't been any working shelters in bulgaria , " markov said .
" our crisis unit is an exception . "
raising funds to fight trafficking is a difficult task in a country which saw its eu funds stopped last year because of corruption and poor administration .
both markov and pushkarova said funding , improved social policy and education were the keys to preventing trafficking .
" you need to address the roots of the problem and the roots of the problem are social , " pushkarova said .
" they come from being completely uneducated , to being marginalised from society , to being unemployed for a very long time . "
she said that while there 's a long road ahead , there have also been some improvements .
" my research shows that the bulgarian judiciary and police have done an enormous amount of work in the last year , " she said .
" we are on the brink of a great wave of successful court proceedings , and at present , we 're in the midst of social change . "

the tall central defender rose to meet mesut ozil 's corner as the game went into its second minute of injury time , cancelling out wolfsburg 's advantage that had come courtesy of a two-goal effort from edin dzeko .
the bremen players were jubilant .
but after the match , team captain thorsten frings had some criticism .
asked about wolfsburg 's success , frings said , " they have a striker who put in both of their chances . "
it was praise for edin dzeko , but also a little tweak for the likes of bremen 's own striker hugo almeida , who did score in the match , but could have had more .
werder dominated the first half , and it was their failure to convert their chances that had let wolfsburg into the game .
gelsenkirchen club schalke had a chance to overtake werder later on saturday evening when they traveled to mönchengladbach .
but instead , the bundesliga 's youngest team were taught a lesson .
just five minutes into the match , central defender dante picked out juan arango with a 40-meter beauty of a pass that beat schalke 's offside trap .
he passed to marco reus for an easy goal .
gladbach held on for the next 85 minutes and took all three points .
" it appears we did n't know gladbach 's skill at long balls , " said schalke manager felix magath .
" in that decisive moment , our entire back four was caught napping . "
bayer leverkusen has the chance to take back the top spot - but only if it can get a result at home against stuttgart on sunday .
leaving points on the table two of the other sides leading the chase to keep pace with the likes of bremen , hoffenheim and hamburg , will be sorry they could n't hold their opponents in the closing stages of their matches on saturday .
hoffenheim , who had been so dominant in their last string of matches , came out flat in the first half of their home match against dortmund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was dortmund who left hoffenheim happy on saturday they were made to pay for it almost immediately , as jakub “ kuba ” blaszczykowski got on the end of a string of passes in midfield after a hoffenheim giveaway in the second minute .
he pushed the ball past marvin compper and fired a low shot just inside the right post .
hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick made changes at halftime , which seemed to pay off .
demba ba scored in the 49th minute , and the home side had the better of play from then on .
but josip simunic 's clumsy foul of dortmund 's neven subotic in the area in the 78th minute meant a penalty , and then a 2-1 lead , for dortmund .
hoffenheim could n't get one back .
hamburg came into their match against mainz hungry .
they were winless in their last five league games , and had been guilty of allowing a lot of late winners and equalizers during that stretch .
the script did n't flip on saturday , as hamburg protected their third-minute lead for six minutes too few .
mainz 's tim hoogland scored from close range in the 84th after he was set up well by … none other than hamburg defender david rozehnal , whose clearance of a dangerous ball was anything but clean .
" luck just is n't with us at the moment , " said hamburg coach bruno labbadia after the match .
" but there 's no use in complaining , we 'll just have to try and get more out of counter chances like the ones we had in the second half . "
losers lose … or tie each other the current sick man of the bundesliga , hertha berlin , took another bad fall on saturday , losing 3-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt .
it was the team 's 12th loss in 14 matches , and will make very difficult for them to avoid relegation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funkel may now wish he 'd passed on this job " whoever 's been knocked to the floor knows all you can do is try to get up again , " said a drained friedhelm funkel after the match .
the coach who was brought in to rescue hertha in october , but has only seen their free-fall continue .
he said his team looked out of sorts on the pitch from the start .
" of course i 'm disappointed , but we 've got to press on , " he said .
nuremburg , who are also off to a poor start this season , lost again as well , 1-0 at home to freiburg .
the visitors from germany 's far southwest went up after 12 minutes , put the clamps on , and never let up .
two other sides that have been well down in the standings all year , cologne and bochum , faced each other on friday night .
neither managed to score .

jung was serving at the time as germany 's defense minister . the estimated casualty tally of up to 145 people , including dozens of civilians , makes the kunduz attack the deadliest operation involving german troops since world war two . the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - who were junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc before being routed in the september 27 general elections - and the green party have demanded a full investigation of the alleged cover-up scandal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung -lrb- right -rrb- has made things difficult for new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's about more than just the misconduct of a few individual people , " social democratic opposition leader and former foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the hamburger abendblatt newspaper .
" it 's about a basic question of parliamentary democracy .
the people of this country have a right to clarification , " he added .
green party leaders renate kuenast and juergen trittin said they would demand that the events be " comprehensively explained . "
“ we must determine where the structural faults lie , " trittin told the weekly neue presse newspaper .
" the political maneuvering in berlin following the bomb attack is obvious : with the federal election in mind , there was an attempt to deny the reality . ”
" it must be clarified whether the orders for the cover-up came from the then -lrb- defense -rrb- minister or from the chancellor 's office , ” he said .
denial of civilian casualties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of german soldiers in afghanistan could go up next year in the aftermath of the airstrike , jung , a member of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , had repeatedly denied civilians deaths .
on thursday , jung finally admitted he had known for weeks about the existence of a military report that pointed to civilian deaths .
but he said he had no " concrete knowledge " of its contents because it had been passed to nato .
newspapers from across the political spectrum condemned the 60-year-old jung .
one called the affair the first major crisis of merkel 's new center-right administration .
on friday afternoon , jung announced he was stepping down in a terse statement delivered at a hastily called news conference .
" i hereby assume the political responsibility for the internal communication policy of the defense ministry , " he said .
jung 's exit from the post of labor minister came a day after it was announced that germany 's military chief of staff , wolfgang schneiderhan and a former deputy defense minister were stepping down over the airstrike .
awkward timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr mission is becoming increasingly unpopular among the german public the examination of the government 's conduct with regard to the afghan conflict could hardly come at a more awkward time for chancellor angela merkel .
the german parliament is expected next week to renew a mandate which allows merkel 's government to deploy up to 4,500 in the country , but officials have indicated this number could be raised early next year .
with violence reaching its deadliest levels since the taliban were forced from power in 2001 , us president barack obama is set to announce his country 's new strategy for the conflict next week , and is expected to ask european allies for up to 10,000 more troops .
the bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , however , remains highly unpopular in germany. rb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the work should not be handled by the private sector alone . eu ministers meeting in brussels on friday , november 27 , said they wanted to create a bloc-wide project to digitize books , starting with the formation of a committee to work out a blueprint for the plan .
french culture minister frederic mitterrand told french newspaper journal du dimanche that the digital archiving of literature should not be a task solely for private business , and that governments should play a part in any such initiative .
" the committee will be asked to bring together national views and draw up a joint position , " he told the newspaper .
" it 's not up to this or that private group to decide policy on an issue as important as the digitization of our global heritage .
i 'm not going to leave this issue up to simple laissez-faire , " he added .
an expanded european digital library would be an answer to google books , which aims to digitize millions of books and documents from universities and libraries from around the world .
the eu already has a digital library , called europeana , which went live in november 2008 , but the platform has been plagued by a number of technical and usability issues .
charges of stolen heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has paid out millions of dollars during the project european critics have attacked the google project for what they say is the exploitation of the continent 's literary heritage , as well as on antitrust , copyright and privacy grounds .
google has already been taken to court in france over accusations it was illegally reproducing and distributing copyrighted material as part of its project .
in september , german publishers decried the european commission 's lack of action in forcing google to track down copyright holders before digitizing their work .
a hearing in the us has been set for february 18 on a revised legal settlement between google and us authors and publishers that would allow the search engine giant to continue scanning and selling books online .
the revised deal would limit google to digitizing books registered with the us copyright office by january 5 , 2009 , or published in australia , britain , canada or the united states .
the deal has been heavily criticized by organization vg wort , which upholds the rights of authors in germany .
" if the new arrangement proposal is approved it will lead to considerable legal difficulties for german authors and publishing companies , " the body said in a statement after meeting in munich on friday .
it added that many german authors and publishers would be unable to learn for sure whether their books , particularly those published prior to 1978 , were covered under the proposal. dfm / reuters / dpad editor : stephanie siek send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pitch is seen as an attempt to break a political deadlock ahead of key un climate talks beginning dec .
7 . british prime minister gordon brown and french president nicolas sarkozy have separately put forward plans that would see developing nations receive billions of dollars over the next three years to help them tackle climate change .
brown spoke of a $ 10-billion -lrb- 6.7 billion euros -rrb- fund over three years , while sarkozy referred to a deal that would see $ 10 billion a year paid out over three years until 2012 .
the british leader said half of the money should go towards aiding the recipient countries to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases .
the other half would be spent on helping them adapt to the effects of climate change that many scientists believe are already locked in .
build up to copenhagen the so-called copenhagen launch fund , as brown termed it , would amount to a fraction of the estimated sum rich nations will have to pay to developing nations to help them cope with climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown said the summit was a " springboard " for agreeing a climate change deal but with a deadlock between developed and developing countries over just how much money rich countries should pay , the launch fund is being seen as a positive step by industrialized countries to break the impasse .
the standoff has loomed as a possible threat to integral un-backed climate talks to begin in copenhagen on dec .
7 , at which it is hoped a legally binding successor pact to the kyoto protocol can be reached .
the kyoto protocol , which sought to put carbon dioxide emissions limits on signatory states , expires in 2012 .
" i think it is very important that the deadlock is broken , " gordon brown said in a statement issued from a meeting of heads of government of the commonwealth group of nations in trinidad and tobago .
" that means that the poorer countries must have an understanding that the richer countries will help them adapt to climate change and make the necessary adjustments in their economies . "
copenhagen deal " within reach " sarkozy , meanwhile , told reporters at the commonwealth leaders summit that the world " can no longer afford to be unambitious … what is at stake here is the future of our planet . "
the french president was a surprise addition to the summit being held in port-of-spain on the island of trinidad .
un chief ban ki-moon and danish prime minister lars loekke rasmussen also attended the gathering of 53 heads of state representing around two billion people .
" each week brings new commitments and pledges - from industrialized countries , emerging economies and developing countries alike , " ban told the meeting .
" an agreement is within reach ... we must seal a deal in copenhagen . "
more than 85 heads of state have announced their attendance for the copenhagen summit , which is scheduled to run until dec .
18 .
many observers doubt a legally binding treaty for combating climate change will be reached in copenhagen , though momentum has been building in recent weeks towards a broad political framework pact that could see an international climate treaty eventually signed in 2010. dfm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now it is also attracting attention as the home of a world-famous art exhibition . businessman gerard cafesjian , a us-citizen with armenian roots , chose armenia 's capital yerevan over new york and paris when he was looking for a permanent exhibition space for his prominent art collection .
for rather culturally isolated armenia , this project is an important development and could , in the long run , attract tourists from all over the world . cafesjian 's art collection is wide-ranging .
it includes glassware , photography , some chagall paintings , as well as contemporary art from diaspora painters , which have never been on display in armenia before . " the first impression is great , " said abisak zadian , an engineer from yerevan who felt compelled to visit the museum .
" i am shocked by what kind of art one can make from glass - shocked in a good way , i mean .
if there were ten people like cafesjian , who would promote our country like he does , armenia would be full of miracles . " soviet monument becomes art museum cities like paris or new york had also courted cafesjian and his exhibition .
but he had set his sights on yerevan and , in particular , the cascade : a huge white stairwell surrounded by a complex of rooms , courtyards and gardens , built into a slope rising some hundred meters over yerevan . the cascade was originally built as a soviet monument , but decayed after the fall of the ussr .
the word is that cafesjian invested some 30 million euros -lrb- $ 45 million -rrb- in renovating the cascade both inside and outside . " in the whole of the caucasus region there is no art and cultural center like this one , " said ashot gazazyan , a journalist and art expert from yerevan .
" and we will be very happy to welcome tourists here from all over the world , who will then remember armenia in a good way . " after eight years of reconstruction , the art center in the cascade was opened with a blaze of publicity just a couple of weeks ago . however , an additional museum at the top of the hill is still under construction , set to house items like chagall paintings and picasso sculptures .
the building process has almost come to a standstill , with financial problems rumored to be the cause .
some fear the city will be left with a decaying hulk one day , especially since the cafesjian art center has no professional board or endowment . minor difficulties do n't deter " even if gerard cafesjian has problems with local residents or with certain laws , the officials will stand by his side , " said gazazyan .
" i am sure they will do everything to fulfill his demands and wishes .
it is his collection and he should be able to see it just the way he wants to . " like the politicians in yerevan , the museum 's visitors are also willing to compromise .
they ignore the very noisy escalators and the fact that finding their way into the galleries , which are tucked away inside the cascade , can be quite challenging as there are very few signs . for the people of yerevan these are only minor faults .
they are delighted to finally have the chance to become part of the international world of contemporary art . author : mareike aden -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international community is at odds over whether to recognize a new leader . when the honduran army stormed into the presidential palace , kidnapped president manuel zelaya at gunpoint and deposited him abroad , it seemed a throwback to a bygone era , when military coups were all too common in central america . after two decades of democratic rule in the region , zelaya was abruptly replaced by fellow liberal party member roberto micheletti , who has thwarted all attempts supported by the us , other latin american countries and europe to reinstate the president . now , as some 4.6 million hondurans prepare to vote in the presidential election , which was scheduled prior to the june 28th coup and for which neither zelaya nor micheletti is a candidate , the international community remains divided over whether to recognize a new leader if zelaya is not first restored to power . however , on wednesday , honduras ' supreme court ruled his reinstatement unconstitutional . us support for election the us is one of the few countries that has expressed support for sunday 's election , causing friction with zelaya and other latin american leaders who say it would be a victory for those who carried out the coup . " the u.s. position … has divided the americas and is creating a grave precedent , " zelaya told reuters news agency . marco aurelio garcia , a foreign policy advisor to brazilian president luiz inacio lula da silva , has warned the us that it could sour its relations with most of latin america if it recognizes the honduras election . bildunterschrift : ousted president zelaya reads a letter he wrote to us president barack obama however , the obama administration has defended its position , arguing that it is a necessary means to end the political crisis . " we see the running of these elections - assuming that they 're run in a fair and transparent way - we see them as an essential part of the solution of this crisis , " us state department spokesman ian kelly said this week . the ousted president is currently hiding out in the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa , the capital , after sneaking back into the country from costa rica in september . during his term , zelaya had been accused of trying to change the constitution in order to stay in power - a charge he denies .
interim leader roberto micheletti agreed last week to hand power over to his cabinet from november 25th in an effort to increase the election 's legitimacy . looking ahead security is one of the main concerns ahead of sunday 's election , as many people fear the situation could become violent . there 's quite a lot of apprehension in the population about what might happen up until the election , javier zuniga of amnesty international told deutsche welle from honduras . " people have been killed , people have been injured , people have been put in prison , people have been prosecuted , " zuniga said , referring to the post-coup fallout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers seized the national palace and sent zelaya into exile in costa rica the fairness of the election has also been called into question after micheletti temporarily shut down pro-zelaya news channels . porfirio " pepe " lobo of the conservative opposition national party is the leading candidate going into the election .
he and his main opponent , elvin santos of the liberal party , have both tried to avoid mentioning the crisis in their campaigns . germany , along with other members of the european union , refuses to recognize honduras ' interim government and has reduced its aid to the deeply impoverished country .
so far the eu , which is one of the major international donors of the country , has not publicly said whether or not it would recognize the election 's outcome . honduras also was criticized by the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- , which suspended its membership , and along with the un , has refused to send election monitors . even if the election goes ahead as planned without any major incidents it still is unclear how the un , the oas and the eu will deal with the winner of sunday 's vote . author : vanessa johnston editor : michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government says 25 people are known to have died in the derailment , amid speculation that it may have been caused by a bomb blast .
earlier , one official reported that 39 people had died , but that has now been denied by the authorities .
the train , travelling from moscow to st petersburg , crashed on friday night near bologoye town in tver region .
about 90 people were injured as at least three carriages of the express train came off the tracks as it travelled on one of russia 's busiest rail links .
an investigation is under way into the cause of the crash .
a small crater at the scene of the wreck has raised suspicions of sabotage .
" several versions are being considered .
it must be just a pit someone dug out .
or the crater was left by an explosive device , " a law enforcement official was quoted by itar-tass news agency as saying .
some witnesses heard a loud bang before the crash , russian media reports said .
in 2007 , a bomb on the same line derailed a train , injuring nearly 30 passengers .
