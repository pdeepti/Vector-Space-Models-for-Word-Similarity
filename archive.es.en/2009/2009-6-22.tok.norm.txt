he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" what we ask above all is a halt to the violence , that there are no more dead or people attacked in the streets . "

he added that iran was currently considering the expulsion of foreign diplomats .
" the foreign minister will consult today with parliament 's foreign policy commission about the exact dimensions of interference , " he said .
speaking in brussels on monday , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said a summoning of eu ambassadors by tehran would be a sign that they were being heard .
" from that perspective , " he said , it would be " good . "

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .

however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.06.2009 haribo benefits from eu sugar subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu taxpayers help subsidize gummy bears recently , germany became the last european union country to make public a list of those companies and individuals receiving eu agricultural subsidies .
many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" what we ask above all is a halt to the violence , that there are no more dead or people attacked in the streets . "

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

but on monday , the italian news agency , ansa , quoted frattini as saying he did not know what kind of contribution iran could make given its troubled domestic situation .
he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" what we ask above all is a halt to the violence , that there are no more dead or people attacked in the streets . "

" human and civil rights have to be fully respected , " she said .

he added that iran was currently considering the expulsion of foreign diplomats .
" the foreign minister will consult today with parliament 's foreign policy commission about the exact dimensions of interference , " he said .
speaking in brussels on monday , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said a summoning of eu ambassadors by tehran would be a sign that they were being heard .
" from that perspective , " he said , it would be " good . "
bildt , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , also said it was up to tehran to " establish the credibility of their political process .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

it will no longer oppose the practice , media reports said monday . german daily frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper reported that the european union is also changing tack on the matter and now wants to clear the way for the sale of meat and milk from the direct descendants of cloned animals .
the faz quoted an official from brussels as saying a new approach to the matter was necessary to avoid a " regulatory gap " on the future sale and consumption of meat from cloned animals ' offspring .
the eu is now expected to move ahead with formulating new regulations on cloned meat , and also on foods altered with nanotechnology , faz said .
a european commission working group for ethical science and new technologies had found that there were no convincing arguments for using meat from cloned animals or their offspring .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

the federal financial supervisory authority , bafin , said monday it had received a letter from iceland 's economy minister , on behalf of the reykjavik government , stating that the deposits in the german branch of kaupthing , met with icelandic and eu regulations .
around 20,000 private investors of the partly nationalized bank will finally be able to withdraw their savings , totaling 308 million euros -lrb- $ 427 million -rrb- , in the next few days from the bank with the remaining customers having to wait a few more weeks .
the question of interest accumulated in the last eight months will be cleared up at a later stage .
on october 9 2008 the bonn-based authority issued a stoppage of disposals and payments for the german branch of kaupthing bank .
at the time bafin said it wanted to secure the branch 's still remaining assets .
financial crisis the former icelandic government introduced emergency legislation with wideranging powers to battle the trouble at icelandic financial sector .
iceland 's then prime minister geir h. haarde had said that the unrest on global financial markets was posing a grave threat to icelandic banking system as whole .
faced with imminent financial ruin the icelandic parent company kaupthing blocked access to the online accounts of its branch in germany after being placed under the control of iceland ’ s financial supervisory authority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will kaupthing become a bad bank ?
one issue remains unresolved however .
kaupthing is still in a clinch with dz bank , which is withholding repayment of 55 million euros , which the islanders " parked " with the german central bank at the height of the banking crisis .
dz bank first wants to file a claim against the icelandic bank before freeing up the deposits , which had been intended as reimbursement for kaupthing depositors. nrt / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 22.06.2009 somalia appeals for help in fighting insurgents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : insurgents are trying to overthrow the government authorities in somalia have warned that insurgents are about to take control of the country .
the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

"
with reference to the disputed june 12th iranian elections , which have led to days of violent unrest in the capital , tehran , netanyahu said he was in " no doubt " that the people of iran would elect a different government if allowed to vote freely .
netanyahu 's comments came ahead of a planned trip to italy and france this week , his first to europe since taking office three months ago .
" i think the true nature of the iranian regime has been unmasked , " he told the newspaper .
" what we have seen in iran is a powerful desire on the part of the iranian people to be free . "
he said that the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad – who called the holocaust a " great deception " and said israel should be wiped off the map – was a threat for israel , for moderate arab countries , european security and world peace. tkw / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .

he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will no longer oppose the practice , media reports said monday . german daily frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper reported that the european union is also changing tack on the matter and now wants to clear the way for the sale of meat and milk from the direct descendants of cloned animals .
the faz quoted an official from brussels as saying a new approach to the matter was necessary to avoid a " regulatory gap " on the future sale and consumption of meat from cloned animals ' offspring .
the eu is now expected to move ahead with formulating new regulations on cloned meat , and also on foods altered with nanotechnology , faz said .
a european commission working group for ethical science and new technologies had found that there were no convincing arguments for using meat from cloned animals or their offspring .
the german farmers association has been the strongest voice against cloned meat from within the country , influencing berlin 's prior stance against it .
the german government has said in the past that cloned meat would not be sold in supermarkets .
the subject of cloned meat is expected to come up at a meeting monday of european union agriculture ministers. dfm / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.06.2009 eu ministers approve sale of food from cloned animals ' offspring großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it cloned ?
scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .

" the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .

" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.06.2009 beyond beer and bratwurst : germany markets itself in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more to offer , says the image campaign in china beer and cars are the first things that come to mind when people in china think of germany .
but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .

an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" an attempt was carried out on the life of president yevkurov , " a spokesman for the leader said .
" he is currently in a serious condition . "
russian president , dmitry medvedev has condemned the attack on the man he appointed to lead the troubled republic at the end of last year .

he said " the bandits did not like this activity . "
suicide bombing an unnamed police official said the explosion was the work of a suicide bomber who drove into the presidential convoy .
the attempt on yevkurov 's life is the latest in a string of high-profile attacks that have killed a former deputy prime minister and a senior judge within the past weeks .
ingushetia is a predominantly muslim region , which has been fighting an islamic insurgency for the past years .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .

"
with reference to the disputed june 12th iranian elections , which have led to days of violent unrest in the capital , tehran , netanyahu said he was in " no doubt " that the people of iran would elect a different government if allowed to vote freely .
netanyahu 's comments came ahead of a planned trip to italy and france this week , his first to europe since taking office three months ago .
" i think the true nature of the iranian regime has been unmasked , " he told the newspaper .
" what we have seen in iran is a powerful desire on the part of the iranian people to be free . "
he said that the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad – who called the holocaust a " great deception " and said israel should be wiped off the map – was a threat for israel , for moderate arab countries , european security and world peace. tkw / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with reference to the disputed june 12th iranian elections , which have led to days of violent unrest in the capital , tehran , netanyahu said he was in " no doubt " that the people of iran would elect a different government if allowed to vote freely .
netanyahu 's comments came ahead of a planned trip to italy and france this week , his first to europe since taking office three months ago .
" i think the true nature of the iranian regime has been unmasked , " he told the newspaper .
" what we have seen in iran is a powerful desire on the part of the iranian people to be free . "
he said that the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad – who called the holocaust a " great deception " and said israel should be wiped off the map – was a threat for israel , for moderate arab countries , european security and world peace. tkw / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.06.2009 lukashenko pursues old tactics , not new strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between lukashenko , right , and putin are strained despite overtures to the eu and a recent row with russia , belarus is n't going to turn away from its big neighbor any time soon .
instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

"
but a spokesman for iranian foreign minister , manouchehr mottaki said the decision would not be made until friday , which is the end of the iranian week . italy , current holder of the g8 presidency , invited iran to attend the meeting which will focus on ways to improve stability in afghanistan and pakistan .
but on monday , the italian news agency , ansa , quoted frattini as saying he did not know what kind of contribution iran could make given its troubled domestic situation .
he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
" what we ask above all is a halt to the violence , that there are no more dead or people attacked in the streets . "
calls for election review frattini also echoed german chancellor angela merkel 's urgings for a review of the disputed presidential elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is seeking clarification from tehran in a statement on sunday , merkel called for a recount .
she said germany " is on the side of the people of iran who want to exercise their right to freedom of expression and free assembly . "
she also appealed to the leadership in iran to permit peaceful demonstrations , refrain from using force against protestors and release imprisoned opposition figures .
" human and civil rights have to be fully respected , " she said .
for its part , the iranian government has said it is reviewing relations with germany , france , britain and the united states over their stance towards the contested presidential elections .
a german foreign ministry spokesman said on monday that berlin had ' invited ' , but not summoned , iran 's ambassador to clarify the statements .
press restrictions meanwhile the eu foreign policy chief , javier solana has criticized iran 's attempts to muzzle journalists working there .
speaking in response to the expulsion of the bbc 's permanent correspondent in tehran and the detention of other reporters , solana said it was " not something we can accept . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden 's foreign minister wants the eu to be heard in iran on monday , spokesman for iran 's foreign ministry , hassan ghashghavi blamed the bbc and voice of america for the unrest in tehran .
he said their aim was to " weaken national solidarity , threaten territorial integrity and disintegrate iran . "
he added that iran was currently considering the expulsion of foreign diplomats .
" the foreign minister will consult today with parliament 's foreign policy commission about the exact dimensions of interference , " he said .
speaking in brussels on monday , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said a summoning of eu ambassadors by tehran would be a sign that they were being heard .
" from that perspective , " he said , it would be " good . "
bildt , whose country takes over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , also said it was up to tehran to " establish the credibility of their political process .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .

haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .

pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as unrest continues following recent presidential elections , iran continues to clamp down on foreign correspondents . filmmaker and journalist maziar bahari , who has filed reports for newsweek , has not been heard from since being detained on sunday morning .
" newsweek strongly condemns this unwarranted detention , and calls upon the iranian government to release him immediately , " a statement released by the magazine said .
bahari is a canadian citizen and has been reporting from iran for the last 10 years .
iranian authorities also ordered a bbc correrspondent to leave the country within 24 hours .
western media 's ability to cover the events in iran have been severely hampered by restrictions placed on them by iranian authorities .
since the election results were announced , more than 20 journalists and bloggers attempting to cover the disputed results have been detained .
world leaders have called on the iranian government to allow journalists to do their job .
" the attitude of the tehran authorities in the face of the legitimate desire for truth of a large part of the iranian population is inexcusable , " french president nicolas sarkozy said .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .

but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick .

he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .

he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .
after malta , sweden , the netherlands and britain are still home to the safest roads in the eu , but switzerland , norway and germany , notorious for its fast autobahn highways , are catching up. tkw / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission ruled that " the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it .
" the comprehensive remedies package offered by lufthansa will facilitate market entry on the affected routes and thereby create alternative choices for passengers , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
the takeover was paused and scheduled for further scrutiny earlier this year over fears the deal could see the creation of a monopoly on several key european routes - from brussels to frankfurt , munich , hamburg and zurich respectively .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

the commission ruled that " the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it .
" the comprehensive remedies package offered by lufthansa will facilitate market entry on the affected routes and thereby create alternative choices for passengers , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
the takeover was paused and scheduled for further scrutiny earlier this year over fears the deal could see the creation of a monopoly on several key european routes - from brussels to frankfurt , munich , hamburg and zurich respectively .
lufthansa is to pay 65 million euros to buy 45 percent of the belgian carrier , and has an option to buy the rest of the business in 2011 .
another potential lufthansa takeover - of austrian airlines - is still under investigation by the commission , which has until july 1 to either approve the deal or initiate a more comprehensive study of the plan. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .

the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.06.2009 french president criticizes the burqa in wide-ranging speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , laid out his vision for the future in a wide-ranging speech before both chambers of parliament , french president nicolas sarkozy condemned the wearing of the burqa in french society , and spoke of economic measures he would pursue to help france . " the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.06.2009 lukashenko pursues old tactics , not new strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between lukashenko , right , and putin are strained despite overtures to the eu and a recent row with russia , belarus is n't going to turn away from its big neighbor any time soon .
instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite disappointing european polls , the left hopes the economic recession will discredit mainstream politics . " if the left is weakened in the election , there will be no stopping the neo-liberal bloc , " party chief oskar lafontaine told some 500 delegates at his party 's congress in berlin on sunday . september 's bundestag parliamentary vote will be crucial for the left party and lafontaine 's goal of thwarting chancellor angela merkel 's stated aim of forming a center-right government with the liberal free democrats , who are currently in opposition . lafontaine - a former social democrat and finance minister under former chancellor gerhard schroeder in the late nineties - said the left party would stick with its target of reaching more than 10 percent of the vote . it had set the same ambitious target for the european parliamentary polls earlier in the month , but the party was handed a bitter disappointment , winning merely 7.5 percent . the weak showing in the european poll triggered finger-pointing within the party and led to some criticism of lafontaine 's dominant role in party politics . influencing the next government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left hopes to win more than 10 percent of the votes in the parliamentary poll lafontaine said that even if other parties refused to form a coalition with the left , his alliance of ex-communists from former east germany and western leftists could still play an important role in influencing both the shape and policies of the next government . " only a strong left can prevent a worsening of conditions for workers , pensioners and social welfare recipients , " he said . with higher taxes , lafontaine 's party wants to finance a 200-billion-euro -lrb- $ 280 billion -rrb- stimulus fund to help those who have been hit the hardest by the economic crisis . on the foreign policy front , the party has called for an immediate withdrawal of german troops from afghanistan and for a replacement of nato with a new european security system that would include russia . bildunterschrift : delegates voted in favor of the party 's election manifesto destruction of democracy yet the main attacks at the weekend party congress were focused on the social and economic situation within germany . " financial capitalism is destroying democracy , " lafontaine said .
" we 've got a vision .
we want a ' free people ' economy .
we want a redistribution of the burdens . " lafontaine said those who had profited from financial capitalism in recent boom years should pay for the effects of the economic crisis , which has pushed germany , europe 's largest economy , into recession . the left is currently polling between eight and 11 percent in opinion surveys . ai / ipj / dpa / apf / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .

madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .

somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .

as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

as unrest continues following recent presidential elections , iran continues to clamp down on foreign correspondents . filmmaker and journalist maziar bahari , who has filed reports for newsweek , has not been heard from since being detained on sunday morning .
" newsweek strongly condemns this unwarranted detention , and calls upon the iranian government to release him immediately , " a statement released by the magazine said .
bahari is a canadian citizen and has been reporting from iran for the last 10 years .
iranian authorities also ordered a bbc correrspondent to leave the country within 24 hours .
western media 's ability to cover the events in iran have been severely hampered by restrictions placed on them by iranian authorities .
since the election results were announced , more than 20 journalists and bloggers attempting to cover the disputed results have been detained .
world leaders have called on the iranian government to allow journalists to do their job .
" the attitude of the tehran authorities in the face of the legitimate desire for truth of a large part of the iranian population is inexcusable , " french president nicolas sarkozy said .
iranian authorities have blamed the foreign media in the united states , britain and other countries for the unrest .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .

dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .

the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .

" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .

instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .

now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .

but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .
ifo 's head of industry research , dr. gernot nerb , said the index only measured expectations , but that it was a positive sign .
“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 22.06.2009 europe faces long road in improving traffic safety großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european roads have a heavy load to carry new statistics show a drop in the number of people killed in road traffic accidents across the european union .
but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling global demand has taken a chunk out germany 's export earnings .
based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .

lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .

his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .

some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls .

the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

as unrest continues following recent presidential elections , iran continues to clamp down on foreign correspondents . filmmaker and journalist maziar bahari , who has filed reports for newsweek , has not been heard from since being detained on sunday morning .
" newsweek strongly condemns this unwarranted detention , and calls upon the iranian government to release him immediately , " a statement released by the magazine said .
bahari is a canadian citizen and has been reporting from iran for the last 10 years .
iranian authorities also ordered a bbc correrspondent to leave the country within 24 hours .
western media 's ability to cover the events in iran have been severely hampered by restrictions placed on them by iranian authorities .
since the election results were announced , more than 20 journalists and bloggers attempting to cover the disputed results have been detained .
world leaders have called on the iranian government to allow journalists to do their job .
" the attitude of the tehran authorities in the face of the legitimate desire for truth of a large part of the iranian population is inexcusable , " french president nicolas sarkozy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 22.06.2009 europe faces long road in improving traffic safety großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european roads have a heavy load to carry new statistics show a drop in the number of people killed in road traffic accidents across the european union .
but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .
after malta , sweden , the netherlands and britain are still home to the safest roads in the eu , but switzerland , norway and germany , notorious for its fast autobahn highways , are catching up. tkw / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .

it will no longer oppose the practice , media reports said monday . german daily frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper reported that the european union is also changing tack on the matter and now wants to clear the way for the sale of meat and milk from the direct descendants of cloned animals .
the faz quoted an official from brussels as saying a new approach to the matter was necessary to avoid a " regulatory gap " on the future sale and consumption of meat from cloned animals ' offspring .
the eu is now expected to move ahead with formulating new regulations on cloned meat , and also on foods altered with nanotechnology , faz said .
a european commission working group for ethical science and new technologies had found that there were no convincing arguments for using meat from cloned animals or their offspring .
the german farmers association has been the strongest voice against cloned meat from within the country , influencing berlin 's prior stance against it .
the german government has said in the past that cloned meat would not be sold in supermarkets .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
with reference to the disputed june 12th iranian elections , which have led to days of violent unrest in the capital , tehran , netanyahu said he was in " no doubt " that the people of iran would elect a different government if allowed to vote freely .
netanyahu 's comments came ahead of a planned trip to italy and france this week , his first to europe since taking office three months ago .
" i think the true nature of the iranian regime has been unmasked , " he told the newspaper .
" what we have seen in iran is a powerful desire on the part of the iranian people to be free . "
he said that the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad – who called the holocaust a " great deception " and said israel should be wiped off the map – was a threat for israel , for moderate arab countries , european security and world peace. tkw / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission ruled that " the proposed transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the european economic area or any substantial part of it .
" the comprehensive remedies package offered by lufthansa will facilitate market entry on the affected routes and thereby create alternative choices for passengers , " said eu competition commissioner neelie kroes .
the takeover was paused and scheduled for further scrutiny earlier this year over fears the deal could see the creation of a monopoly on several key european routes - from brussels to frankfurt , munich , hamburg and zurich respectively .
lufthansa is to pay 65 million euros to buy 45 percent of the belgian carrier , and has an option to buy the rest of the business in 2011 .
another potential lufthansa takeover - of austrian airlines - is still under investigation by the commission , which has until july 1 to either approve the deal or initiate a more comprehensive study of the plan. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.06.2009 beyond beer and bratwurst : germany markets itself in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more to offer , says the image campaign in china beer and cars are the first things that come to mind when people in china think of germany .
but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick . " afterwards , if the people have a more positive impression of germany , that 's not bad , " said kahn-ackermann . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.06.2009 french president criticizes the burqa in wide-ranging speech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy , left , laid out his vision for the future in a wide-ranging speech before both chambers of parliament , french president nicolas sarkozy condemned the wearing of the burqa in french society , and spoke of economic measures he would pursue to help france . " the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.06.2009 lukashenko pursues old tactics , not new strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between lukashenko , right , and putin are strained despite overtures to the eu and a recent row with russia , belarus is n't going to turn away from its big neighbor any time soon .
instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .
killing for killing .
that is not a political agenda , " said the african union 's special envoy to somalia , nicholas bwakira .
fighters come from all over the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mogadishu has put out a call for military assitance the insurgents have been recruiting fighters from africa , from america , bwakira said .
" therefore we are sending a signal to the international community that these threats to peace and stability is a challenge and a threat to international peace and stability , " he said .
somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .
the unpredictable and unstable situation in somalia has prompted neighboring kenya to tighten security along its porous border with the horn of africa nation .
moses wetangula kenya 's foreign affairs minister has confirmed that kenya has increased security measures along it 's border with somalia .
" the government and the people of kenya will make sure that the unfolding events in somalia do not in any way undermine or affect our peace and security as a country , " said wetangula .
as kenya stepped up its security , al-shabab insurgents threatened to attack kenya accusing it of amassing troops at its border with somalia .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .

“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .

it will no longer oppose the practice , media reports said monday . german daily frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper reported that the european union is also changing tack on the matter and now wants to clear the way for the sale of meat and milk from the direct descendants of cloned animals .
the faz quoted an official from brussels as saying a new approach to the matter was necessary to avoid a " regulatory gap " on the future sale and consumption of meat from cloned animals ' offspring .
the eu is now expected to move ahead with formulating new regulations on cloned meat , and also on foods altered with nanotechnology , faz said .
a european commission working group for ethical science and new technologies had found that there were no convincing arguments for using meat from cloned animals or their offspring .
the german farmers association has been the strongest voice against cloned meat from within the country , influencing berlin 's prior stance against it .
the german government has said in the past that cloned meat would not be sold in supermarkets .
the subject of cloned meat is expected to come up at a meeting monday of european union agriculture ministers. dfm / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with reference to the disputed june 12th iranian elections , which have led to days of violent unrest in the capital , tehran , netanyahu said he was in " no doubt " that the people of iran would elect a different government if allowed to vote freely .
netanyahu 's comments came ahead of a planned trip to italy and france this week , his first to europe since taking office three months ago .
" i think the true nature of the iranian regime has been unmasked , " he told the newspaper .
" what we have seen in iran is a powerful desire on the part of the iranian people to be free . "
he said that the regime of president mahmoud ahmadinejad – who called the holocaust a " great deception " and said israel should be wiped off the map – was a threat for israel , for moderate arab countries , european security and world peace. tkw / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .

he said it was " simply a matter of being concrete and pragmatic . "
he joined in the international choir calling for iran to stop the crackdown against demonstrators protesting the re-election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .

instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .
also pointing to the small amount of scientific research on the topic , the group said food products from cloned animals and their offspring should not be sold until all possible consequences of consuming it have been analyzed . the european parliament has also criticized plans to sell the meat and milk of cloned animals ' progeny .
the body 's most recent position on the issue came in march , when it opposed the sale of such products . peter liese , a german member of the european parliament , told reporters monday that the agriculture ministers ' decision was " not the last word " on the issue , adding that the parliament was against the cloning of animals for food production . while food from cloned animals is not necessarily harmful to humans ' health , " its risks also can not be ruled out , " he said . german agriculture minister ilse aigner has called for the eu to analyze the ethical dimensions of selling food from progeny of cloned animals in a year 's time , a demand also made by the german farmers association .
but further discussions are likely as not all eu members are in favor of such a study . labeling requirements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone is convinced that milk from cloned cows is safe to drink the consumer rights group foodwatch also called for a study examining the ethical dimensions of cloning animals .
the group wants regulations requiring any food products from cloned animals or their offspring to be clearly labeled . " people should be have the right to refuse cloned meat and fish for any reason , " foodwatch head matthias wolfschmnidt told reporters .
" if cloned meat is in something , then the label has to say so . " the united states was the first country to allow the sale of meat and milk from cloned cattle , swine and goats .
the us food and drug administration approved the products for human consumption in 2008 and does not require that they be specially labeled . despite the debate raging in the european union , germany 's deputy agriculture minister gert lindemann said he does n't expect many foods from cloned animals to be landing on tables . " at the moment , a cloned animals costs about 50 times as much as a non-cloned animal , " he said . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

iranian authorities also ordered a bbc correrspondent to leave the country within 24 hours .
western media 's ability to cover the events in iran have been severely hampered by restrictions placed on them by iranian authorities .
since the election results were announced , more than 20 journalists and bloggers attempting to cover the disputed results have been detained .

" the attitude of the tehran authorities in the face of the legitimate desire for truth of a large part of the iranian population is inexcusable , " french president nicolas sarkozy said .

scientists say it 's impossible to tell milk and meat from the progeny of cloned animals could soon be hitting the shelves of european supermarkets .
some groups have been critical of such products , which are already on sale in the united states . european agriculture ministers approved the sale of milk and meat from the direct offspring of cloned animals on monday .
germany had long opposed the move , but finally changed its position . according to monday 's decision , food products originating from the progeny of cloned animals will still have to receive approval by the european food safety authority before they can be sold in the eu .
the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals themselves , however , is not permitted . no scientific differences a scientific committee set up by the efsa came to the conclusion in a july 2008 report that there were no convincing arguments against permitting the sale of food products from cloned animals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cloned animals would be subject to the same eu controls as other animals " there is no indication that differences exist in terms of food safety for meat and milk of clones and their progeny compared with those from conventionally bred animals , " the efsa report said .
" such a conclusion is based on the assumption that meat and milk are derived from healthy animals , which are subject to relevant food safety controls . " the authority , however , also said there were uncertainties in the risk assessment of food from cloned animals due to the limited number of studies available and the small sample sizes investigated . ethical dilemma germany 's farmers association has come out against the sale of food products from cloned animals or their offspring .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .
after malta , sweden , the netherlands and britain are still home to the safest roads in the eu , but switzerland , norway and germany , notorious for its fast autobahn highways , are catching up. tkw / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will no longer oppose the practice , media reports said monday . german daily frankfurter allgemeinen zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper reported that the european union is also changing tack on the matter and now wants to clear the way for the sale of meat and milk from the direct descendants of cloned animals .
the faz quoted an official from brussels as saying a new approach to the matter was necessary to avoid a " regulatory gap " on the future sale and consumption of meat from cloned animals ' offspring .
the eu is now expected to move ahead with formulating new regulations on cloned meat , and also on foods altered with nanotechnology , faz said .
a european commission working group for ethical science and new technologies had found that there were no convincing arguments for using meat from cloned animals or their offspring .
the german farmers association has been the strongest voice against cloned meat from within the country , influencing berlin 's prior stance against it .
the german government has said in the past that cloned meat would not be sold in supermarkets .
the subject of cloned meat is expected to come up at a meeting monday of european union agriculture ministers. dfm / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the takeover was paused and scheduled for further scrutiny earlier this year over fears the deal could see the creation of a monopoly on several key european routes - from brussels to frankfurt , munich , hamburg and zurich respectively .
lufthansa is to pay 65 million euros to buy 45 percent of the belgian carrier , and has an option to buy the rest of the business in 2011 .
another potential lufthansa takeover - of austrian airlines - is still under investigation by the commission , which has until july 1 to either approve the deal or initiate a more comprehensive study of the plan. dfm / afp / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .
after malta , sweden , the netherlands and britain are still home to the safest roads in the eu , but switzerland , norway and germany , notorious for its fast autobahn highways , are catching up. tkw / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government has declared a state of emergency and is appealing for urgent military help from neighboring countries . the dramatic appeal for urgent military help was made in the capital mogadishu by parliamentary speaker sheik aden mohammed noor madobe .
he said that increasing attacks have weakened the government .
" our forces can no longer withstand al-qaida-backed insurgents .
we need urgent military help from ethiopia , djibouti , kenya and yemen in the next 24 hours , " madobe said .
so far , the four countries have not responded to madobe 's appeal .
madobe made it clear that al-qaida fighters were fighting alongside the country 's al-shabab islamist insurgents .
the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .
the only thing that they have achieved is to kill .

somalia 's minister of planning and international cooperation , abdul rahman warsame , says that the foreign fighters are a threat not only to the lawless country , but to the region .
" most of them are killing muslim and arab born .
those people are threats to the somali government , are threats to the neighboring countries , are threats to international security and my government alone can not stand against them , " said warsame .

but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 22.06.2009 beyond beer and bratwurst : germany markets itself in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has more to offer , says the image campaign in china beer and cars are the first things that come to mind when people in china think of germany .
but a new national image campaign is out to change that . there 's never been anything like it in the 6-million strong city of shenyang : a huge open-air festival in zhongshan park , where retirees typically come to do their quiet tai qi exercises . instead , thousands of young people sway to the music of a different german band each evening .
the park concerts are part of a project called " germany and china move together . "
it was launched in the southern chinese city of nanjing in 2007 and is one its way through five additional cities until 2010 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hope the festival will lead to better cultural understanding for 10 days , shenyang is getting a taste of german culture , beyond the usual stereotypes of lederhosen , beer and brass bands .
here , germany wants to present itself as the " country of ideas , " innovation and green technology . but the campaign 's message goes beyond boosting germany 's image in china , said project organizer michael kahn-ackermann from the goethe institute in beijing . " we 're faced with tasks that a single country , even one as big and strong and confident as china or as high-tech as germany , wo n't be able to solve alone , " he said .
" the message is simple : ' let us start to learn how we can successfully work together . " ' corporate contribution for germany , the attempt to promote its ideas , values and visions in china through " soft power " does n't come cheap .
the events in shenyang alone are slated to cost 2.3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- , two-thirds of which are coming from public funds . the rest is sponsored by large german firms , which are there presenting their concepts for a greener future - and , of course - their products . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german firms used the festival to show off green products like this electric smart car with pop music coming from the stage outside , siemens promotes its energy-saving light bulbs , bosch displays its earth-friendly washing machines and basf presents its insulation material inside the covered pavilions . the organizers insist that advertising is n't the focal point of the event .
still , a young salesman at the daimler pavilion was encouraged by the large crowd .
an electric smart car outside the tent was attracting visitors . " it 's about sustainability here ; it 's not a sales show in the typical sense , " he said . stereotypes hard to break but the visitors did n't just come to shop .
everything that 's perceived as traditionally german proves to be a big hit . the hurdy-gurdy man plays for a large group of school kids , and women dressed in traditional black forest costumes are busy posing for photographs with visitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some things are easier to get a grip on than sustainable industrial policy while enjoying bratwurst and beer in the beer garden , the guests did n't hesitate when asked what they associate with germany : " cars , " " beer , " and " technology " were the quick answers . the scheduled discussions on topics including ecological farming , sustainable industrial policy , and waste management and recycling did n't resonate quite as well with the visitors . " for us simple people , it 's all too far away , " said a 44-year-old man , who had brought his daughter along .
" we do n't know much about that stuff . " nevertheless , the project organizers hope that the image of an innovative and different kind of germany will stick .

the past two weeks have seen the insurgents use suicide bombers to kill somali cabinet ministers and top government officials .
" the shabab have no objective .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .
france is under pressure to rein in its public deficit , which is set to top seven percent of gross domestic product this year and next , more than twice the limit allowed by the european union. gb / afp / ap / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but there is still a long way to go towards making eu roads safer for those who travel them . figures released by the european transport safety council -lrb- etsc -rrb- show that 38,000 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in 2008 .
although that figure is down 15,400 since 2001 , it is still miles away from the 27,000 deaths target which the eu set itself for 2010 .
in order to now reach that reduced figure , there would need to be a 17 percent annual reduction in deaths on europe 's highways and byways both in 2009 and 2010 .
and that is just not realistic , experts say .
in an etsc press release , the body 's executive director antonio avenoso said the eu should come up with a new program for better road safety in the next decade .
“ new targets must be set for 2020 which will mobilise action at a joint european level , ” he said , adding that “ more eu instruments , like structural funds for transport ” should be used to further reduce the numbers of deaths and disabilities resulting from accidents on european roads .
the good and the bad of eu roads bildunterschrift : crashes are an too familiar a sight on european highways countries which achieved the highest rates of accident reduction included estonia and lithuania , each of which saw a 33 percent decrease .
slovenia and latvia revealed drops of 27 and 25 percent respectively .
but the report partially attributed the falling figures in the baltic states to a reduction in traffic volume in the face of recession and high fuel costs . poland and slovakia showed little progress , while in both romania and bulgaria , the death tolls were higher in 2008 than back in 2001 .
after malta , sweden , the netherlands and britain are still home to the safest roads in the eu , but switzerland , norway and germany , notorious for its fast autobahn highways , are catching up. tkw / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services .

many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .

haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

" the problem of the burqa is not a religious problem ; it is a problem of the dignity of women .
it is a symbol of subservience , of submission , " sarkozy said .
france , home to an estimated five million muslims , passed a law in 2004 banning headscarves or other conspicuous religious symbols in public schools .
the french president made his comments during a major policy speech on a wide range of issues before the joint session of the national assembly in the palace of versailles .
it was the first time a french head of state addressed lawmakers in 150 years .
the last leader to do so was charles-louis napoleon in 1848 .
sarkozy 's appearance was made possible by an amendment to the french constitution in 2008 , which had banned sitting presidents from addressing lawmakers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy called the burqa a symbol of subservience sarkozy 's comments on the burqa come on the heels of a resolution , introduced in the national assembly last week and supported now by 80 legislators , calling for the creation of a parliamentary committee to examine the wearing of burqas on french territory .
there are no official figures , but several thousand women are believed to wear the garment in france .
economic kick-start vow if the president sounded like a left-wing social reformer in the first part of his address , with his defense of women 's rights , his call for equality and a vow to improve prison conditions , he later turned to two of his favorite subjects : the reduction of public spending and the reform of the country 's bureaucracy .
however , sarkozy ruled out tough austerity measures in the wake of the global financial crisis and pledged instead to take out a new government loan to help france out of its economic doldrums .
he also promised not to raise taxes , which he argued would only delay the country 's recovery .
sarkozy said the current crisis highlighted the virtues of france 's traditional policies of strong public investment and generous social spending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was the first president to address both houses of parliament in 150 years he said the government would launch a three-month consultation period on july 1 with lawmakers , labor leaders , business executives and the cultural establishment to flesh out key areas for investment .
he said decisions would only be made after that debate .
sarkozy also said that the question of pension reform would be tackled in 2010 , including a possible increase in the retirement age .
he also pledged to continue reducing the number of civil servants by replacing only one of two retiring public sector workers .

the business index , released by the institute for economic research in munich , is seen as a major indicator of the economic mood in europe .

“ expectations have been improving now for more than six months and this signals that the worst might be over , ” he said .

based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the index has risen steadily since bottoming out at a 26-year-low in march , amid fears about the fallout from the steep global economic downturn .
the ifo has gained ground on hopes that a string of big government fiscal stimulus packages and hefty interest rate cuts around the world would open the way for an economic pickup into 2010 .
earlier this month german investor confidence jumped to a three-year high , a key indicator released last tuesday showed .
the centre for european economic research -lrb- zew -rrb- said its index measuring the mood among institutional investors posted its eighth consecutive monthly rise , surpassing forecasts to reach 44.8 points in june .
german economy will shrink further despite that , forecasters say the german economy will shrink by 6 per cent or more this year , dragged down by falling exports as a sharp drop in global trade undercuts foreign orders for the world 's biggest exporting nation .
that means things will get worse before they get better on the employmern front .
dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

dr nerb said that despite the continuing upward trend , it would take at least 6 to 9 months before there was an improvement in the labor market .
“ the labor market is always lagging .
when demand picks up and turnover starts to improve then companies are reluctant to hire additional staff because there 's so much slack in the companies , ” he said .
“ it 's only in later stages when the upswing picks up more momentum that they start to hire additional staff and this will not be before spring next year . ”
the picture may become clearer later this week , when a new round of monthly sentiment surveys is due out .
this includes german and french consumer confidence reports as well as belgium 's business sentiment indicator , which is considered to be a bellwether survey for the 16-member eurozone .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

" i think now is the time for a period of reflection in both countries .
this is a bilateral dispute , " he said , adding it was primarily up to slovenia and croatia to resolve the row , which dates back to the 1991 break-up of yugoslavia .
last week an eu mediation bid to resolve a land-and-sea border dispute between croatia and eu member slovenia collapsed .
croatia applied for european union membership in 2003 , and the european commission recommended making it an official candidate in early 2004 .
after the irish referendum , german chancellor angela merkel said in june 2008 that the eu will not expand beyond 27 states without reform of the current treaty of nice rules even though the treaty allows for such an enlargement .
meanwhile , the swedish foreign minister has offered iceland the chance of a fast-track eu memberships - obviously one nation 's misfortune is another 's gain .
bildt said there were only a " few points " which have to be settled. nrt / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 22.06.2009 haribo benefits from eu sugar subsidies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu taxpayers help subsidize gummy bears recently , germany became the last european union country to make public a list of those companies and individuals receiving eu agricultural subsidies .
many were surprised to see haribo , the gummy bear maker , on the list . at haribo factories in 18 different locations in europe , including the one in bonn , germany , glucose syrup , sugar and fruit flavoring are transformed into chewy frogs , juicy berries , and the classic haribo gummy bears .
the recipe is a secret , but a representative company admitted that they do use a lot of sugar , the second ingredient in their gummy sweets .
recently , trucks were coming and going from the haribo factory in bonn , bringing ingredients in and sending finished gummies out into the world .
one of the trucks making a delivery is from koelner zucker , a sugar company based in cologne , just north of bonn .
the majority of the sugar haribo uses comes from europe .
to keep cheap , non-eu sugar from flooding the european market and putting european sugar producers out of business , the eu sets sugar prices and taxes sugar imports .
that makes eu sugar more expensive than sugar bought on the world market .
making up the difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is protective of its sugar beet farmers this creates a problem for companies like haribo that do business internationally .
to support firms exporting to non-eu countries , ulrich preusser , head of haribo 's legal department , said that the eu provides so-called export refunds .
" we get the price difference between the sugar price in the eu and world market price , " said preusser .
" we get this money only for our goods we sell to non-eu countries and it 's only because we are in competition there with producers who can produce outside the eu and who can buy their sugar at the world market price . "
haribo gummy bears , one of germany 's most successful exports , are beloved around the world .
in fact , 100 million bears are produced every day and the majority of them are bound for haribo fans outside of germany .
pruesser says haribo would rather pay competitive prices for their sugar , but until the eu lifts its agricultural protections , the candy-maker needs the export refunds , which amounted to 330,000 euros last year .
" if we did n't get this money , we would be forced to cut the employment partially in europe and produce these products outside of europe , for example in turkey , where we can buy sugar at the world market price , " preusser said .
without these subsidies , it is quite possible that haribo 's original german theme song might not have been translated into so many languages .
but for now , as the song says , " kids and grownups love it so , the happy world of haribo . "

" this has resulted in high prevalence of hiv and limited access to drugs among other things in recent years , " she said , adding that the company had donated the millionth dose of mother-child viramune -lrb- nevirapine -rrb- tablets , syrup , hiv test kits and 1ml syringes to prevent mother-to-child transmission -lrb- pmtct -rrb- during birth to the malawi government . improved hiv / aids situation the malawi government has said deaths caused by hiv / aids have decreased to 48 per day this year from 240 per day in 2004 .
an estimated 1 million people , of the country 's 13 million , are living with hiv / aids and of those just over 80,000 are children , according to malawi 's national aids commission . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 80,000 thousand children in malawi suffer from hiv / aids about 104,000 hiv-positive women give birth in a year with an infection rate of more than 30 percent of the newborns . a combination of factors such as hiv testing , access to anti-retroviral therapy and improved nutrition had led to the reduction , said mary shaba , the government 's principal secretary responsible for nutrition and aids . the malawi network of people living with hiv and aids -lrb- manet + -rrb- has also said malawi had been successful in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with the illness and in increasing the likelihood of those infected with hiv to disclose their status to their partners . the organization 's acting program manager george kampango said malawi has been able to achieve this by promoting multi-sector approaches , advocacy campaigns , review meetings and the development of national and workplace policies on hiv and aids , among other things . mother-to-child services the current coverage and uptake of pmtct services , which are technically and financially supported by non-government organizations , are still too low to impact the epidemic among children , doctors without borders pmtct coordinator leopold buhendwa said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions in malawi are dependent on outside aid " however , all these ngos operate within government or mission health facilities using existing staff or employing additional ones , " he said . buhendwa also noted that pmtct services were not well integrated into maternal and child services and , therefore , were not linked to anti-retroviral therapy services . " on top of that , up to 50 percent of women do not deliver in health facilities , " buhendwa added . traditional midwives still popular health experts in malawi agree that in many remote villages , most childbirths are attended by a traditional birth attendant and their skills and knowledge vary hugely .
but to many women they present the best hope of improving the care of the most vulnerable . the united nations family and population agency said that maternal death and disability could be dramatically reduced if every woman had access to health services throughout her lifecycle - especially during pregnancy and childbirth . but there could be a simple and relatively inexpensive way to reduce dramatically the number of women who die in childbirth , said professor anthony costello , a pediatrician in london who has worked for several decades in countries such as malawi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : access to a few basic drugs could make a big difference in deaths related to childbirth he said he believes birth attendants and community volunteers need a maternity kit with two critical drugs : antibiotics to treat infection and misoprostol to treat postpartum hemorrhaging - two big killers of women in childbirth . " if these cheap drugs were distributed widely enough , lives would be saved immediately , " he said . germany to help with health care reform african countries are particularly reliant on external donors with 23 countries depending on foreign aid for more than 30 percent of their total health care needs , according to world bank statistics . in most cases african governments have used this aid to expand their health services , but they are highly dependent on the uninterrupted flow of aid to keep health services available to people , especially the poor and most vulnerable , the bank said . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development supports the malawian government in reforming the health system as part of a cross-sector approach . " one priority for reform is the decentralization of the health system in order to give the population better access to basic health care , " the ministry said in a statement .
" to this end , cooperation in the health sector between the state , district parliaments and non-governmental organizations has long been promoted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 22.06.2009 lukashenko pursues old tactics , not new strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between lukashenko , right , and putin are strained despite overtures to the eu and a recent row with russia , belarus is n't going to turn away from its big neighbor any time soon .
instead minsk is merely continuing with a long-established strategy . for someone not necessarily known for his openess toward the west , alexander lukashenko made a somewhat unusual plea to his guest .
" we honestly want to forge good ties , even if this may not be to somebody 's liking , " the belarusian president told benita ferrero-waldner , eu commissioner for external relations , during her visit to minsk on monday .
lukashenko was referring of course to russia , his country 's long-time ally , which does n't want minsk to get too chummy with europe .
while russia and belarus had at one time even planned to form a union of both states , relations between moscow and minsk have turned sour recently .
in a move that angered russia , belarus has refused to recognize georgia 's breakaway provinces south ossetia and abkhazia as independent states .
russia , meanwhile , stopped all belarusian dairy products at its border and froze a $ 500 million loan to the country .
in addition gazprom , russia 's energy giant , is demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in back payments from belarus .
while the dairy dispute has been settled , the other issues remain unresolved .
so has lukashenko amid increasing russian pressure on his regime made a strategic decision to turn away from moscow and focus on brussels instead ?
pressure points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko met with the pope at the vatican in april in his first trip to west in years no , says fraser cameron , director of the eu-russia center .
" russia has too many pressure points .
russia is the biggest investor in belarus and probably knows the country as good as anyone . "
what 's more , moscow 's military-industrial complex plays a large role in belarus , a country where these types of informal relations are very important .
belarus is clearly trying to play russia and the eu off of each other , says amanda akçakoca , a policy analyst with the european policy center in brussels .
andrew wilson from the european council of foreign relations adds that lukashenko is the most experienced of all the leaders of the former soviet republics at pitting russia against europe for his own political purposes .
but lukashenko , who was once called europe 's last dictator by former us secretary of state condoleezza rice , could n't just break away from russia even he wanted .
his country is simply too dependent on russia .
not only is it belarus ' main trading partner , but without the cheap energy supplies from across the border , minsk would have gone bankrupt years ago .
so what is the current spat between russia and belarus all about ?
mainly three things , say the experts : personal relations , economics and politics .
" it 's a well known fact that russian prime minister vladimir putin ca n't stand lukaschenko , " says akçakoca .
putin has believed for a long time that moscow should get more value from the money it pumps into minsk , argues wilson : " russia feels that belarus should be one of its most loyal allies , but instead finds belarus often being one of its most annoying allies . "
therefore , russia , after helping to keep lukashenko in office in 2006 , has stepped up the pressure on the president in an effort to benefit more from the close relationship between both states .
new leadership required bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus is economically dependent on its biggest trading partner russia but so far russia has n't made much progress , the experts point out .
instead belarus , which has been badly hit by the financial crisis , is the only country that has managed to receive money from both the international monetary fund and russia .
lukashenko 's recent ouverture to the eu is similar in nature .
" lukashenko wants to open up to europe economically , but not politically , " says wilson .
his goal is to see what he can get from the eu and then go to russia and try for something better , argues akçakoca .
there is n't much europe can do to bring about reforms in belarus .
the decision by the eu to lift long-time sanctions against lukashenko and his regime was right , says akçakoca .
" the sanctions did n't work at all . "
now the eu is taking a step-by-step approach to belarus as part of the eastern partnership program , offering technical and financial assistance in exchange for concrete political reforms .
lukashenko has released some opposition leaders , but other than that there has n't been much change on the ground in belarus , says akçakoca , who thinks that the eu generally is on the right track now with its belarus policy .
" it 's better than isolation , " she adds , " but for a real change there has to be a new leadership in belarus . " author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court ruled that bangladeshi independence from pakistan in 1971 was first proclaimed by sheikh mujibur rahman , the first president .
mr rahman was the father of the current prime minister , sheikh hasina .
the opposition bnp has always said that independence was declared by the late husband of its leader , khaleda zia .
there has been no reaction to the court 's ruling yet from the opposition party .
the two main parties - awami league and bnp- have differed for decades over who should be seen as the true father of the nation .
bangladesh is a bitterly divided country , dominated by two political clans with their own versions of history , and convinced that only they have the right to govern .
the two main parties both claim that their former leader should be seen as the true father of the bangladeshi nation .
as power has alternated between the two , so the history books have each time been re-written .
now , six months after a decisive election victory for sheikh hasina 's awami league , the high court in dhaka has ruled that her father , sheikh mujibur rahman , did in fact proclaim independence in a speech he gave as the war began .
it said that all claims to the contrary were lies .
the government will no doubt hope that this ruling settles the matter , but if the past is anything to go on , neither side will ever be ready to admit that it is wrong .
sheikh mujibur rahman become the first president of independent bangladesh in january 1972 .
he was assassinated in 1975 .

as power has alternated between the two , so the history books have each time been re-written .
now , six months after a decisive election victory for sheikh hasina 's awami league , the high court in dhaka has ruled that her father , sheikh mujibur rahman , did in fact proclaim independence in a speech he gave as the war began .
it said that all claims to the contrary were lies .
the government will no doubt hope that this ruling settles the matter , but if the past is anything to go on , neither side will ever be ready to admit that it is wrong .
sheikh mujibur rahman become the first president of independent bangladesh in january 1972 .
he was assassinated in 1975 .

the court ruled that bangladeshi independence from pakistan in 1971 was first proclaimed by sheikh mujibur rahman , the first president .
mr rahman was the father of the current prime minister , sheikh hasina .
the opposition bnp has always said that independence was declared by the late husband of its leader , khaleda zia .
there has been no reaction to the court 's ruling yet from the opposition party .
the two main parties - awami league and bnp- have differed for decades over who should be seen as the true father of the nation .
bangladesh is a bitterly divided country , dominated by two political clans with their own versions of history , and convinced that only they have the right to govern .
the two main parties both claim that their former leader should be seen as the true father of the bangladeshi nation .
as power has alternated between the two , so the history books have each time been re-written .
now , six months after a decisive election victory for sheikh hasina 's awami league , the high court in dhaka has ruled that her father , sheikh mujibur rahman , did in fact proclaim independence in a speech he gave as the war began .
it said that all claims to the contrary were lies .
the government will no doubt hope that this ruling settles the matter , but if the past is anything to go on , neither side will ever be ready to admit that it is wrong .
sheikh mujibur rahman become the first president of independent bangladesh in january 1972 .
he was assassinated in 1975 .

a national framework was set up in 2003 to ensure those diabetics were offered education to manage their condition .
the assembly government said structured education was " patchy " and added it needed to give it greater priority .
diabetes uk cymru said to do nothing was a false economy and could lead to a " catastrophe " within the population .
statistics obtained by the organisation show around 42 people with diabetes in wales will have a heart attack every week and five people will have a limb amputation .
the cost to the nation is 10 % of the overall nhs budget - £ 500m or £ 55,000 an hour .
around 5 % of the population have diabetes but that figure is expected to double in the next 10 years .
experts agree that better screening services , education and awareness is the best way to tackle the issue .
in carmarthenshire , a six-week course has been set up to offer patients advice on how to manage their condition and how to prevent other diabetes-related diseases developing .
richard thomas , who was diagnosed with type two diabetes , attended such a class .
" the course has made such a difference ... they motivate you so much .
i 'm going to live with diabetes - it has n't beaten me and it wo n't , " he said .
but research has shown only 2 % of patients have attended such courses and questions over the consistency of services have been raised .
' catastrophe ' liberal democrat health spokesman peter black said : " parts of wales , you can go and you can be diagnosed early , you can get the treatment you need .
" in other parts of wales that does n't happen , and clearly that is a discrepancy which the government needs to address as part of rolling out this strategy . "
dai williams of diabetes uk cymru added : " to not do anything is a false economy .
" it 's going to lead to a catastrophe within the population .
" a small amount of money spent on structured education , we would save ourselves a fortune in wales and spend the money where it 's really needed . "
in response , a welsh assembly government spokesperson said it recognised the value of providing structured education to help patients manage their condition but said it was not appropriate in all cases .
he added that despite not all attending courses , education was provided to those with diabetes .
" we recognise that structured education is still patchy across wales and that we need to improve this by giving it a greater priority , " he said .
he added that monitoring the nhs progress with implementing the diabetes national framework was being stepped up with local health boards being asked to put delivery plans in place .
he added : " in performance-managing the nhs on progress with their plans , officials will challenge the need to give a higher priority to structured education . "

det supt kevin o 'neill from south wales police said : " this campaign was piloted in december 2008 and indications are that it helped to contribute to a significant reduction in this type of crime during december and january with the number of incidents reported dropping from 16 to five .
' sexual vulnerability ' " the main objective of this campaign is to make people realise their vulnerability when under the influence of alcohol , particularly their sexual vulnerability , as alcohol features within two-thirds of all rapes reported to the police .
" through this campaign we also want to encourage people to report rape . "
he said every force had specially trained officers to offer victim support .
libby jones , the chief executive of the merthyr and swansea sarc said : " this is a hard-hitting campaign which clearly illustrates the devastating consequences rape can have .
