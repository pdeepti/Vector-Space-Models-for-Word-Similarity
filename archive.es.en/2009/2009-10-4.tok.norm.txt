the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

button needed a five-point advantage over brazilian barrichello to win the championship ahead of time , but saw his lead trimmed once again .
in the overall standings with two races remaining - in brazil and abu dhabi - button has 85 points to barrichello 's 71 and vettel 's 69 .

hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .

british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "

and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .

f-1 leader jenson button of britain crossed the line in eighth place , one spot behind his brawn gp teammate , rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : the red bull crew could hardly wait to congratulate the german suzuka leaves championship open sunday 's list of top finishers , however , did nothing to resolve this year 's title ambitions .
button needed a five-point advantage over brazilian barrichello to win the championship ahead of time , but saw his lead trimmed once again .
in the overall standings with two races remaining - in brazil and abu dhabi - button has 85 points to barrichello 's 71 and vettel 's 69 .
brawn , meanwhile , now needs just one more point to take the constructors championship ahead of red bull .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel led the pack into the first curve and never relinquished his lead .
only 19 cars started the race in suzuka , after the german toyota pilot timo glock crashed in qualifying , leaving him with a leg injury and unable to drive .
hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .
" i saw a silver arrow to the left of me , but i stayed in the middle and then had the advantage as we went around the corner , " vettel said .
" after that , i just kept my head down and went as fast as i could . "
the young german managed to hold hamilton off and then began putting some tarmac between them - a gap he maintained to the end .
at one stage during the 53-lap , 307-kilometer race , vettel was out in front by as much as 11 seconds - something close to an eon in formula one racing. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

hertha , under its new coach friedhem funkel , took an early lead when team captain arne friedrich headed one in from the corner .
but it was all for naught as hamburg evened things up in the 24th minute courtesy of hertha defender kaka , who headed it neatly over goalie timo ochs for an own goal .
they then added another pair to make it 3-0 at the half-time whistle .
hertha was playing without its injured goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .
two minutes later , in what appeared to be an unbelievable replay , burchert again ran out of his area and ze roberto picked up the clearance from inside the center circle and arced it into an empty net .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical .
-lrb- 01.10.2009 -rrb- germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .
but is germany the weak link in attempts to bring tehran to the table ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .

karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 04.10.2009 after irish backing , reform treaty faces hurdles in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lisbon reform treaty needs to be ratified by all 27 eu members having secured ireland 's support for the lisbon reform treaty , the european union now faces the tough job of convincing the accord 's most vocal opponents , the czech republic and poland , to vote for it . relieved eu leaders have hailed ireland 's vote to accept the lisbon reform treaty , but almost immediately attention has turned to the last two nations holding up efforts to streamline the european union decision-making process .
french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hertha , under its new coach friedhem funkel , took an early lead when team captain arne friedrich headed one in from the corner .
but it was all for naught as hamburg evened things up in the 24th minute courtesy of hertha defender kaka , who headed it neatly over goalie timo ochs for an own goal .
they then added another pair to make it 3-0 at the half-time whistle .
hertha was playing without its injured goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .
two minutes later , in what appeared to be an unbelievable replay , burchert again ran out of his area and ze roberto picked up the clearance from inside the center circle and arced it into an empty net .
hertha now languishes at the bottom of the table .

hertha , under its new coach friedhem funkel , took an early lead when team captain arne friedrich headed one in from the corner .
but it was all for naught as hamburg evened things up in the 24th minute courtesy of hertha defender kaka , who headed it neatly over goalie timo ochs for an own goal .
they then added another pair to make it 3-0 at the half-time whistle .
hertha was playing without its injured goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .
two minutes later , in what appeared to be an unbelievable replay , burchert again ran out of his area and ze roberto picked up the clearance from inside the center circle and arced it into an empty net .
hertha now languishes at the bottom of the table .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

they then added another pair to make it 3-0 at the half-time whistle .
hertha was playing without its injured goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .

hertha now languishes at the bottom of the table .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disarmament -pipe- 04.10.2009 experts support westerwelle 's quest to rid germany of us nuclear arms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear weapons in germany soon a thing of the past ?
the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

hertha , under its new coach friedhem funkel , took an early lead when team captain arne friedrich headed one in from the corner .
but it was all for naught as hamburg evened things up in the 24th minute courtesy of hertha defender kaka , who headed it neatly over goalie timo ochs for an own goal .
they then added another pair to make it 3-0 at the half-time whistle .
hertha was playing without its injured goalkeeper jaroslav drobny .
and things got worse when ochs left the game with a muscle tear leaving hertha to defend the goal with 19-year old sascha burchert who was playing in only in his third bundesliga game .
after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .
two minutes later , in what appeared to be an unbelievable replay , burchert again ran out of his area and ze roberto picked up the clearance from inside the center circle and arced it into an empty net .
hertha now languishes at the bottom of the table .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical .
-lrb- 01.10.2009 -rrb- germany confronts tough decisions in the face of sanctions on iran in the wake of further missile tests , it 's becoming more likely that the west will impose further sanctions against iran .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .

karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .

"
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de experts doubt usefulness of further sanctions against iran western powers have signalled iran could face further international sanctions if talks about tehran 's nuclear activities in geneva fail .
but is this the answer ?
german political experts are sceptical .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

ferrari 's kimi raikkonen hung on for fourth , ahead of germany 's nico rosberg for williams .
bmw-sauber 's nick heidfeldt of germany finished sixth .
f-1 leader jenson button of britain crossed the line in eighth place , one spot behind his brawn gp teammate , rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : the red bull crew could hardly wait to congratulate the german suzuka leaves championship open sunday 's list of top finishers , however , did nothing to resolve this year 's title ambitions .
button needed a five-point advantage over brazilian barrichello to win the championship ahead of time , but saw his lead trimmed once again .
in the overall standings with two races remaining - in brazil and abu dhabi - button has 85 points to barrichello 's 71 and vettel 's 69 .
brawn , meanwhile , now needs just one more point to take the constructors championship ahead of red bull .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel led the pack into the first curve and never relinquished his lead .
only 19 cars started the race in suzuka , after the german toyota pilot timo glock crashed in qualifying , leaving him with a leg injury and unable to drive .
hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .
" i saw a silver arrow to the left of me , but i stayed in the middle and then had the advantage as we went around the corner , " vettel said .
" after that , i just kept my head down and went as fast as i could . "
the young german managed to hold hamilton off and then began putting some tarmac between them - a gap he maintained to the end .
at one stage during the 53-lap , 307-kilometer race , vettel was out in front by as much as 11 seconds - something close to an eon in formula one racing. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is this the answer ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .
that meeting is a follow up to talks in geneva . rb / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .

kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .

hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .

" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

ferrari 's kimi raikkonen hung on for fourth , ahead of germany 's nico rosberg for williams .
bmw-sauber 's nick heidfeldt of germany finished sixth .
f-1 leader jenson button of britain crossed the line in eighth place , one spot behind his brawn gp teammate , rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : the red bull crew could hardly wait to congratulate the german suzuka leaves championship open sunday 's list of top finishers , however , did nothing to resolve this year 's title ambitions .
button needed a five-point advantage over brazilian barrichello to win the championship ahead of time , but saw his lead trimmed once again .
in the overall standings with two races remaining - in brazil and abu dhabi - button has 85 points to barrichello 's 71 and vettel 's 69 .
brawn , meanwhile , now needs just one more point to take the constructors championship ahead of red bull .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel led the pack into the first curve and never relinquished his lead .
only 19 cars started the race in suzuka , after the german toyota pilot timo glock crashed in qualifying , leaving him with a leg injury and unable to drive .
hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .
" i saw a silver arrow to the left of me , but i stayed in the middle and then had the advantage as we went around the corner , " vettel said .
" after that , i just kept my head down and went as fast as i could . "
the young german managed to hold hamilton off and then began putting some tarmac between them - a gap he maintained to the end .
at one stage during the 53-lap , 307-kilometer race , vettel was out in front by as much as 11 seconds - something close to an eon in formula one racing. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ferrari 's kimi raikkonen hung on for fourth , ahead of germany 's nico rosberg for williams .
bmw-sauber 's nick heidfeldt of germany finished sixth .
f-1 leader jenson button of britain crossed the line in eighth place , one spot behind his brawn gp teammate , rubens barrichello .
bildunterschrift : the red bull crew could hardly wait to congratulate the german suzuka leaves championship open sunday 's list of top finishers , however , did nothing to resolve this year 's title ambitions .
button needed a five-point advantage over brazilian barrichello to win the championship ahead of time , but saw his lead trimmed once again .
in the overall standings with two races remaining - in brazil and abu dhabi - button has 85 points to barrichello 's 71 and vettel 's 69 .
brawn , meanwhile , now needs just one more point to take the constructors championship ahead of red bull .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel led the pack into the first curve and never relinquished his lead .
only 19 cars started the race in suzuka , after the german toyota pilot timo glock crashed in qualifying , leaving him with a leg injury and unable to drive .
hamilton , who started third , had no problems overtaking trulli down the stretch and came close to catching vettel in the first corner .
" i knew that the start would be tough and it was closer than i thought it would be , " vettel said after the race .
" i saw a silver arrow to the left of me , but i stayed in the middle and then had the advantage as we went around the corner , " vettel said .
" after that , i just kept my head down and went as fast as i could . "
the young german managed to hold hamilton off and then began putting some tarmac between them - a gap he maintained to the end .
at one stage during the 53-lap , 307-kilometer race , vettel was out in front by as much as 11 seconds - something close to an eon in formula one racing. gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 04.10.2009 economy could sink government as greeks go to the polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister karamanlis ' conservative government is likely to lose the election voting is underway in greece in a general election expected to sweep out the conservatives and return the socialists to power .
a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .

the move follows negotiations last week in geneva between iran and six world powers – the first such talks in 15 months . international atomic energy agency chief mohammed elbaradei made the announcement at a joint press conference with iran 's nuclear chief ali akbar salehi in tehran on sunday .
" it is important for us to have comprehensive cooperation over the qom site ...
it is important for us to send our inspectors to assure ourselves that this facility is for peaceful purposes , " elbaradei said .
iran last month disclosed the existence of the second unranium-enrichment facility near the holy shi 'ite city of qom , sparking an international outcry .
tehran says the site , which has space for about 3,000 centrifuges , is about 18 months away from going on line .
the west suspects the islamic state is covertly seeking to develop nuclear weapons .
iran insists it needs the nuclear technology to generate power to meet booming domestic demand .
praise for iranian " cooperation " elbaradei also praised a shift " from conspiracy to cooperation " in tehran 's dealings with the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elbaradei says relations with iran are shifting in a positive way " i see that we are shifting gears from confrontation into transparency and co-operation .
i continue , of course , to call on iran to be as transparent as possible , " he said .
elbaradei 's visit comes as the new york times quoted an internal iaea report as saying iran could have the know-how to produce a workable nuclear bomb .
elbaradei said the iaea had " no concrete proof " of a weaponization programme in iran .
but he added that his agency remained concerned over the possibility .
" there are concerns about iran 's future intentions and this is not a verification thing , " he said .
" we are concerned but we are in no way panicking about iran 's nuclear programme . "
elbaradei 's visit to tehran came after iran agreed with six world powers – the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany – in geneva on thursday to allow iaea inspectors unfettered access to the plant in central iran .
western officials said iran had agreed " in principle " in thursday 's meeting to ship out most of its enriched uranium for reprocessing in russia and france .
it would then be returned to power a tehran reactor that makes medical isotopes .
geneva talks could win iran a reprieve the latest talks in geneva are expected to win iran a reprieve from tougher un sanctions , although western powers are likely to be wary of any attempt by tehran to buy further time to develop its nuclear programme .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana sounded a note of optimism after the geneva talks the geneva talks were the first of their kind for 15 months , and western officials acknowledged they marked iran 's " engagement " on its nuclear programme , something that they said tehran had refused to discuss since july 2008 .
after the talks , eu foreign policy chief javier solana had said that iran had agreed to cooperate " fully and immediately " over its second uranium enrichment facility near qom .
he expressed hope that the six world powers now expect iaea inspections of the plant to be allowed within two weeks .
senior us officials said part of the outcome might temper more immediate fears , especially in the middle east , that iran had accumulated enough enriched uranium to produce a nuclear weapon .
elbaradei said that officials from the united states , russia , france and iran would hold talks in vienna on october 19 on the possible higher enrichment abroad of tehran 's uranium .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

after just five minutes on the pitch , burchert came out of the goal and david jarolim knocked the ball in from 30 meters out .

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man widely tipped to be germany 's new foreign minister has renewed his call for the last remaining us nuclear weapons to be removed from the country .
could this signal a shake-up in german foreign policy ? at the beginning of this week , the new man at the side of chancellor angela merkel , urged the rapid launch of negotiations for the withdrawal of us nuclear weapons from german soil .
guido westerwelle 's call is not new , but both domestic and international circumstances have changed considerably since the fdp leader first advocated this policy five years ago .
his party , the fdp , has just returned to power after 11 years in opposition and its leader is expected to become foreign minister in the new coalition with the conservatives .
and if he does become foreign minister , westerwelle could get a sympathetic hearing from president barack obama who has called for a worldwide reduction of nuclear weapons .
showing the way last week , westerwelle welcomed the un security council ’ s unanimous resolution in favor of global disarmament and non-proliferation and pledged to rid germany of nuclear weapons within the next four years .
" germany has to set a good example when it comes to disarmament by getting the atomic weapons stationed in this country removed , " said the fdp leader .
" they are a relic of the cold war and do not increase our security .
president obama and now the united nations have pushed the door to a new era of disarmament wide open .
germany , in particular , has to make the most of this opportunity and set an example to the wannabe nuclear states . " bildunterschrift : the fdp leader wants to make his mark westerwelle 's initiative is not likely to encounter any resistance from the ranks of the opposition .
the social democrats , the greens and the left party have all previously expressed their support for the move .
but how the fdp 's coalition partners , the christian democrats , will react remains to be seen .
traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

traditionally , the party has seen nuclear weaponry as an essential part of german security policy .
earlier this year , ruprecht polenz -lrb- cdu -rrb- warned , in an interview with the tagespiegel newspaper , against " laying down the law or pressurizing the americans in this matter . "
the chairman of the bundestag 's foreign relations committee said the continued presence of us troops in europe was in germany 's interest , and that it was up to the americans to decide how they wanted to protect their troops .
shrouded in secrecy exactly how many us nuclear devices remain on german soil and where they are sited remains a matter for speculation .
the german government will not comment upon either the deployment or the number of weapons .
experts estimate that there are currently some 20 warheads stored at germany 's only remaining weapon base in buechel , near the border with luxemburg .
another us base in ramstein was emptied of its arsenal of 130 or so atomic weapons by 2007 , according to the federation of american scientists .
last year , a study commissioned by the us air force criticized the security and safety standards at most sites for nuclear weapons in europe , including germany .
hans-joachim giessmann , director of berghof conflict research , welcomed the initiative .
" the military value of these weapons is zero , but their psychological effect is enormous .
it 's time that they were reduced . "
the real end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has always had a strong peace movement the move would represent the end of an era .
the americans first brought nuclear weapons to west germany in march 1955 .
by the late-1980s , more than 2,570 nuclear weapons were deployed at dozens of locations across the country .
their withdrawal could make an important contribution to the non-proliferation debate , according to giessmann , and help improve relations with other parts of the world .
" whoever wants to credibly call for countries to forego atomic weapons must also be prepared to get rid of unnecessary systems , " the peace studies expert said . security policy expert joachim krause , of kiel university , also stressed that the weapons lacked military significance , while remaining a political symbol .
" they are a leftover from the cold war .
we no longer have to fear a russian attack .
we no longer need nuclear weapons on our territory . "
but the removal of the warheads raises a safety issue , according to krause .
he stressed that it was important to determine what would happen to the warheads .
" they currently do not represent a threat .
they are stored safely .
the most important question is where they will end up and if they are secure , " said krause . the political scientist was also critical of the tactics of the foreign minister in waiting .
" i am always against conducting diplomacy in the public sphere .
if we want to get rid of them , the us would agree .
but it would be better to first clear this up with the americans and then clarify it in public . "
potential opposition within nato bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's initiative could cause problems in nato and whether germany 's eastern european neighbors see eye-to-eye with guido westerwelle on this matter is questionable .
political scientist christian tuschhoff , of the free university , warned that there had been a paradigm shift within some , but not all nato members ' thinking when it comes to global security .
" the united states , germany and other western european countries no longer see russia as the challenge .
they see nato 's most important functions in such things as the fight against terrorism and piracy off the coast of somalia , " said tuschhoff .
but he stressed that nato members with a border with russia still saw nato 's chief function as guaranteeing the defence of their territory . " i do n't think there will be much debate with the united states on this issue .
they have called for a massive reduction in nuclear weapons .
the problem will be with the other nato partners , " said tuschhoff .

french president nicolas sarkozy , over the weekend , called for new pressure on the obstinate leaders of poland and the czech republic , presidents lech kaczynski and vaclav klaus .
" france wants the states , which have not yet done so , to finish the ratification process as quickly as possible , so that the lisbon treaty can be implemented before the end of the year , " sarkozy said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski has been quiet on the irish outcome the german government said it was " very happy " about the outcome of the irish vote , but has been very slow to comment openly on the obstruction still posed by prague and warsaw .
' stonewalling by poles and czechs must stop ' not so somewhat lesser figures in chancellor merkel 's christian democratic union .
kurt lauk , head of the cdu economic council , did not mince words when he said on sunday that " the german government , the european parliament and the council of europe must now put massive pressure on poland and the czech republic to ratify the treaty and to demonstrate that they remain reliable and loyal partners in europe . "
" the stonewalling tactics of poland and the czech republic must be rigorously opposed , " lauk said .
poland 's president lech kaczynski said prior to the irish referendum that he would sign the treaty if ireland voted ' yes ' .
but , the euroskeptic president made no immediate comment on the irish result .
polish prime minister donald tusk , on the other hand , called for " quick action " and said he hoped president kaczynski would sign the treaty as promised .
" europe is waiting , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president klaus is one of the leading euroskeptics czech president vaclav klaus , one of the most vocal critics of the lisbon treaty , has said he would not sign the accord until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of the charter .
in prague on friday , as the irish were going to the polls , the high court ordered the president to hold off signing the treaty until it ruled on an anti-lisbon petition filed by a group of senators .
british conservatives are also skeptical doubts also linger in britain , where the opposition tories have said that if they win the national election next year , they will call a referendum .
but conservative party leader david cameron has avoided saying what he would do in the event poland and the czech republic ratify the treaty before then .
cameron said the " problem " with the lisbon treaty was that " it 's taking powers away from the national state , centralizing them in europe , and we do n't think that 's the right approach . "
british prime minister gordon brown , however , said the result of the irish vote cleared the way for the eu " to focus on the issues that matter most to europeans – a sustained economic recovery , security , tackling global poverty and action on climate change . "
the lisbon treaty is meant to streamline the administrative and decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc and untangle much of the eu 's cumbersome bureaucracy .
it is often the case now that quick and effective responses on weighty issues are delayed , or fail to materialize altogether , because action requires unanimous decisions. gb / reuters / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a series of scandals and a flagging economy have undermined the current government . greek voters are forecast to reject the conservative party of prime minister costas karamanlis in favor of the opposition socialists -lrb- pasok -rrb- led by former foreign minister george papandreou .
karamanlis has been advocating austerity measures to consolidate the country 's faltering economy and soaring budget deficit , while papandreou says a stimulus package is needed to jump-start the economy .
karamanlis called the snap election last month halfway through his second term hoping to win a fresh mandate to tackle greece 's economic woes .
but , the popularity of the prime minister , the nephew of late prime minister constantine karamanlis , has been battered by a series of financial scandals , allegations of corruption and a fragile one-vote parliamentary majority .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two political dynasties face off in greek election scandals weigh heavily on karamanlis one of the biggest attention-getters has been a shady land-swap deal involving an orthodox monastery in which a prime piece of real estate was traded for cheaper monastery land at a cost of about 100 million euros -lrb- $ 145 million -rrb- to the taxpayers .
karamanlis has gambled that he has a better chance of winning now than at the end of his current four-year term in 2011 .
but , according to the latest opinion polls , that gamble may not pay off .
the last survey before sunday 's ballot put the socialists ahead by about six percentage points with nearly 20 percent of voters still undecided .
smaller parties , however , could undo the chances for a majority of either of the big parties .
the greens , in particular , have sharpened their profile following a number of disastrous forest fires outside athens this summer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poor handling of summer brush fires is also an election issue should neither big party win an outright majority , the country would be plunged into political limbo until fresh elections could be held .
with a budget deficit expected to exceed eight percent of gross domestic product this year , karamanlis has promised to fight tax evasion and freeze public sector hiring , pensions and salaries to curtail government expenses .
public debt , meanwhile , has also soared to nearly 100 percent of gdp .
his socialist challenger , papandreou , who has lost twice to karamanlis in 2004 and 2007 , says he will raise taxes on the rich and boost economic growth with a three-billion-euro -lrb- $ 4.3 billion -rrb- stimulus package .
