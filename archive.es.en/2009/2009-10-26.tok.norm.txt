the bosnian serb wartime leader is accused of genocide and war crimes . it was october 14 , 1991 .
yugoslavia had already fallen apart and fighting was rampant across croatia .
in the parliament of bosnia and herzegovina , the serb leader radovan karadzic stepped up to the lectern .
he then proceeded to issue a threat to muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats , who wanted to become independent from the serb-dominated remainder of the multi-ethnic state .
" consider that you could thereby lead bosnia and herzegovina to hell and perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation , " karadzic told the parliament .
" if there is war here , the muslim people will not be able to defend themselves . "
shortly thereafter , in the spring of 1992 , the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war two broke out in bosnia .
more than 110,000 people died , over a million were temporarily displaced .
for three-and-a-half years , the serbs shelled the beleaguered capital sarajevo with grenades .
snipers were also in action .
the sad climax came before the end of the war in 1995 : the execution of almost 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the scene of the largest mass murder in europe since world war two no mercy for karadzic in numerous concentration camps , women were massively raped and men beaten to death .
" i was heavily injured on my torso and stomach , " said murat tahirovic , who survived the abuse .
" the stomach wound was kept open and my torturers stuck a police baton in it .
i was beaten , several teeth were knocked out .
i was offended , mentally tortured , was n't allowed to use the toilet .
and you could n't wash yourself anyway . "
tahirovic was in his mid-20s at the time and a soldier in the bosniak army .
he was taken captive and put in a camp near the border to croatia .
after two months , the former mining engineer was freed .
today , he still suffers from constant pain and the pictures from then continue to haunt him .
in retrospect , tahirovic , who heads an association of former bosniak concentration camp detainees , said he does n't bear a grudge against his direct tormentors .
" they were too young at the time , manipulated by the media and put under pressure , " tahirovic said .
" in some respects , i forgive them . " but those who instructed the deeds , who were aware of the torture , they could not be forgiven , he said .
this was particularly the case for karadzic .
guilt confirmed the charges against karadzic at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia total 11 points .
numerous previous judgments by the tribunal in the hague confirm that the crimes occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic pleaded not guilty at the un yugoslav war crimes tribunal mirsad tokaca , head of the war crimes research and documentation center in sarajevo , said the evidence against karadzic was overwhelming .
there could be no doubt of his guilt in the brutal human rights violations by the serbs in bosnia against muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats .
tokaca said karadzic triggered the war and knew he could count on slobodan milosevic , the nationalist and authoritarian president of serbia at the time .
" karadzic knew that belgrade and serbia were behind him , the milosevic regime and the yugoslav army , " tokaca said .
" the crimes which are considered key events were committed in april , may and in part june and july of 1992 .
at this time , the yugoslavian army was fighting for karadzic 's ideas with force of arms . "
tokaca has even delivered evidence of this : audio recordings from sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : the bosnian capital sarajevo suffered great destruction during the war karadzic was milosevic 's political protege and war ally .
the tribunal 's prosecutors are of the view that milosevic and karadzic and other serbian politicians and officers wanted to use the collapse of yugoslavia to forcibly take over those areas in croatia and bosnia inhabited by serbs .
from a hobby poet to a miracle healer milosevic died during his trial in the hague .
just as he did , karadzic is defending himself before the tribunal and expected to use the courtroom as a political stage .
the psychiatrist senadin ljubovic , who helps bosnian war victims , said karadzic is convinced that he acted correctly .
" he 'll even say he was forced to order the murder of those many people , " ljubovic said .
" he had warned them beforehand but they did n't want to listen to him .
i do n't think that he 'll ever show remorse . "
ljubovic was karadzic 's mentor .
he introduced the then young student to psychiatry at the clinic in sarajevo .
the hobby poet karadzic came to the bosnian capital with his parents from the montenegrin mountains .
later , he was prosecuted for embezzlement but never went to prison thanks to his unofficial collaboration with the intelligence service .
at the beginning of the war in bosnia , the nationalist was elected serbian president .
after the end of the war and arraignment , karadzic disappeared and was on the run for more than 13 years .
when he was caught last summer , he worked as a miracle healer in serbia 's capital belgrade .
since then , he 's been in custody in the hague .
karadzic is being held responsible for murder , torture and displacement during the balkan war 15 years ago .
he denies any guilt .
according to jurists , he can expect a lifelong sentence if convicted .

there could be no doubt of his guilt in the brutal human rights violations by the serbs in bosnia against muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats .
tokaca said karadzic triggered the war and knew he could count on slobodan milosevic , the nationalist and authoritarian president of serbia at the time .
" karadzic knew that belgrade and serbia were behind him , the milosevic regime and the yugoslav army , " tokaca said .
" the crimes which are considered key events were committed in april , may and in part june and july of 1992 .
at this time , the yugoslavian army was fighting for karadzic 's ideas with force of arms . "
tokaca has even delivered evidence of this : audio recordings from sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : the bosnian capital sarajevo suffered great destruction during the war karadzic was milosevic 's political protege and war ally .
the tribunal 's prosecutors are of the view that milosevic and karadzic and other serbian politicians and officers wanted to use the collapse of yugoslavia to forcibly take over those areas in croatia and bosnia inhabited by serbs .
from a hobby poet to a miracle healer milosevic died during his trial in the hague .
just as he did , karadzic is defending himself before the tribunal and expected to use the courtroom as a political stage .
the psychiatrist senadin ljubovic , who helps bosnian war victims , said karadzic is convinced that he acted correctly .
" he 'll even say he was forced to order the murder of those many people , " ljubovic said .
" he had warned them beforehand but they did n't want to listen to him .
i do n't think that he 'll ever show remorse . "
ljubovic was karadzic 's mentor .
he introduced the then young student to psychiatry at the clinic in sarajevo .
the hobby poet karadzic came to the bosnian capital with his parents from the montenegrin mountains .
later , he was prosecuted for embezzlement but never went to prison thanks to his unofficial collaboration with the intelligence service .
at the beginning of the war in bosnia , the nationalist was elected serbian president .
after the end of the war and arraignment , karadzic disappeared and was on the run for more than 13 years .
when he was caught last summer , he worked as a miracle healer in serbia 's capital belgrade .
since then , he 's been in custody in the hague .
karadzic is being held responsible for murder , torture and displacement during the balkan war 15 years ago .
he denies any guilt .
according to jurists , he can expect a lifelong sentence if convicted .

the bosnian serb wartime leader is accused of genocide and war crimes . it was october 14 , 1991 .
yugoslavia had already fallen apart and fighting was rampant across croatia .
in the parliament of bosnia and herzegovina , the serb leader radovan karadzic stepped up to the lectern .
he then proceeded to issue a threat to muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats , who wanted to become independent from the serb-dominated remainder of the multi-ethnic state .
" consider that you could thereby lead bosnia and herzegovina to hell and perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation , " karadzic told the parliament .
" if there is war here , the muslim people will not be able to defend themselves . "
shortly thereafter , in the spring of 1992 , the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war two broke out in bosnia .
more than 110,000 people died , over a million were temporarily displaced .
for three-and-a-half years , the serbs shelled the beleaguered capital sarajevo with grenades .
snipers were also in action .
the sad climax came before the end of the war in 1995 : the execution of almost 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the scene of the largest mass murder in europe since world war two no mercy for karadzic in numerous concentration camps , women were massively raped and men beaten to death .
" i was heavily injured on my torso and stomach , " said murat tahirovic , who survived the abuse .
" the stomach wound was kept open and my torturers stuck a police baton in it .
i was beaten , several teeth were knocked out .
i was offended , mentally tortured , was n't allowed to use the toilet .
and you could n't wash yourself anyway . "
tahirovic was in his mid-20s at the time and a soldier in the bosniak army .
he was taken captive and put in a camp near the border to croatia .
after two months , the former mining engineer was freed .
today , he still suffers from constant pain and the pictures from then continue to haunt him .
in retrospect , tahirovic , who heads an association of former bosniak concentration camp detainees , said he does n't bear a grudge against his direct tormentors .
" they were too young at the time , manipulated by the media and put under pressure , " tahirovic said .
" in some respects , i forgive them . " but those who instructed the deeds , who were aware of the torture , they could not be forgiven , he said .
this was particularly the case for karadzic .
guilt confirmed the charges against karadzic at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia total 11 points .

while that does n't necessarily promise a lot of new jobs , it does mean munich has efficiency on its side . green potential the munich 2018 committee is counting on lots of snow for these winter games , but green is the color of its environmentally friendly bid campaign . the committee is pushing the selling point that there would be zero consumption of new land development for the 2018 munich winter olympics : the existing 1972 olympic park facilities in munich could be used for the ice sports , the schoenau am koenigssee location for the bobsled and loge events , and the snow sport events could be held in garmisch-partenkirchen . mobile sponsors " the published reports of circa 30 million euros for executing this bid process is not an application fee , rather our own budget calculation for the entire bid campaign , " said adam , explaining these funds have been secured from corporate sponsors , rather than from government funding . bmw , based in munich , was on board from the start .
the carmaker was also a sponsor of the 1972 olympics , with the 1602 elektro bmw 2002 kicking off the games and being used as a pace car .
bmw plans to play a key role in mobility and traffic programs for the 2018 winter games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich-based bmw provided the pace care in 1972 " we see this as a long-term investment in the future aimed at creating the values of tomorrow , " said joerg kottmeier , bmw 's director of sports communication .
" social responsibility is part of our corporate self image . " another sponsor that has already committed to the bid is the munich airport , which would have to play a major role in the logistics of the games .
it is currently the seventh largest airport in europe , transporting 34 million passengers per year , according to hans-juergen bues , the airport 's director of corporate communication . " we originally wanted to have this -lrb- airport -rrb- built before the 1972 olympics , now we have what it takes in place for 2018 , " said bues , who remains very optimistic in munich 's chances for being awarded the 2018 winter olympics . competition from france , south korea to win the bid , munich will have to make a stronger case than annecy , france , and pyeong chang , south korea , which have also joined the official bidding . in the meantime , winter sports fans will be heading to vancouver , canada , where the 2010 winter games take place from february 12 to 28 . author : dan roccapriore editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .

dw 's bettina marx fears that the latter is the most likely to suffer . " we want to lead the country out of the crisis to a new beginning in a new decade , " says the preamble to the coalition contract that the christian democrat union and the free democratic party agreed after three weeks of tough negotiations .
but how this is meant to work remains vague , and is apparently based mainly on hope - the hope that the economic cycle will turn , that the economy will recover quickly , that new jobs will emerge , and that the mountain of debt will be reduced .
but these are illusions rather than hopes .
one thing is already certain : if the new government implements its program , the state 's debts will increase further .
tax breaks worth 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- a year are set to be introduced on jan 1 , 2010 .
but angela merkel has categorically ruled out rises in taxes like the sales tax .
where is this money meant to come from ?
while presenting the coalition contract alongside horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union , and fdp chairman guido westerwelle , merkel confined herself to rather vague phrases .
" we want to walk the path of growth , " she said at the press conference in berlin , " we have to think dynamically . "
people should get more net income out of their gross income , and hard work should be rewarded again .
but whatever the government wants to put in one pocket , it will have to pull out of all the other pockets .
the financial relief and extra burdens involved can hardly be balanced .
the planned reform of the healthcare system shows in what direction this is heading : social security will be increasingly privatized , the principle of a mutually supportive insured community will be compromised .
the planned restructuring of the health insurance system , due to start in 2011 , requires that any future increase in contributions will be paid for by the employee , not the employer .
on top of this , people will be legally obliged to take on additional private long-term care insurance .
this will please insurance companies - they will get millions of new contracts .
but a shudder might go through those who pay insurance premiums when they think of the millions of pensioners in the us who were plunged into poverty by the financial crisis and the recklessness of insurance companies after having paid into funded pension insurance systems .
so does this represent a permanent switch from the german contribution system based on fiscal parity to an american-style capital funded system ?
will the re-structuring of society , begun under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left government and continued under merkel 's grand coalition , finally be cemented ?
will the redistribution from the bottom up , a process that has incontrovertibly happened in the past few years , be continued ?
the coalition partners who cheerfully sat before the press on saturday morning carefully avoided any impression that their government would be one of social neglect .
they believe in social justice , they said , and they want to remove all remaining social inequalities .
these are the promises with which the cdu-fdp coalition has entered government .
now they must be measured on how they honor these promises .
we can only hope for an effective opposition .

dw 's bettina marx fears that the latter is the most likely to suffer . " we want to lead the country out of the crisis to a new beginning in a new decade , " says the preamble to the coalition contract that the christian democrat union and the free democratic party agreed after three weeks of tough negotiations .
but how this is meant to work remains vague , and is apparently based mainly on hope - the hope that the economic cycle will turn , that the economy will recover quickly , that new jobs will emerge , and that the mountain of debt will be reduced .
but these are illusions rather than hopes .
one thing is already certain : if the new government implements its program , the state 's debts will increase further .
tax breaks worth 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- a year are set to be introduced on jan 1 , 2010 .
but angela merkel has categorically ruled out rises in taxes like the sales tax .
where is this money meant to come from ?
while presenting the coalition contract alongside horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union , and fdp chairman guido westerwelle , merkel confined herself to rather vague phrases .
" we want to walk the path of growth , " she said at the press conference in berlin , " we have to think dynamically . "
people should get more net income out of their gross income , and hard work should be rewarded again .
but whatever the government wants to put in one pocket , it will have to pull out of all the other pockets .
the financial relief and extra burdens involved can hardly be balanced .
the planned reform of the healthcare system shows in what direction this is heading : social security will be increasingly privatized , the principle of a mutually supportive insured community will be compromised .
the planned restructuring of the health insurance system , due to start in 2011 , requires that any future increase in contributions will be paid for by the employee , not the employer .
on top of this , people will be legally obliged to take on additional private long-term care insurance .
this will please insurance companies - they will get millions of new contracts .
but a shudder might go through those who pay insurance premiums when they think of the millions of pensioners in the us who were plunged into poverty by the financial crisis and the recklessness of insurance companies after having paid into funded pension insurance systems .
so does this represent a permanent switch from the german contribution system based on fiscal parity to an american-style capital funded system ?
will the re-structuring of society , begun under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left government and continued under merkel 's grand coalition , finally be cemented ?
will the redistribution from the bottom up , a process that has incontrovertibly happened in the past few years , be continued ?
the coalition partners who cheerfully sat before the press on saturday morning carefully avoided any impression that their government would be one of social neglect .
they believe in social justice , they said , and they want to remove all remaining social inequalities .
these are the promises with which the cdu-fdp coalition has entered government .
now they must be measured on how they honor these promises .
we can only hope for an effective opposition .

earlier , chancellor merkel 's christian democrats approved the new coalition deal with the free democrats at a party conference in berlin .
the csu later followed suit at a party gathering in the city of munich .
the nod from merkel 's conservative bloc came after the fdp endorsed the coalition deal on sunday , following three weeks of negotiations that concluded early on saturday .
merkel told her fellow christian democrats that the proposals agreed with the fdp would work to combat the economic crisis .
" this is why we have decided to follow a path that focuses entirely on growth , " the cdu leader said , adding that this justified an increase in public debt .
merkel defended her plans to pursue billions of euros in tax relief in the face of rising debt .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint she agreed with the pro-business free democrats is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
“ tax relief the only responsible option ” in her speech to party members , merkel dismissed criticism , saying tax relief was the only responsible option for an economy that is just starting to emerge from its worst downturn since world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble had criticized tax cuts plans even before the polls however , she warned that the country 's future remained unpredictable , saying that although they were focusing on growth , " there are no guarantees it will work , but it gives us a chance . ”
“ a path of saving , saving and more saving would offer us no chance , " she added , hitting out at critics .
it is unclear how her new government will fund the tax relief .
the finance minister-designate , wolfgang schaeuble , has already said he can not guarantee the cuts will happen given germany 's shaky finances , in what analysts say is a sign that of divisions even before the new government has taken office .
some analysts have expressed concern about the prospect of a ballooning budget deficit and trade unions have said the deal will not solve germany 's economic problems .
other key elements of the coalition deal include the overhaul of health care funding and a reduction in compulsory military service from nine to six months .
cdu to dictate terms merkel also made it clear that the cdu will be the dominant partner in the new coalition government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp endorsed the coalition deal on sunday “ we will be the force of the centre .

earlier , chancellor merkel 's christian democrats approved the new coalition deal with the free democrats at a party conference in berlin .
the csu later followed suit at a party gathering in the city of munich .
the nod from merkel 's conservative bloc came after the fdp endorsed the coalition deal on sunday , following three weeks of negotiations that concluded early on saturday .
merkel told her fellow christian democrats that the proposals agreed with the fdp would work to combat the economic crisis .
" this is why we have decided to follow a path that focuses entirely on growth , " the cdu leader said , adding that this justified an increase in public debt .
merkel defended her plans to pursue billions of euros in tax relief in the face of rising debt .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint she agreed with the pro-business free democrats is a plan to slash income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- , with a focus on reducing the tax burden on families with children and reforms to corporate and inheritance tax .
“ tax relief the only responsible option ” in her speech to party members , merkel dismissed criticism , saying tax relief was the only responsible option for an economy that is just starting to emerge from its worst downturn since world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble had criticized tax cuts plans even before the polls however , she warned that the country 's future remained unpredictable , saying that although they were focusing on growth , " there are no guarantees it will work , but it gives us a chance . ”
“ a path of saving , saving and more saving would offer us no chance , " she added , hitting out at critics .
it is unclear how her new government will fund the tax relief .
the finance minister-designate , wolfgang schaeuble , has already said he can not guarantee the cuts will happen given germany 's shaky finances , in what analysts say is a sign that of divisions even before the new government has taken office .
some analysts have expressed concern about the prospect of a ballooning budget deficit and trade unions have said the deal will not solve germany 's economic problems .
other key elements of the coalition deal include the overhaul of health care funding and a reduction in compulsory military service from nine to six months .
cdu to dictate terms merkel also made it clear that the cdu will be the dominant partner in the new coalition government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fdp endorsed the coalition deal on sunday “ we will be the force of the centre .
the force that ensures that on the one hand economic growth is possible in our country and that on the other hand , everyone 's interests are represented and that we have a heart for all those who need help and solidarity , ” the chancellor said .

twelve of the most internationally renowned light artists display their work there . thirty years ago , the last shipment of beer left the linden brewery in unna , a blue-collar town in northwestern germany .
now the brewery 's series of cold rooms and cellars - left entirely unrestored - are home to the center for international light art . " the idea was to bring light art here because it 's one of the most innovative kinds of art there is , " curator ursula sinnreich told deutsche welle . the dark basement not only provides a mysterious and glamorous backdrop for the artwork , the labyrinthine structure allows each piece a room of its own . acclaimed light artists like james turrell and joseph kosuth were attracted by the ideal environment in the former brewery and in 2001 the world 's first museum dedicated exclusively to light art opened in unna . broken words and suspended water each room appeals to the senses in a different way , whether through blaring neon lights , shadows , or water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuball 's " space speach speed " comments on modern communication in one room , dusseldorf-based artists mischa kuball projects words onto mirrored balls in an installation entitled " space speech speed . "
the words are broken into a thousand pieces as they are reflected onto the wall . " in this work , kuball references new communication media that have completely changed the world in recent years , " said museum tour guide imke tietje .
" mobile phones and the internet have set the world in motion ; everyone is reachable at any time .
boundaries are broken - and that 's what 's reflected in this room . " visitors inevitably walk through the line of projection in kuball 's work , becoming part of the installation themselves . in another room , danish artist olafur eliasson has set up a disco-like strobe light .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 26.10.2009 tough times ahead for germany 's next finance minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble faces an onerous task as germany 's next finance minister germany 's new government has announced its roadmap for the next four years .
the plan involves large tax breaks .
with germany facing spiralling state debt , the incoming finance minister is confronting no easy task . while most other people are happily enjoying their retirement by the age of 67 , wolfgang schaeuble , by contrast , is about to embark on one of the biggest challenges of his life .
the former interior minister was nominated as germany 's next finance minister by german chancellor angela merkel .
schaeuble , who has been confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 , has described the post as an " honorable imposition . "
" we are currently facing a dramatic financial and economic global crisis and no one knows what will happen in two years ' time .
" this job is not subject to amusement tax , but i think that if we continue to take our responsibilities seriously , then we can successfully lead the country - as we have done up to now - through and out of this crisis , " said schaeuble .
deficit-defying plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming coalition 's tax plans provide relief for families the new government 's coalition treaty and its plan for tax breaks worth 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- will make his job a difficult one .
while the previous government comprised of a grand coalition between conservative christian democrats and social democrats decided to reduce taxes by 14 billion euros in 2010 , the conservatives and free democrats have decided to provide further tax relief for families by considerably increasing parental allowances .
in addition , cuts in inheritance and corporate taxes are planned .
the measures were pushed through by the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
its leader guido westerwelle appears confident they will pay off .
" we are convinced that fair taxes are the pre-condition for creating new jobs .
they do not just contribute towards coming out of a crisis , but they are the pre-condition for being able to improve the state 's income again , " westerwelle said .
a difficult balancing act but no one really knows whether the tax relief plan will pan out as quickly as expected .
the kiel insitute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that the state will raise two billion euros less in taxes than was expected in may .
the coalition 's plans , the effects of rising unemployment and the need to plug financial shortfalls in the german health system will also force the finance minister to run up an additional 90 billion euros of debt .
but schaeuble has defended the new government 's course .
" as soon as we have this behind us , we will have to make structural reforms and start saving .
but to save now would be exactly the wrong thing , " he said .
tight timetable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new government 's plan will not have much time to bear fruit but time is short .
from 2016 onwards , new annual borrowing by germany and its federal states will be limited to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product .
this so-called " debt brake " was inscribed in germany 's basic law by the previous coalition a few months ago .
so it is imperative that the government gets the economy growing again and boosts revenues .
german chancellor angela merkel is well aware of this .
" it 's all intended to create jobs .
hundreds of thousands of fewer jobless people will reduce spending by the federal labor office and the social insurance schemes by two billion euros . "
if the coalition 's policies to boost growth do not work out , the finance minister will have to introduce a strict austerity program within two years ' time .
swabian credentials this is a task that many people believe that schaeuble would be well cut out for , as dieter hundt , the head of german employers ' federation , makes clear .
" i think it was a very , very good decision to assign mr schaeuble the difficult office of finance minister .
it needs a very experienced , competent , clear-sighted man with stamina and the necessary toughness , as well as the attitude to money prevalent in baden-wuerttemberg , " said hundt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to reduce spending by cutting the number of jobseekers schaeuble comes from southwestern germany , an area where residents have a reputation for thriftiness .
but the new finance minister , who has a doctorate in business law , is well qualified for the job on paper , too .

the plan involves large tax breaks .
with germany facing spiralling state debt , the incoming finance minister is confronting no easy task . while most other people are happily enjoying their retirement by the age of 67 , wolfgang schaeuble , by contrast , is about to embark on one of the biggest challenges of his life .
the former interior minister was nominated as germany 's next finance minister by german chancellor angela merkel .
schaeuble , who has been confined to a wheelchair since an assassination attempt in 1990 , has described the post as an " honorable imposition . "
" we are currently facing a dramatic financial and economic global crisis and no one knows what will happen in two years ' time .
" this job is not subject to amusement tax , but i think that if we continue to take our responsibilities seriously , then we can successfully lead the country - as we have done up to now - through and out of this crisis , " said schaeuble .
deficit-defying plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming coalition 's tax plans provide relief for families the new government 's coalition treaty and its plan for tax breaks worth 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- will make his job a difficult one .
while the previous government comprised of a grand coalition between conservative christian democrats and social democrats decided to reduce taxes by 14 billion euros in 2010 , the conservatives and free democrats have decided to provide further tax relief for families by considerably increasing parental allowances .
in addition , cuts in inheritance and corporate taxes are planned .
the measures were pushed through by the pro-business free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
its leader guido westerwelle appears confident they will pay off .
" we are convinced that fair taxes are the pre-condition for creating new jobs .
they do not just contribute towards coming out of a crisis , but they are the pre-condition for being able to improve the state 's income again , " westerwelle said .
a difficult balancing act but no one really knows whether the tax relief plan will pan out as quickly as expected .
the kiel insitute for the world economy -lrb- ifw -rrb- has forecast that the state will raise two billion euros less in taxes than was expected in may .
the coalition 's plans , the effects of rising unemployment and the need to plug financial shortfalls in the german health system will also force the finance minister to run up an additional 90 billion euros of debt .
but schaeuble has defended the new government 's course .
" as soon as we have this behind us , we will have to make structural reforms and start saving .
but to save now would be exactly the wrong thing , " he said .
tight timetable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new government 's plan will not have much time to bear fruit but time is short .
from 2016 onwards , new annual borrowing by germany and its federal states will be limited to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product .
this so-called " debt brake " was inscribed in germany 's basic law by the previous coalition a few months ago .
so it is imperative that the government gets the economy growing again and boosts revenues .
german chancellor angela merkel is well aware of this .
" it 's all intended to create jobs .
hundreds of thousands of fewer jobless people will reduce spending by the federal labor office and the social insurance schemes by two billion euros . "
if the coalition 's policies to boost growth do not work out , the finance minister will have to introduce a strict austerity program within two years ' time .
swabian credentials this is a task that many people believe that schaeuble would be well cut out for , as dieter hundt , the head of german employers ' federation , makes clear .
" i think it was a very , very good decision to assign mr schaeuble the difficult office of finance minister .
it needs a very experienced , competent , clear-sighted man with stamina and the necessary toughness , as well as the attitude to money prevalent in baden-wuerttemberg , " said hundt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government plans to reduce spending by cutting the number of jobseekers schaeuble comes from southwestern germany , an area where residents have a reputation for thriftiness .
but the new finance minister , who has a doctorate in business law , is well qualified for the job on paper , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 26.10.2009 internet addresses to expand beyond latin alphabet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : web addresses required writing at least .com or .org in the latin alphabet surfing the internet is about to become much easier for people who do n't use the latin alphabet .
a multilingual address system capable of reading asian and arabic scripts will be introduced soon . the internet will get ready for web addresses written completely in non-latin characters - such as korean , chinese or arabic - when the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- finishes its 36th international public meeting this week . " this would be the biggest change technically to the internet since it was invented 40 years ago , " icann chairman peter dengate thrush said at a press conference on monday , october 26 .
" we 'd take multiple different scripts and safely and consistently convert them into web addresses . " such web addresses , which use characters outside the usual range of a to z , 0 to 9 and hyphens , are referred to as internationalized domain names -lrb- idns -rrb- .
the kinds of idns currently available require use of at least some latin text , such as " .com " or " .org. " growing use of non-latin alphabets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more people are typing internet address on non-latin keyboards using the conference , which runs until friday , icann 's board of directors plans to review measures that could enable web users to type internet domain names entirely in non-latin script by the end of the year . " this change is very much necessary for not only more than half the internet users today but more than half of all future users , " said icann president and chief executive officer rod beckstrom . " of the 1.6 billion internet users today worldwide , more than half use languages that have scripts that are not latin-based , " he added . the step is seen by many as a way to make the internet even more international . " since we started with english domain names in korea , some people feel like the internet is kind of an anglo-saxon community , " said kwon hyun joon , secretary general of the korea internet & security agency 's web address dispute resolution committee .
" the internet should be provided to all people around the globe equally , regardless of their languages . " as for how the western world would access non-latin web addresses , beckstrom suggested search engines would play a large role in surfing such sites . " people will be developing new technologies to deal with this new situation , " thrush added . security and international accountability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 1,000 internet gurus make up icann other topics up for discussion include improved internet security , more global accountability for icann - which , until september 30 , reported its progress only to the us government - and a broader range of suffixes available for use in web addresses , known as generic top-level domains . " roughly 15 billion times a day , human beings type a domain name into a web browser , " beckstrom said .
" six keystrokes - .co.kr - if those are no longer necessary that adds up to a lot of -lrb- saved -rrb- human keystrokes . " instead , the endings of web addresses could take a variety of different forms , like .berlin , to use thrush 's example .
such domains would not only be more convenient for users , but also enhance consumer confidence , he argued . icann is a nonprofit , public-benefit corporation that coordinates web addresses and names around the world .
formed in 1998 and headquartered in marina del ray , california , it holds international conferences three times per year in different regions of the globe . sms / dpa / afp / ap editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 26.10.2009 exploitation of unstable regions fuelling europe 's drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's instability feeds europe 's heroin habit the escalating instability in afghanistan , corruption and war in africa , organized crime in central asia and eastern europe , and cartel wars in latin america are all contributing to the flow of illegal drugs into europe . new figures on the state of the drugs problem in europe will be released by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in the first week of november .
the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .

the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 26.10.2009 exploitation of unstable regions fuelling europe 's drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's instability feeds europe 's heroin habit the escalating instability in afghanistan , corruption and war in africa , organized crime in central asia and eastern europe , and cartel wars in latin america are all contributing to the flow of illegal drugs into europe . new figures on the state of the drugs problem in europe will be released by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in the first week of november .
the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.10.2009 leverkusen 's kiessling is becoming impossible for loew to ignore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the signs for kiessling are pointing up with klose , gomez and podolski out of sorts , the door is open for other german forwards .
but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .

local authorities reported that maksharip aushev was driving near the town of nalchik in the nearby region of kabardion-balkaria when his car was sprayed with automatic-weapon fire .
the attack also seriously wounded a passenger .
according to the opposition website , the attack took place on a main road , but the full circumstances remained unclear .
aushev was a strong critic of the region 's former president , murat zyayikov , and had led protests to publicize human rights abuses allegedly committed by government security forces .

with the country facing its worst economic crisis since the end of communism , the government is eager to cash in on this popular pastime . the proposed legislation would target the likes of 22-year-old poker player peter traply .
after winning 170,000 euros at a european poker event in monte carlo , he picked up a cool $ 348,000 -lrb- 230,000 euros -rrb- at this summer 's world series of poker in las vegas and became the first ever hungarian to pick up the competition 's coveted poker bracelet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online and offline poker is a hit in hungary " poker is really growing fast in hungary right now , ” he said .
“ and i think this winning really encourages it .
with even more players , poker will be even more popular than it is now . "
traply started playing the game online at the tender age of 18 “ as a joke ” and soon realized that it might be more lucrative than searching for a day job .
the former business student is not the only hungarian with lucky cards . former broker denes kalo , who is hungary 's number one player , has won some 1.6 million euros in the gambling craze .
businessmen turn to gambling hungary 's wealthiest man , real estate tycoon sandor demjan , was recently seen chasing a jackpot worth about 860,000 euros at the world series of poker europe .

“ i know that poker players say their situation is different because they view themselves as sportspeople , not as gamblers , like a casino .
parliament should determine the status of poker .
i expect that to happen soon . ”
in addition , under the proposed poker law a maximum of 10 poker tables would be allowed in a club and customers would only have to pay low entry fees to participate in a game .
legislation sparks controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker players say they are sportspeople not gamblers the hungarian poker association has warned these rules would mean the end of international competitions in hungary , and drive more people toward online games .
about a quarter of a million hungarians play poker , quite a lot for a nation with a population of 10 million , explained association president gergely tatar in a recent interview .
“ about 40,000 players go to clubs , the others play online . ”
instead of taxing poker winnings and introducing more regulation , tatar believes hungary should introduce a fixed tax per table , similar to the one in neighboring slovakia .
he estimates these measures would bring hungary tax revenues of around 1 million euros annually , as well as the venues ' corporate and labor taxes , and create one thousand jobs .
a group of hungarian men at a poker event in budapest appear in no mood to talk about a looming tax .

while hungary has got its sights set on poker , slovakia wants to crack down on bar owners who sell bootleg liquor and bulgaria plans to punish its many chain smokers by increasing tax on cigarettes by as much as 43 percent .
even beer drinkers are threatened .
the government of the czech republic - a country with one of the highest rates of beer consumption in the world - believes the time is right for new taxes on the czech 's favorite brew . from 2010 , the tax on beer , whether produced locally or imported , will rise 33 percent to 32 koruna -lrb- 1.23 euros -rrb- per 100 liters .
czech authorities also plan to raise tax on spirits next year .
if people continue to drink as they do now , the finance ministry expects the measures will raise 66 million euros in revenue in 2010 alone .
back in hungary , peter traply remains poker faced .
despite all these tax threats , he believes the future remains bright with “ many more hungarians ” putting their cards on the table in the hope of winning a big pay-off and the prestigious poker bracelet .

with the country facing its worst economic crisis since the end of communism , the government is eager to cash in on this popular pastime . the proposed legislation would target the likes of 22-year-old poker player peter traply .
after winning 170,000 euros at a european poker event in monte carlo , he picked up a cool $ 348,000 -lrb- 230,000 euros -rrb- at this summer 's world series of poker in las vegas and became the first ever hungarian to pick up the competition 's coveted poker bracelet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online and offline poker is a hit in hungary " poker is really growing fast in hungary right now , ” he said .
“ and i think this winning really encourages it .
with even more players , poker will be even more popular than it is now . "
traply started playing the game online at the tender age of 18 “ as a joke ” and soon realized that it might be more lucrative than searching for a day job .
the former business student is not the only hungarian with lucky cards . former broker denes kalo , who is hungary 's number one player , has won some 1.6 million euros in the gambling craze .
businessmen turn to gambling hungary 's wealthiest man , real estate tycoon sandor demjan , was recently seen chasing a jackpot worth about 860,000 euros at the world series of poker europe .
finance state secretary laszlo keller is now demanding his share of the money and wants to introduce a poker tax .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poker table can be a better bet than the stock market “ casinos are already paying concession fees to the state , ” he explained .
“ i know that poker players say their situation is different because they view themselves as sportspeople , not as gamblers , like a casino .
parliament should determine the status of poker .
i expect that to happen soon . ”
in addition , under the proposed poker law a maximum of 10 poker tables would be allowed in a club and customers would only have to pay low entry fees to participate in a game .
legislation sparks controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker players say they are sportspeople not gamblers the hungarian poker association has warned these rules would mean the end of international competitions in hungary , and drive more people toward online games .
about a quarter of a million hungarians play poker , quite a lot for a nation with a population of 10 million , explained association president gergely tatar in a recent interview .
“ about 40,000 players go to clubs , the others play online . ”
instead of taxing poker winnings and introducing more regulation , tatar believes hungary should introduce a fixed tax per table , similar to the one in neighboring slovakia .
he estimates these measures would bring hungary tax revenues of around 1 million euros annually , as well as the venues ' corporate and labor taxes , and create one thousand jobs .
a group of hungarian men at a poker event in budapest appear in no mood to talk about a looming tax .

while hungary has got its sights set on poker , slovakia wants to crack down on bar owners who sell bootleg liquor and bulgaria plans to punish its many chain smokers by increasing tax on cigarettes by as much as 43 percent .
even beer drinkers are threatened .
the government of the czech republic - a country with one of the highest rates of beer consumption in the world - believes the time is right for new taxes on the czech 's favorite brew . from 2010 , the tax on beer , whether produced locally or imported , will rise 33 percent to 32 koruna -lrb- 1.23 euros -rrb- per 100 liters .
czech authorities also plan to raise tax on spirits next year .
if people continue to drink as they do now , the finance ministry expects the measures will raise 66 million euros in revenue in 2010 alone .
back in hungary , peter traply remains poker faced .
despite all these tax threats , he believes the future remains bright with “ many more hungarians ” putting their cards on the table in the hope of winning a big pay-off and the prestigious poker bracelet .
" there are a lot of talented players in hungary .
so for sure i think within three years there will be another bracelet for hungary , for sure , " he said .

karadzic had announced in a letter on friday that he would not be attending the trial because he was insufficiently prepared .
judge o-gon kwon had originally acknowledged the absence of karadzic , and invited the prosecution to make its opening statement .
the panel of judges then abruptly adjourned the proceedings 15 minutes after they had begun and said the trial would recommence on tuesday 2:15 p.m. local time .
kwon said that if karadzic , who is representing himself , continued to be absent , judges would consider appointing a lawyer to represent him .
a member of karadzic 's legal team stressed however that his client " will never accept any imposed counsel " as demanded by the prosecution , which has argued it was the only way to stop karadzic 's efforts to " frustrate the proceedings . "
karadzic , 64 , faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 bosnian war that claimed the lives of some 100,000 people and displaced 2.2 million more .
he was arrested on a belgrade bus in july 2008 after being on the run for 13 years .
" mockery " of justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relatives of the victims of the srebrenica massacre protested outside the court relatives of the victims of the bosnian war reacted angrily at the news karadzic 's trial had been adjourned .
" it feels like they are being killed all over again , " said one woman who lost family in the july 1995 srebrenica massacre in which more than 8,000 muslim men and boys were murdered by members of the bosnian serb army .
" we do n't want karadzic to control our lives any more , " she said outside the hague court , where more than 100 mothers of victims of srebrenica protested monday morning , holding pictures of their dead sons .
" it is a mockery , " said jasna causevic , of the group society for threatened peoples , about karadzic 's boycott , adding he was trying to control the tribunal. dfm / mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic had announced in a letter on friday that he would not be attending the trial because he was insufficiently prepared .
judge o-gon kwon had originally acknowledged the absence of karadzic , and invited the prosecution to make its opening statement .
the panel of judges then abruptly adjourned the proceedings 15 minutes after they had begun and said the trial would recommence on tuesday 2:15 p.m. local time .
kwon said that if karadzic , who is representing himself , continued to be absent , judges would consider appointing a lawyer to represent him .
a member of karadzic 's legal team stressed however that his client " will never accept any imposed counsel " as demanded by the prosecution , which has argued it was the only way to stop karadzic 's efforts to " frustrate the proceedings . "
karadzic , 64 , faces 11 counts of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the 1992-95 bosnian war that claimed the lives of some 100,000 people and displaced 2.2 million more .
he was arrested on a belgrade bus in july 2008 after being on the run for 13 years .

" we do n't want karadzic to control our lives any more , " she said outside the hague court , where more than 100 mothers of victims of srebrenica protested monday morning , holding pictures of their dead sons .

trained as a lawyer , he is regarded as an economic expert .

" that is a strong signal from this national government to brussels . "
the move , announced after coalition talks between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats , drew criticism from oettinger 's opponents in the baden-wuerttemburg government .

oettinger is known for his ability to rattle off facts when challenged in his thick swabian accent , which often stymies german listeners .
he was also at the center of a 2007 controversy in which he eulogized his predecessor hans filbinger as " an opponent of nazism , " when filbinger was in fact part of a nazi judicial team that sentenced army deserters to death .
oettinger later distanced himself from his remarks .
a return to brussels for christian democrats it has been more than two decades since a christian democrat served as germany 's commissioner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 26.10.2009 leading human rights activist killed in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia can be dangerous for human rights activists a prominent human rights activist in russia 's southern province of ingushetia has been shot dead in at least the third killing of an opposition figure in the volatile north caucasus region in as many months . an opposition activist and businessman from russia 's ingushetia region in the country 's southwest was shot and killed in his car on sunday .
local authorities reported that maksharip aushev was driving near the town of nalchik in the nearby region of kabardion-balkaria when his car was sprayed with automatic-weapon fire .
the attack also seriously wounded a passenger .
according to the opposition website , the attack took place on a main road , but the full circumstances remained unclear .
aushev was a strong critic of the region 's former president , murat zyayikov , and had led protests to publicize human rights abuses allegedly committed by government security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natalya estemirova , a human rights activist , was murdered a few months ago colleagues of the slain activist are shocked and many have spoken out , including yunus-bek yevkorov , the kremlin appointee who took over the position of regional president a year ago .
in a statement on his website , yevkorov said the killing was an attempt to destabilize the situation in ingushetia and that he would personally take charge of the investigation .
alexander cherkasov , from the human rights group memorial , told echo of moscow radio that aushev had received threats and that in recent weeks he feared the secret services would take revenge .
attacks on the rise this is just the latest in an increasing number of attacks over the past few months in the north caucasus .
in july , natalya estemirova , a prominent human rights activist , was found shot dead in ingushetia .
a month later , zarema sadulayeva , a chechen woman who helped injured children , and her husband were kidnapped and killed .
the russian government has blamed the attacks on muslim insurgents , who it says are backed by foreign cash which threatens moscow 's control over the volatile southern region .
the worst hit areas have been dagestan , ingushetia and chechnya .
russia has fought two wars against chechen separatists since 1994 .
bildunterschrift : moscow has been having trouble maintaining control over the north caucasus since 1994 aushev had close ties with another prominent local opposition activist , magomed yevloyev , who was detained and killed by local police in august 2008 .
the website ingushetia.org , which aushev owned at one time , said the deaths of the two men were linked and that anyone who dared to speak against the authorities or speak the truth , is doomed to the fate shared by magomed and maksharip .
tatiana lochkina , director of human rights watch in moscow , agreed .
she told interfax that the killing " illustrates very clearly the atmosphere of impunity " in the region .
she added that participating in opposition politics or defending basic freedoms in the north caucasus has become " almost a form of suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 26.10.2009 exploitation of unstable regions fuelling europe 's drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's instability feeds europe 's heroin habit the escalating instability in afghanistan , corruption and war in africa , organized crime in central asia and eastern europe , and cartel wars in latin america are all contributing to the flow of illegal drugs into europe . new figures on the state of the drugs problem in europe will be released by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in the first week of november .
the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .
" we will have to wait and see whether violence will actually have an effect on the supply , but we have n't seen any signs of less cocaine reaching the us .

the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .

local authorities reported that maksharip aushev was driving near the town of nalchik in the nearby region of kabardion-balkaria when his car was sprayed with automatic-weapon fire .
the attack also seriously wounded a passenger .
according to the opposition website , the attack took place on a main road , but the full circumstances remained unclear .
aushev was a strong critic of the region 's former president , murat zyayikov , and had led protests to publicize human rights abuses allegedly committed by government security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natalya estemirova , a human rights activist , was murdered a few months ago colleagues of the slain activist are shocked and many have spoken out , including yunus-bek yevkorov , the kremlin appointee who took over the position of regional president a year ago .
in a statement on his website , yevkorov said the killing was an attempt to destabilize the situation in ingushetia and that he would personally take charge of the investigation .
alexander cherkasov , from the human rights group memorial , told echo of moscow radio that aushev had received threats and that in recent weeks he feared the secret services would take revenge .
attacks on the rise this is just the latest in an increasing number of attacks over the past few months in the north caucasus .
in july , natalya estemirova , a prominent human rights activist , was found shot dead in ingushetia .
a month later , zarema sadulayeva , a chechen woman who helped injured children , and her husband were kidnapped and killed .
the russian government has blamed the attacks on muslim insurgents , who it says are backed by foreign cash which threatens moscow 's control over the volatile southern region .
the worst hit areas have been dagestan , ingushetia and chechnya .
russia has fought two wars against chechen separatists since 1994 .
bildunterschrift : moscow has been having trouble maintaining control over the north caucasus since 1994 aushev had close ties with another prominent local opposition activist , magomed yevloyev , who was detained and killed by local police in august 2008 .
the website ingushetia.org , which aushev owned at one time , said the deaths of the two men were linked and that anyone who dared to speak against the authorities or speak the truth , is doomed to the fate shared by magomed and maksharip .
tatiana lochkina , director of human rights watch in moscow , agreed .
she told interfax that the killing " illustrates very clearly the atmosphere of impunity " in the region .
she added that participating in opposition politics or defending basic freedoms in the north caucasus has become " almost a form of suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.10.2009 leverkusen 's kiessling is becoming impossible for loew to ignore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the signs for kiessling are pointing up with klose , gomez and podolski out of sorts , the door is open for other german forwards .
but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 26.10.2009 exploitation of unstable regions fuelling europe 's drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's instability feeds europe 's heroin habit the escalating instability in afghanistan , corruption and war in africa , organized crime in central asia and eastern europe , and cartel wars in latin america are all contributing to the flow of illegal drugs into europe . new figures on the state of the drugs problem in europe will be released by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in the first week of november .
the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .
" we will have to wait and see whether violence will actually have an effect on the supply , but we have n't seen any signs of less cocaine reaching the us .

the bosnian serb wartime leader is accused of genocide and war crimes . it was october 14 , 1991 .
yugoslavia had already fallen apart and fighting was rampant across croatia .
in the parliament of bosnia and herzegovina , the serb leader radovan karadzic stepped up to the lectern .
he then proceeded to issue a threat to muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats , who wanted to become independent from the serb-dominated remainder of the multi-ethnic state .
" consider that you could thereby lead bosnia and herzegovina to hell and perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation , " karadzic told the parliament .
" if there is war here , the muslim people will not be able to defend themselves . "
shortly thereafter , in the spring of 1992 , the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war two broke out in bosnia .
more than 110,000 people died , over a million were temporarily displaced .
for three-and-a-half years , the serbs shelled the beleaguered capital sarajevo with grenades .
snipers were also in action .
the sad climax came before the end of the war in 1995 : the execution of almost 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the scene of the largest mass murder in europe since world war two no mercy for karadzic in numerous concentration camps , women were massively raped and men beaten to death .
" i was heavily injured on my torso and stomach , " said murat tahirovic , who survived the abuse .
" the stomach wound was kept open and my torturers stuck a police baton in it .
i was beaten , several teeth were knocked out .
i was offended , mentally tortured , was n't allowed to use the toilet .
and you could n't wash yourself anyway . "
tahirovic was in his mid-20s at the time and a soldier in the bosniak army .
he was taken captive and put in a camp near the border to croatia .
after two months , the former mining engineer was freed .
today , he still suffers from constant pain and the pictures from then continue to haunt him .
in retrospect , tahirovic , who heads an association of former bosniak concentration camp detainees , said he does n't bear a grudge against his direct tormentors .
" they were too young at the time , manipulated by the media and put under pressure , " tahirovic said .
" in some respects , i forgive them . " but those who instructed the deeds , who were aware of the torture , they could not be forgiven , he said .
this was particularly the case for karadzic .
guilt confirmed the charges against karadzic at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia total 11 points .
numerous previous judgments by the tribunal in the hague confirm that the crimes occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic pleaded not guilty at the un yugoslav war crimes tribunal mirsad tokaca , head of the war crimes research and documentation center in sarajevo , said the evidence against karadzic was overwhelming .
there could be no doubt of his guilt in the brutal human rights violations by the serbs in bosnia against muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats .
tokaca said karadzic triggered the war and knew he could count on slobodan milosevic , the nationalist and authoritarian president of serbia at the time .
" karadzic knew that belgrade and serbia were behind him , the milosevic regime and the yugoslav army , " tokaca said .
" the crimes which are considered key events were committed in april , may and in part june and july of 1992 .
at this time , the yugoslavian army was fighting for karadzic 's ideas with force of arms . "
tokaca has even delivered evidence of this : audio recordings from sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : the bosnian capital sarajevo suffered great destruction during the war karadzic was milosevic 's political protege and war ally .
the tribunal 's prosecutors are of the view that milosevic and karadzic and other serbian politicians and officers wanted to use the collapse of yugoslavia to forcibly take over those areas in croatia and bosnia inhabited by serbs .
from a hobby poet to a miracle healer milosevic died during his trial in the hague .
just as he did , karadzic is defending himself before the tribunal and expected to use the courtroom as a political stage .
the psychiatrist senadin ljubovic , who helps bosnian war victims , said karadzic is convinced that he acted correctly .
" he 'll even say he was forced to order the murder of those many people , " ljubovic said .
" he had warned them beforehand but they did n't want to listen to him .
i do n't think that he 'll ever show remorse . "
ljubovic was karadzic 's mentor .
he introduced the then young student to psychiatry at the clinic in sarajevo .
the hobby poet karadzic came to the bosnian capital with his parents from the montenegrin mountains .
later , he was prosecuted for embezzlement but never went to prison thanks to his unofficial collaboration with the intelligence service .
at the beginning of the war in bosnia , the nationalist was elected serbian president .
after the end of the war and arraignment , karadzic disappeared and was on the run for more than 13 years .
when he was caught last summer , he worked as a miracle healer in serbia 's capital belgrade .
since then , he 's been in custody in the hague .
karadzic is being held responsible for murder , torture and displacement during the balkan war 15 years ago .
he denies any guilt .
according to jurists , he can expect a lifelong sentence if convicted .

with the country facing its worst economic crisis since the end of communism , the government is eager to cash in on this popular pastime . the proposed legislation would target the likes of 22-year-old poker player peter traply .
after winning 170,000 euros at a european poker event in monte carlo , he picked up a cool $ 348,000 -lrb- 230,000 euros -rrb- at this summer 's world series of poker in las vegas and became the first ever hungarian to pick up the competition 's coveted poker bracelet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online and offline poker is a hit in hungary " poker is really growing fast in hungary right now , ” he said .
“ and i think this winning really encourages it .
with even more players , poker will be even more popular than it is now . "
traply started playing the game online at the tender age of 18 “ as a joke ” and soon realized that it might be more lucrative than searching for a day job .
the former business student is not the only hungarian with lucky cards . former broker denes kalo , who is hungary 's number one player , has won some 1.6 million euros in the gambling craze .
businessmen turn to gambling hungary 's wealthiest man , real estate tycoon sandor demjan , was recently seen chasing a jackpot worth about 860,000 euros at the world series of poker europe .
finance state secretary laszlo keller is now demanding his share of the money and wants to introduce a poker tax .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poker table can be a better bet than the stock market “ casinos are already paying concession fees to the state , ” he explained .
“ i know that poker players say their situation is different because they view themselves as sportspeople , not as gamblers , like a casino .
parliament should determine the status of poker .
i expect that to happen soon . ”
in addition , under the proposed poker law a maximum of 10 poker tables would be allowed in a club and customers would only have to pay low entry fees to participate in a game .
legislation sparks controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker players say they are sportspeople not gamblers the hungarian poker association has warned these rules would mean the end of international competitions in hungary , and drive more people toward online games .
about a quarter of a million hungarians play poker , quite a lot for a nation with a population of 10 million , explained association president gergely tatar in a recent interview .
“ about 40,000 players go to clubs , the others play online . ”
instead of taxing poker winnings and introducing more regulation , tatar believes hungary should introduce a fixed tax per table , similar to the one in neighboring slovakia .
he estimates these measures would bring hungary tax revenues of around 1 million euros annually , as well as the venues ' corporate and labor taxes , and create one thousand jobs .
a group of hungarian men at a poker event in budapest appear in no mood to talk about a looming tax .
accented shouts of “ call ” , “ deal ” and “ cut ” reverberate throughout the room .
all eyes are on the hands of a young woman in charge of dealing the cards that may make them rich . recent years have seen hundreds of unregulated poker clubs spring up in hungary .

while hungary has got its sights set on poker , slovakia wants to crack down on bar owners who sell bootleg liquor and bulgaria plans to punish its many chain smokers by increasing tax on cigarettes by as much as 43 percent .
even beer drinkers are threatened .
the government of the czech republic - a country with one of the highest rates of beer consumption in the world - believes the time is right for new taxes on the czech 's favorite brew . from 2010 , the tax on beer , whether produced locally or imported , will rise 33 percent to 32 koruna -lrb- 1.23 euros -rrb- per 100 liters .
czech authorities also plan to raise tax on spirits next year .
if people continue to drink as they do now , the finance ministry expects the measures will raise 66 million euros in revenue in 2010 alone .
back in hungary , peter traply remains poker faced .
despite all these tax threats , he believes the future remains bright with “ many more hungarians ” putting their cards on the table in the hope of winning a big pay-off and the prestigious poker bracelet .
" there are a lot of talented players in hungary .
so for sure i think within three years there will be another bracelet for hungary , for sure , " he said .
and , if the hungarian government has its way , there 'll be a tax collector looking over their shoulders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 26.10.2009 hungarian government eager for share of poker pot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budapest is hoping to get lucky with poker hungary is planning a law that would tax poker winnings and regulate clubs .
with the country facing its worst economic crisis since the end of communism , the government is eager to cash in on this popular pastime . the proposed legislation would target the likes of 22-year-old poker player peter traply .
after winning 170,000 euros at a european poker event in monte carlo , he picked up a cool $ 348,000 -lrb- 230,000 euros -rrb- at this summer 's world series of poker in las vegas and became the first ever hungarian to pick up the competition 's coveted poker bracelet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online and offline poker is a hit in hungary " poker is really growing fast in hungary right now , ” he said .
“ and i think this winning really encourages it .
with even more players , poker will be even more popular than it is now . "
traply started playing the game online at the tender age of 18 “ as a joke ” and soon realized that it might be more lucrative than searching for a day job .
the former business student is not the only hungarian with lucky cards . former broker denes kalo , who is hungary 's number one player , has won some 1.6 million euros in the gambling craze .
businessmen turn to gambling hungary 's wealthiest man , real estate tycoon sandor demjan , was recently seen chasing a jackpot worth about 860,000 euros at the world series of poker europe .
finance state secretary laszlo keller is now demanding his share of the money and wants to introduce a poker tax .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the poker table can be a better bet than the stock market “ casinos are already paying concession fees to the state , ” he explained .
“ i know that poker players say their situation is different because they view themselves as sportspeople , not as gamblers , like a casino .
parliament should determine the status of poker .
i expect that to happen soon . ”
in addition , under the proposed poker law a maximum of 10 poker tables would be allowed in a club and customers would only have to pay low entry fees to participate in a game .
legislation sparks controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker players say they are sportspeople not gamblers the hungarian poker association has warned these rules would mean the end of international competitions in hungary , and drive more people toward online games .
about a quarter of a million hungarians play poker , quite a lot for a nation with a population of 10 million , explained association president gergely tatar in a recent interview .
“ about 40,000 players go to clubs , the others play online . ”
instead of taxing poker winnings and introducing more regulation , tatar believes hungary should introduce a fixed tax per table , similar to the one in neighboring slovakia .
he estimates these measures would bring hungary tax revenues of around 1 million euros annually , as well as the venues ' corporate and labor taxes , and create one thousand jobs .
a group of hungarian men at a poker event in budapest appear in no mood to talk about a looming tax .
accented shouts of “ call ” , “ deal ” and “ cut ” reverberate throughout the room .
all eyes are on the hands of a young woman in charge of dealing the cards that may make them rich . recent years have seen hundreds of unregulated poker clubs spring up in hungary .
the hungarian poker association would like to see these establishments continue to thrive .
eastern europe trend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other " vices " are also being targeted in eastern europe hungary is not the only country to contemplate so-called " sin taxes " to boost public financing .
while hungary has got its sights set on poker , slovakia wants to crack down on bar owners who sell bootleg liquor and bulgaria plans to punish its many chain smokers by increasing tax on cigarettes by as much as 43 percent .
even beer drinkers are threatened .
the government of the czech republic - a country with one of the highest rates of beer consumption in the world - believes the time is right for new taxes on the czech 's favorite brew . from 2010 , the tax on beer , whether produced locally or imported , will rise 33 percent to 32 koruna -lrb- 1.23 euros -rrb- per 100 liters .
czech authorities also plan to raise tax on spirits next year .
if people continue to drink as they do now , the finance ministry expects the measures will raise 66 million euros in revenue in 2010 alone .
back in hungary , peter traply remains poker faced .
despite all these tax threats , he believes the future remains bright with “ many more hungarians ” putting their cards on the table in the hope of winning a big pay-off and the prestigious poker bracelet .
" there are a lot of talented players in hungary .
so for sure i think within three years there will be another bracelet for hungary , for sure , " he said .
and , if the hungarian government has its way , there 'll be a tax collector looking over their shoulders .

trained as a lawyer , he is regarded as an economic expert .
" we need a strong personality in brussels that has the economic policy experience , and knows what 's important in our country , " said volker kauder , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group .
" that is a strong signal from this national government to brussels . "
the move , announced after coalition talks between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats , drew criticism from oettinger 's opponents in the baden-wuerttemburg government .
the social democrats said merkel was simply " withdrawing a beleaguered premier from circulation . "
green party politician juergen trittin said oettinger had proven himself to be a less than enthusiastic supporter of european integration .
far left party die linke has called for new state elections .
the christian democrats in baden-wuerttemburg suffered significant losses in state polls earlier this year , despite being the dominant party since 1953 .
they won only 34.4 percent of the party vote , a 5 percent drop compared to the 2005 election results .
oettinger is known for his ability to rattle off facts when challenged in his thick swabian accent , which often stymies german listeners .
he was also at the center of a 2007 controversy in which he eulogized his predecessor hans filbinger as " an opponent of nazism , " when filbinger was in fact part of a nazi judicial team that sentenced army deserters to death .
oettinger later distanced himself from his remarks .
a return to brussels for christian democrats it has been more than two decades since a christian democrat served as germany 's commissioner .
the last was karl-heinz narjes , who served from 1981-1988 .
oettinger would replace social democrat guenther verheugen , who has served as commissioner since 1999 and as the body 's vice president since 2004 .
his current term officially ends on october 31 .
there is one eu commissioner for each member country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 26.10.2009 ramifications of karadzic trial go far beyond legal realm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former bosnian serb leader claims to have immunity from prosecution the trial against wartime bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic at the un war crimes tribunal is expected to be tedious and difficult .
but its significance ca n't be overestimated , say international law experts . radovan karadzic did not appear in court at the start of his genocide trial on monday .
his legal adviser had reiterated on sunday that his client would not be present because un war crimes judges had not given him time to prepare his defense .
the move comes after repeated previous requests to delay the trial and is a sign that the court proceedings in the hague wo n't be easy .
by boycotting the opening of the trial , karadzic , who was arrested last year after 11 years on the run , is increasing the pressure on presiding judge o-gon kwon .
" he does n't necessarily need to show up , if he waives his right to be present , the trial might go in absentia , but it 's very difficult from a procedural aspect to continue a trial without the accused being present , " christoph safferling , director of the research and documentation center for war crimes trials at the philipps-university marburg , said .
karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian conflict karadzic , who faces life in prison if convicted , may not need to attend the trial from a legal point of view .
but experts say his absence could make it harder for the court to conduct a fair and impartial trial .
" the judge has to give the accused room to also interpret and question and give his own view of things and the allegations , so it will be very very difficult for the judges to handle this situation indeed , " safferling said .
kai ambos , who heads the department for foreign and international criminal law at the georg august university goettingen , said that karadzic , like two other prominent serbian leaders indicted by the un court- slobodan milosevic and vojislav seselj - is trying to mount a political defense .
" he 's not interested in having a rapid , quick trial that really treats the matters for which he was indicted . "
as part of his strategy , karadzic , who is not a lawyer , but a trained psychiatrist , has announced that he will defend himself before the tribunal .
" it 's his right to defend himself so one has to accept that , " safferling said .
but he added that the tactic is a potential stumbling block for the court .
" history tells us this is always a very difficult situation for the judges if an accused defends himself .
we have seen that with milosevic who has chosen to defend himself and also with seselj at the yugoslav tribunal , whose trial is still going on and he is defending himself and puts a major challenge to the judges . "
defense team while karadzic said publicly that he will defend himself , that claim should not be taken literally , argued ambos : " it 's a kind of hypocrital statement to say i 'm defending myself . "
karadzic , like milosevic and others , has a sizeable legal team working on his behalf in the background .
" so in fact they are connected with a group of defense lawyers and these defense lawyers consult them , so de facto they have a defense , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was indicted for his role in the bosnian war the most well known aspect of karadzic 's political defense strategy is probably his oft repeated claim that he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution as part of a deal he struck in 1996 with us negotiator richard holbrooke .
therefore he should be exempt from trial .
according to karadzic , he agreed to resign from political life in exchange for having the war crimes charges against him dropped .
holbrooke , a former ambassador to germany and currently us special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , has denied the deal .
while there are some indications and statements by people involved in the negotiations back then suggesting that there might have been a political deal , that still would n't change the situation .
whether a deal was struck or not , karadzic has no claim to immunity , legal experts say .
" holbrooke or any other politician who negotiated in dayton or before and after dayton can not speak for the tribunal , " argued ambos .
" they are not organs of the tribunal and they can not give immunity to a person sought by the tribunal . "
he added : " even the correctly understood immunity rules which we accept in international law would not apply before an international criminal tribunal . "
no immunity his colleague concurred : " if you take international criminal justice seriously you ca n't grant immunity to anyone of that official and political standing , " said safferling .
he admitted that distinctions between political and legal solutions of conflicts often become blurred , but that in order to further establish the still nascent area of international criminal law it is imperative to draw a line .
" legally speaking you can not accept this .
there are allegations of criminal conduct and you have to prosecute this criminal conduct .
there is no question and immunities do n't play a role in this regard . "
both experts argued that the relevance of the karadzic trial can not be overestimated .
its significance is proven by the fact that the number of charges against karadzic was scaled down in negotiations between the prosecutors and the chamber in order to finish the trial in the foreseeable future , " because nobody wants to go through the same experience of a defendent who dies during the trial , " argued ambos , refering to milosevic who died during the proceedings .
he added that it is important for both the defendent and the people of bosnia-herzegovina that the alleged crimes carried out in the name of karadzic and the ideology of a greater serbia are investigated thoroughly during this trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief prosecutor serge brammertz has prepared the case against karadzic " this is very much a test case for international criminal justice and for the yugloslav tribunal as it is , " said safferling .
" so it is absolutely essential that there is a proper trial against karadzic . "
the challenge for the judges is enormous and goes far beyond the legal realm .
" if it is not guaranteed that it is a fair trial and the outcome is sort of acceptable to all the groups it might well be that the conflict erupts again in one way or the other , " argued safferling .
" everybody on the territory of the former yugoslavia will look at this trial and monitor what is going on in the hague very closely . "

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .
" we will have to wait and see whether violence will actually have an effect on the supply , but we have n't seen any signs of less cocaine reaching the us .

but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .
" we will have to wait and see whether violence will actually have an effect on the supply , but we have n't seen any signs of less cocaine reaching the us .

the planned reform of the healthcare system shows in what direction this is heading : social security will be increasingly privatized , the principle of a mutually supportive insured community will be compromised .
the planned restructuring of the health insurance system , due to start in 2011 , requires that any future increase in contributions will be paid for by the employee , not the employer .
on top of this , people will be legally obliged to take on additional private long-term care insurance .
this will please insurance companies - they will get millions of new contracts .
but a shudder might go through those who pay insurance premiums when they think of the millions of pensioners in the us who were plunged into poverty by the financial crisis and the recklessness of insurance companies after having paid into funded pension insurance systems .
so does this represent a permanent switch from the german contribution system based on fiscal parity to an american-style capital funded system ?
will the re-structuring of society , begun under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left government and continued under merkel 's grand coalition , finally be cemented ?
will the redistribution from the bottom up , a process that has incontrovertibly happened in the past few years , be continued ?
the coalition partners who cheerfully sat before the press on saturday morning carefully avoided any impression that their government would be one of social neglect .
they believe in social justice , they said , and they want to remove all remaining social inequalities .
these are the promises with which the cdu-fdp coalition has entered government .
now they must be measured on how they honor these promises .
we can only hope for an effective opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 26.10.2009 ramifications of karadzic trial go far beyond legal realm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former bosnian serb leader claims to have immunity from prosecution the trial against wartime bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic at the un war crimes tribunal is expected to be tedious and difficult .
but its significance ca n't be overestimated , say international law experts . radovan karadzic did not appear in court at the start of his genocide trial on monday .
his legal adviser had reiterated on sunday that his client would not be present because un war crimes judges had not given him time to prepare his defense .
the move comes after repeated previous requests to delay the trial and is a sign that the court proceedings in the hague wo n't be easy .
by boycotting the opening of the trial , karadzic , who was arrested last year after 11 years on the run , is increasing the pressure on presiding judge o-gon kwon .
" he does n't necessarily need to show up , if he waives his right to be present , the trial might go in absentia , but it 's very difficult from a procedural aspect to continue a trial without the accused being present , " christoph safferling , director of the research and documentation center for war crimes trials at the philipps-university marburg , said .
karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian conflict karadzic , who faces life in prison if convicted , may not need to attend the trial from a legal point of view .
but experts say his absence could make it harder for the court to conduct a fair and impartial trial .
" the judge has to give the accused room to also interpret and question and give his own view of things and the allegations , so it will be very very difficult for the judges to handle this situation indeed , " safferling said .
kai ambos , who heads the department for foreign and international criminal law at the georg august university goettingen , said that karadzic , like two other prominent serbian leaders indicted by the un court- slobodan milosevic and vojislav seselj - is trying to mount a political defense .
" he 's not interested in having a rapid , quick trial that really treats the matters for which he was indicted . "
as part of his strategy , karadzic , who is not a lawyer , but a trained psychiatrist , has announced that he will defend himself before the tribunal .
" it 's his right to defend himself so one has to accept that , " safferling said .
but he added that the tactic is a potential stumbling block for the court .
" history tells us this is always a very difficult situation for the judges if an accused defends himself .
we have seen that with milosevic who has chosen to defend himself and also with seselj at the yugoslav tribunal , whose trial is still going on and he is defending himself and puts a major challenge to the judges . "
defense team while karadzic said publicly that he will defend himself , that claim should not be taken literally , argued ambos : " it 's a kind of hypocrital statement to say i 'm defending myself . "
karadzic , like milosevic and others , has a sizeable legal team working on his behalf in the background .
" so in fact they are connected with a group of defense lawyers and these defense lawyers consult them , so de facto they have a defense , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was indicted for his role in the bosnian war the most well known aspect of karadzic 's political defense strategy is probably his oft repeated claim that he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution as part of a deal he struck in 1996 with us negotiator richard holbrooke .
therefore he should be exempt from trial .
according to karadzic , he agreed to resign from political life in exchange for having the war crimes charges against him dropped .
holbrooke , a former ambassador to germany and currently us special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , has denied the deal .
while there are some indications and statements by people involved in the negotiations back then suggesting that there might have been a political deal , that still would n't change the situation .
whether a deal was struck or not , karadzic has no claim to immunity , legal experts say .
" holbrooke or any other politician who negotiated in dayton or before and after dayton can not speak for the tribunal , " argued ambos .
" they are not organs of the tribunal and they can not give immunity to a person sought by the tribunal . "
he added : " even the correctly understood immunity rules which we accept in international law would not apply before an international criminal tribunal . "
no immunity his colleague concurred : " if you take international criminal justice seriously you ca n't grant immunity to anyone of that official and political standing , " said safferling .
he admitted that distinctions between political and legal solutions of conflicts often become blurred , but that in order to further establish the still nascent area of international criminal law it is imperative to draw a line .
" legally speaking you can not accept this .
there are allegations of criminal conduct and you have to prosecute this criminal conduct .
there is no question and immunities do n't play a role in this regard . "
both experts argued that the relevance of the karadzic trial can not be overestimated .
its significance is proven by the fact that the number of charges against karadzic was scaled down in negotiations between the prosecutors and the chamber in order to finish the trial in the foreseeable future , " because nobody wants to go through the same experience of a defendent who dies during the trial , " argued ambos , refering to milosevic who died during the proceedings .
he added that it is important for both the defendent and the people of bosnia-herzegovina that the alleged crimes carried out in the name of karadzic and the ideology of a greater serbia are investigated thoroughly during this trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief prosecutor serge brammertz has prepared the case against karadzic " this is very much a test case for international criminal justice and for the yugloslav tribunal as it is , " said safferling .
" so it is absolutely essential that there is a proper trial against karadzic . "
the challenge for the judges is enormous and goes far beyond the legal realm .
" if it is not guaranteed that it is a fair trial and the outcome is sort of acceptable to all the groups it might well be that the conflict erupts again in one way or the other , " argued safferling .
" everybody on the territory of the former yugoslavia will look at this trial and monitor what is going on in the hague very closely . "

but its significance ca n't be overestimated , say international law experts . radovan karadzic did not appear in court at the start of his genocide trial on monday .
his legal adviser had reiterated on sunday that his client would not be present because un war crimes judges had not given him time to prepare his defense .
the move comes after repeated previous requests to delay the trial and is a sign that the court proceedings in the hague wo n't be easy .
by boycotting the opening of the trial , karadzic , who was arrested last year after 11 years on the run , is increasing the pressure on presiding judge o-gon kwon .
" he does n't necessarily need to show up , if he waives his right to be present , the trial might go in absentia , but it 's very difficult from a procedural aspect to continue a trial without the accused being present , " christoph safferling , director of the research and documentation center for war crimes trials at the philipps-university marburg , said .
karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian conflict karadzic , who faces life in prison if convicted , may not need to attend the trial from a legal point of view .
but experts say his absence could make it harder for the court to conduct a fair and impartial trial .
" the judge has to give the accused room to also interpret and question and give his own view of things and the allegations , so it will be very very difficult for the judges to handle this situation indeed , " safferling said .
kai ambos , who heads the department for foreign and international criminal law at the georg august university goettingen , said that karadzic , like two other prominent serbian leaders indicted by the un court- slobodan milosevic and vojislav seselj - is trying to mount a political defense .
" he 's not interested in having a rapid , quick trial that really treats the matters for which he was indicted . "
as part of his strategy , karadzic , who is not a lawyer , but a trained psychiatrist , has announced that he will defend himself before the tribunal .
" it 's his right to defend himself so one has to accept that , " safferling said .
but he added that the tactic is a potential stumbling block for the court .
" history tells us this is always a very difficult situation for the judges if an accused defends himself .
we have seen that with milosevic who has chosen to defend himself and also with seselj at the yugoslav tribunal , whose trial is still going on and he is defending himself and puts a major challenge to the judges . "
defense team while karadzic said publicly that he will defend himself , that claim should not be taken literally , argued ambos : " it 's a kind of hypocrital statement to say i 'm defending myself . "
karadzic , like milosevic and others , has a sizeable legal team working on his behalf in the background .
" so in fact they are connected with a group of defense lawyers and these defense lawyers consult them , so de facto they have a defense , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was indicted for his role in the bosnian war the most well known aspect of karadzic 's political defense strategy is probably his oft repeated claim that he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution as part of a deal he struck in 1996 with us negotiator richard holbrooke .

the bosnian serb wartime leader is accused of genocide and war crimes . it was october 14 , 1991 .
yugoslavia had already fallen apart and fighting was rampant across croatia .
in the parliament of bosnia and herzegovina , the serb leader radovan karadzic stepped up to the lectern .
he then proceeded to issue a threat to muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats , who wanted to become independent from the serb-dominated remainder of the multi-ethnic state .
" consider that you could thereby lead bosnia and herzegovina to hell and perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation , " karadzic told the parliament .
" if there is war here , the muslim people will not be able to defend themselves . "
shortly thereafter , in the spring of 1992 , the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war two broke out in bosnia .
more than 110,000 people died , over a million were temporarily displaced .
for three-and-a-half years , the serbs shelled the beleaguered capital sarajevo with grenades .
snipers were also in action .
the sad climax came before the end of the war in 1995 : the execution of almost 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the scene of the largest mass murder in europe since world war two no mercy for karadzic in numerous concentration camps , women were massively raped and men beaten to death .
" i was heavily injured on my torso and stomach , " said murat tahirovic , who survived the abuse .
" the stomach wound was kept open and my torturers stuck a police baton in it .
i was beaten , several teeth were knocked out .
i was offended , mentally tortured , was n't allowed to use the toilet .
and you could n't wash yourself anyway . "
tahirovic was in his mid-20s at the time and a soldier in the bosniak army .
he was taken captive and put in a camp near the border to croatia .
after two months , the former mining engineer was freed .
today , he still suffers from constant pain and the pictures from then continue to haunt him .
in retrospect , tahirovic , who heads an association of former bosniak concentration camp detainees , said he does n't bear a grudge against his direct tormentors .
" they were too young at the time , manipulated by the media and put under pressure , " tahirovic said .
" in some respects , i forgive them . " but those who instructed the deeds , who were aware of the torture , they could not be forgiven , he said .
this was particularly the case for karadzic .
guilt confirmed the charges against karadzic at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia total 11 points .
numerous previous judgments by the tribunal in the hague confirm that the crimes occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic pleaded not guilty at the un yugoslav war crimes tribunal mirsad tokaca , head of the war crimes research and documentation center in sarajevo , said the evidence against karadzic was overwhelming .
there could be no doubt of his guilt in the brutal human rights violations by the serbs in bosnia against muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats .
tokaca said karadzic triggered the war and knew he could count on slobodan milosevic , the nationalist and authoritarian president of serbia at the time .
" karadzic knew that belgrade and serbia were behind him , the milosevic regime and the yugoslav army , " tokaca said .
" the crimes which are considered key events were committed in april , may and in part june and july of 1992 .
at this time , the yugoslavian army was fighting for karadzic 's ideas with force of arms . "
tokaca has even delivered evidence of this : audio recordings from sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : the bosnian capital sarajevo suffered great destruction during the war karadzic was milosevic 's political protege and war ally .
the tribunal 's prosecutors are of the view that milosevic and karadzic and other serbian politicians and officers wanted to use the collapse of yugoslavia to forcibly take over those areas in croatia and bosnia inhabited by serbs .
from a hobby poet to a miracle healer milosevic died during his trial in the hague .
just as he did , karadzic is defending himself before the tribunal and expected to use the courtroom as a political stage .
the psychiatrist senadin ljubovic , who helps bosnian war victims , said karadzic is convinced that he acted correctly .
" he 'll even say he was forced to order the murder of those many people , " ljubovic said .
" he had warned them beforehand but they did n't want to listen to him .
i do n't think that he 'll ever show remorse . "
ljubovic was karadzic 's mentor .
he introduced the then young student to psychiatry at the clinic in sarajevo .
the hobby poet karadzic came to the bosnian capital with his parents from the montenegrin mountains .
later , he was prosecuted for embezzlement but never went to prison thanks to his unofficial collaboration with the intelligence service .
at the beginning of the war in bosnia , the nationalist was elected serbian president .
after the end of the war and arraignment , karadzic disappeared and was on the run for more than 13 years .
when he was caught last summer , he worked as a miracle healer in serbia 's capital belgrade .
since then , he 's been in custody in the hague .
karadzic is being held responsible for murder , torture and displacement during the balkan war 15 years ago .
he denies any guilt .
according to jurists , he can expect a lifelong sentence if convicted .

but its significance ca n't be overestimated , say international law experts . radovan karadzic did not appear in court at the start of his genocide trial on monday .
his legal adviser had reiterated on sunday that his client would not be present because un war crimes judges had not given him time to prepare his defense .
the move comes after repeated previous requests to delay the trial and is a sign that the court proceedings in the hague wo n't be easy .
by boycotting the opening of the trial , karadzic , who was arrested last year after 11 years on the run , is increasing the pressure on presiding judge o-gon kwon .
" he does n't necessarily need to show up , if he waives his right to be present , the trial might go in absentia , but it 's very difficult from a procedural aspect to continue a trial without the accused being present , " christoph safferling , director of the research and documentation center for war crimes trials at the philipps-university marburg , said .
karadzic is charged with 11 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the bosnian conflict karadzic , who faces life in prison if convicted , may not need to attend the trial from a legal point of view .
but experts say his absence could make it harder for the court to conduct a fair and impartial trial .
" the judge has to give the accused room to also interpret and question and give his own view of things and the allegations , so it will be very very difficult for the judges to handle this situation indeed , " safferling said .
kai ambos , who heads the department for foreign and international criminal law at the georg august university goettingen , said that karadzic , like two other prominent serbian leaders indicted by the un court- slobodan milosevic and vojislav seselj - is trying to mount a political defense .
" he 's not interested in having a rapid , quick trial that really treats the matters for which he was indicted . "
as part of his strategy , karadzic , who is not a lawyer , but a trained psychiatrist , has announced that he will defend himself before the tribunal .
" it 's his right to defend himself so one has to accept that , " safferling said .
but he added that the tactic is a potential stumbling block for the court .
" history tells us this is always a very difficult situation for the judges if an accused defends himself .
we have seen that with milosevic who has chosen to defend himself and also with seselj at the yugoslav tribunal , whose trial is still going on and he is defending himself and puts a major challenge to the judges . "
defense team while karadzic said publicly that he will defend himself , that claim should not be taken literally , argued ambos : " it 's a kind of hypocrital statement to say i 'm defending myself . "
karadzic , like milosevic and others , has a sizeable legal team working on his behalf in the background .
" so in fact they are connected with a group of defense lawyers and these defense lawyers consult them , so de facto they have a defense , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : radovan karadzic was indicted for his role in the bosnian war the most well known aspect of karadzic 's political defense strategy is probably his oft repeated claim that he was guaranteed immunity from prosecution as part of a deal he struck in 1996 with us negotiator richard holbrooke .
therefore he should be exempt from trial .
according to karadzic , he agreed to resign from political life in exchange for having the war crimes charges against him dropped .
holbrooke , a former ambassador to germany and currently us special representative for afghanistan and pakistan , has denied the deal .
while there are some indications and statements by people involved in the negotiations back then suggesting that there might have been a political deal , that still would n't change the situation .
whether a deal was struck or not , karadzic has no claim to immunity , legal experts say .
" holbrooke or any other politician who negotiated in dayton or before and after dayton can not speak for the tribunal , " argued ambos .
" they are not organs of the tribunal and they can not give immunity to a person sought by the tribunal . "
he added : " even the correctly understood immunity rules which we accept in international law would not apply before an international criminal tribunal . "
no immunity his colleague concurred : " if you take international criminal justice seriously you ca n't grant immunity to anyone of that official and political standing , " said safferling .
he admitted that distinctions between political and legal solutions of conflicts often become blurred , but that in order to further establish the still nascent area of international criminal law it is imperative to draw a line .
" legally speaking you can not accept this .
there are allegations of criminal conduct and you have to prosecute this criminal conduct .
there is no question and immunities do n't play a role in this regard . "
both experts argued that the relevance of the karadzic trial can not be overestimated .
its significance is proven by the fact that the number of charges against karadzic was scaled down in negotiations between the prosecutors and the chamber in order to finish the trial in the foreseeable future , " because nobody wants to go through the same experience of a defendent who dies during the trial , " argued ambos , refering to milosevic who died during the proceedings .
he added that it is important for both the defendent and the people of bosnia-herzegovina that the alleged crimes carried out in the name of karadzic and the ideology of a greater serbia are investigated thoroughly during this trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief prosecutor serge brammertz has prepared the case against karadzic " this is very much a test case for international criminal justice and for the yugloslav tribunal as it is , " said safferling .
" so it is absolutely essential that there is a proper trial against karadzic . "
the challenge for the judges is enormous and goes far beyond the legal realm .
" if it is not guaranteed that it is a fair trial and the outcome is sort of acceptable to all the groups it might well be that the conflict erupts again in one way or the other , " argued safferling .
" everybody on the territory of the former yugoslavia will look at this trial and monitor what is going on in the hague very closely . "

the bosnian serb wartime leader is accused of genocide and war crimes . it was october 14 , 1991 .
yugoslavia had already fallen apart and fighting was rampant across croatia .
in the parliament of bosnia and herzegovina , the serb leader radovan karadzic stepped up to the lectern .
he then proceeded to issue a threat to muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats , who wanted to become independent from the serb-dominated remainder of the multi-ethnic state .
" consider that you could thereby lead bosnia and herzegovina to hell and perhaps lead the muslim people into annihilation , " karadzic told the parliament .
" if there is war here , the muslim people will not be able to defend themselves . "
shortly thereafter , in the spring of 1992 , the bloodiest conflict in europe since the end of world war two broke out in bosnia .
more than 110,000 people died , over a million were temporarily displaced .
for three-and-a-half years , the serbs shelled the beleaguered capital sarajevo with grenades .
snipers were also in action .
the sad climax came before the end of the war in 1995 : the execution of almost 8,000 bosniaks in srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : srebrenica was the scene of the largest mass murder in europe since world war two no mercy for karadzic in numerous concentration camps , women were massively raped and men beaten to death .
" i was heavily injured on my torso and stomach , " said murat tahirovic , who survived the abuse .
" the stomach wound was kept open and my torturers stuck a police baton in it .
i was beaten , several teeth were knocked out .
i was offended , mentally tortured , was n't allowed to use the toilet .
and you could n't wash yourself anyway . "
tahirovic was in his mid-20s at the time and a soldier in the bosniak army .
he was taken captive and put in a camp near the border to croatia .
after two months , the former mining engineer was freed .
today , he still suffers from constant pain and the pictures from then continue to haunt him .
in retrospect , tahirovic , who heads an association of former bosniak concentration camp detainees , said he does n't bear a grudge against his direct tormentors .
" they were too young at the time , manipulated by the media and put under pressure , " tahirovic said .
" in some respects , i forgive them . " but those who instructed the deeds , who were aware of the torture , they could not be forgiven , he said .
this was particularly the case for karadzic .
guilt confirmed the charges against karadzic at the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia total 11 points .
numerous previous judgments by the tribunal in the hague confirm that the crimes occurred .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karadzic pleaded not guilty at the un yugoslav war crimes tribunal mirsad tokaca , head of the war crimes research and documentation center in sarajevo , said the evidence against karadzic was overwhelming .
there could be no doubt of his guilt in the brutal human rights violations by the serbs in bosnia against muslim bosniaks and bosnian croats .
tokaca said karadzic triggered the war and knew he could count on slobodan milosevic , the nationalist and authoritarian president of serbia at the time .
" karadzic knew that belgrade and serbia were behind him , the milosevic regime and the yugoslav army , " tokaca said .
" the crimes which are considered key events were committed in april , may and in part june and july of 1992 .
at this time , the yugoslavian army was fighting for karadzic 's ideas with force of arms . "
tokaca has even delivered evidence of this : audio recordings from sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : the bosnian capital sarajevo suffered great destruction during the war karadzic was milosevic 's political protege and war ally .
the tribunal 's prosecutors are of the view that milosevic and karadzic and other serbian politicians and officers wanted to use the collapse of yugoslavia to forcibly take over those areas in croatia and bosnia inhabited by serbs .
from a hobby poet to a miracle healer milosevic died during his trial in the hague .
just as he did , karadzic is defending himself before the tribunal and expected to use the courtroom as a political stage .
the psychiatrist senadin ljubovic , who helps bosnian war victims , said karadzic is convinced that he acted correctly .
" he 'll even say he was forced to order the murder of those many people , " ljubovic said .
" he had warned them beforehand but they did n't want to listen to him .
i do n't think that he 'll ever show remorse . "
ljubovic was karadzic 's mentor .
he introduced the then young student to psychiatry at the clinic in sarajevo .
the hobby poet karadzic came to the bosnian capital with his parents from the montenegrin mountains .
later , he was prosecuted for embezzlement but never went to prison thanks to his unofficial collaboration with the intelligence service .
at the beginning of the war in bosnia , the nationalist was elected serbian president .
after the end of the war and arraignment , karadzic disappeared and was on the run for more than 13 years .
when he was caught last summer , he worked as a miracle healer in serbia 's capital belgrade .
since then , he 's been in custody in the hague .
karadzic is being held responsible for murder , torture and displacement during the balkan war 15 years ago .
he denies any guilt .
according to jurists , he can expect a lifelong sentence if convicted .

the biggest surprise of all was the nomination of philipp rösler as health minister , who despite his very german name has very asian looks - not that surprisingly , considering he was born in vietnam .
the first german minister of non-european origin has already achieved big things in the world of politics . philipp rösler 's prospects did not look so bright when he started out in life .
the 36-year-old was born during the vietnam war and spent the first months of his life in a catholic orphanage in saigon , now ho chi minh city .
at the age of nine months , he was adopted by a german couple .
his adoptive parents split up when he was four and he was brought up by his father , an officer in the german army .
perhaps his tumultuous childhood has given him the strength needed for a successful political career .
“ politicians have to have the courage to make decisions and i think i have it , ” he has told reporters .
“ they have to have the competence to make the right decisions .
they have to be in a position to motivate people and to implement what they have decided on successfully .
that ’ s how i imagine politics and i hope that comes across in my actions . ”
a brilliant career so far , rösler has shot up the ranks in germany ’ s fdp , the liberal and business-oriented free democratic party .
he joined the party ’ s youth wing at the age of 18 , becoming general secretary in the state of lower saxony at 27 .
in 2003 , he was elected to the regional parliament .
the father of two says he has never felt any resistance because of his background .
for him , the fact that he has been nominated as minister shows that germany is “ a liberal , open and tolerant country ” .
his vietnamese origins have never been an issue for rösler , who is a proud inhabitant of lower saxony .
in 2006 , he paid a visit to the country of his birth only because his wife wanted to know where he was from .
“ all asians are karate experts ” as a child he never had any trouble , he recently told a german weekly magazine jokingly , “ because people always think that all asians are karate experts ” anyway .
tens of thousands of vietnamese or people of vietnamese descent live in germany .
the head of the vietnamese student association in germany , hoa nguyen , is very happy that the vietnamese-born rösler has managed to bag this high political post .
however , she said , “ we don ’ t identify with him because , although he looks very vietnamese , he does not have the culture .
as far as i know he is married to a german woman so we think that his cultural background is very german and western .
we can ’ t identify with him but we are very happy for him , ” she said .
phuong le trong , a vietnamese linguist in bonn , said it was too early to tell : “ i think we may have to wait for some weeks until mr rösler is really established and then we can hear more questions and find out about his engagement referring to his origins . ”
what is clear is that germany hasn ’ t heard the last of this young asian-looking politician .

the biggest surprise of all was the nomination of philipp rösler as health minister , who despite his very german name has very asian looks - not that surprisingly , considering he was born in vietnam .
the first german minister of non-european origin has already achieved big things in the world of politics . philipp rösler 's prospects did not look so bright when he started out in life .
the 36-year-old was born during the vietnam war and spent the first months of his life in a catholic orphanage in saigon , now ho chi minh city .
at the age of nine months , he was adopted by a german couple .
his adoptive parents split up when he was four and he was brought up by his father , an officer in the german army .
perhaps his tumultuous childhood has given him the strength needed for a successful political career .
“ politicians have to have the courage to make decisions and i think i have it , ” he has told reporters .
“ they have to have the competence to make the right decisions .
they have to be in a position to motivate people and to implement what they have decided on successfully .
that ’ s how i imagine politics and i hope that comes across in my actions . ”
a brilliant career so far , rösler has shot up the ranks in germany ’ s fdp , the liberal and business-oriented free democratic party .
he joined the party ’ s youth wing at the age of 18 , becoming general secretary in the state of lower saxony at 27 .
in 2003 , he was elected to the regional parliament .
the father of two says he has never felt any resistance because of his background .
for him , the fact that he has been nominated as minister shows that germany is “ a liberal , open and tolerant country ” .
his vietnamese origins have never been an issue for rösler , who is a proud inhabitant of lower saxony .
in 2006 , he paid a visit to the country of his birth only because his wife wanted to know where he was from .
“ all asians are karate experts ” as a child he never had any trouble , he recently told a german weekly magazine jokingly , “ because people always think that all asians are karate experts ” anyway .
tens of thousands of vietnamese or people of vietnamese descent live in germany .
the head of the vietnamese student association in germany , hoa nguyen , is very happy that the vietnamese-born rösler has managed to bag this high political post .
however , she said , “ we don ’ t identify with him because , although he looks very vietnamese , he does not have the culture .
as far as i know he is married to a german woman so we think that his cultural background is very german and western .
we can ’ t identify with him but we are very happy for him , ” she said .
phuong le trong , a vietnamese linguist in bonn , said it was too early to tell : “ i think we may have to wait for some weeks until mr rösler is really established and then we can hear more questions and find out about his engagement referring to his origins . ”
what is clear is that germany hasn ’ t heard the last of this young asian-looking politician .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 26.10.2009 opinion : the new government must be judged on its promise of social justice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incoming cdu-fdp coalition government has simultaneously promised lower welfare contributions and social equality .
dw 's bettina marx fears that the latter is the most likely to suffer . " we want to lead the country out of the crisis to a new beginning in a new decade , " says the preamble to the coalition contract that the christian democrat union and the free democratic party agreed after three weeks of tough negotiations .
but how this is meant to work remains vague , and is apparently based mainly on hope - the hope that the economic cycle will turn , that the economy will recover quickly , that new jobs will emerge , and that the mountain of debt will be reduced .
but these are illusions rather than hopes .
one thing is already certain : if the new government implements its program , the state 's debts will increase further .
tax breaks worth 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- a year are set to be introduced on jan 1 , 2010 .
but angela merkel has categorically ruled out rises in taxes like the sales tax .
where is this money meant to come from ?
while presenting the coalition contract alongside horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union , and fdp chairman guido westerwelle , merkel confined herself to rather vague phrases .
" we want to walk the path of growth , " she said at the press conference in berlin , " we have to think dynamically . "
people should get more net income out of their gross income , and hard work should be rewarded again .
but whatever the government wants to put in one pocket , it will have to pull out of all the other pockets .
the financial relief and extra burdens involved can hardly be balanced .
the planned reform of the healthcare system shows in what direction this is heading : social security will be increasingly privatized , the principle of a mutually supportive insured community will be compromised .
the planned restructuring of the health insurance system , due to start in 2011 , requires that any future increase in contributions will be paid for by the employee , not the employer .
on top of this , people will be legally obliged to take on additional private long-term care insurance .
this will please insurance companies - they will get millions of new contracts .
but a shudder might go through those who pay insurance premiums when they think of the millions of pensioners in the us who were plunged into poverty by the financial crisis and the recklessness of insurance companies after having paid into funded pension insurance systems .
so does this represent a permanent switch from the german contribution system based on fiscal parity to an american-style capital funded system ?
will the re-structuring of society , begun under former chancellor gerhard schroeder 's center-left government and continued under merkel 's grand coalition , finally be cemented ?
will the redistribution from the bottom up , a process that has incontrovertibly happened in the past few years , be continued ?
the coalition partners who cheerfully sat before the press on saturday morning carefully avoided any impression that their government would be one of social neglect .
they believe in social justice , they said , and they want to remove all remaining social inequalities .
these are the promises with which the cdu-fdp coalition has entered government .
now they must be measured on how they honor these promises .
we can only hope for an effective opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 26.10.2009 german state premier to become new eu commissioner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther oettinger 's conservative colleagues expect his " strong personality " to send a message to brussels guenther oettinger has been the premier of the southwestern german state of baden-wuerttemburg since 2005 , but now he 's been tipped for a new role : eu commissioner . guenther oettinger , 56 , accepted the post on saturday .
trained as a lawyer , he is regarded as an economic expert .
" we need a strong personality in brussels that has the economic policy experience , and knows what 's important in our country , " said volker kauder , head of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group .
" that is a strong signal from this national government to brussels . "
the move , announced after coalition talks between chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats and the free democrats , drew criticism from oettinger 's opponents in the baden-wuerttemburg government .
the social democrats said merkel was simply " withdrawing a beleaguered premier from circulation . "
green party politician juergen trittin said oettinger had proven himself to be a less than enthusiastic supporter of european integration .
far left party die linke has called for new state elections .
the christian democrats in baden-wuerttemburg suffered significant losses in state polls earlier this year , despite being the dominant party since 1953 .
they won only 34.4 percent of the party vote , a 5 percent drop compared to the 2005 election results .
oettinger is known for his ability to rattle off facts when challenged in his thick swabian accent , which often stymies german listeners .
he was also at the center of a 2007 controversy in which he eulogized his predecessor hans filbinger as " an opponent of nazism , " when filbinger was in fact part of a nazi judicial team that sentenced army deserters to death .
oettinger later distanced himself from his remarks .
a return to brussels for christian democrats it has been more than two decades since a christian democrat served as germany 's commissioner .
the last was karl-heinz narjes , who served from 1981-1988 .
oettinger would replace social democrat guenther verheugen , who has served as commissioner since 1999 and as the body 's vice president since 2004 .
his current term officially ends on october 31 .
there is one eu commissioner for each member country .
commissioners serve five-year terms , and new ones are chosen within six months of european parliamentary elections .
the list of candidates must be approved by at least two-thirds of the council of ministers and by a simple majority of the eu parliament .
the brussels-based commission 's main duties include proposing and reviewing legislation , simplifying eu procedure , enforcing european law and serving as the eu 's representatives internationally .
if oettinger is confirmed , his likely successor in baden-wuerttemburg is stefan mappus , the cdu 's party head there. svs / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the first case , alex w. was appealing a fine he had been ordered to pay after being convicted of verbally abusing al-shirbini in 2008 .
he had called her a " terrorist , " an " islamist " and a " whore . "
the case has ignited muslim sentiments around the world , with arab media dubbing al-shirbini " the veil martyr . "
alex w. is also facing charges of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm .
" he wanted to annihilate them " al-shirbini 's widower , elwi ali okaz , who was seriously wounded in the courtroom attack on his wife , was called to the stand on monday to give evidence against alex w. okaz said the defendant had plunged an 18-centimeter -lrb- seven-inch -rrb- kitchen knife repeatedly into his veiled wife , who was three months pregnant at the time with their second child .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : okaz spoke of alex w. stabbing his wife repeatedly describing the events , okaz said neither he nor his wife had any sense they were in danger , but said : " the perpetrator suddenly attacked my wife - he hit her several times and when i tried to help he hit me too .
it was only then that i noticed he had a knife and that he had stabbed her … then he began stabbing me too . "
prosecutor frank heinrich told the court alex w. had knowingly used the july court appearance as an opportunity to take the lives of al-shirbini and her husband .
" he stabbed them out of pure hatred against non-europeans and muslims .
he wanted to annihilate them , " heinrich told the court , where many people were wearing badges brandished with al-shirbini 's face .
a member of alex w. 's legal team said the 29-year-old accused would not speak at the trial .
his lawyers also demanded that the trial be postponed because of the perceived bias of the judges - a request that was turned down on monday afternoon as the court began hearing evidence .
the defendant , wearing sunglasse and a hood , then sat with his back to the rest of the courtroom .
courtroom security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arab media have covered the murder case very closely around 200 police , some on horseback , were stationed outside the courtroom after internet death threats were made against the defendant , who was seated behind bullet-proof glass .
police had said there was " an abstract danger , " but had no concrete evidence an attack was planned on the defendant .
the killing of al-shirbini has caused waves in some arab countries , particularly in her hometown of alexandria , egypt .
the attack , and a slow reaction by the german media and government , sparked accusations of neglectful handling of hate crimes against muslims .
the case triggered anti-german protests in egypt and iran and sparked fears of an escalation similar to the violent riots caused by the publication in europe of caricatures of prophet mohammed in 2005 .
the egyptian ambassador to germany , ramzy ezzeldin ramzy , said he expected " a speedy sentence , a just sentence that is commensurate with this heinous crime , " adding that he had " every confidence in the justice system in germany .

anyone suffering a chronic illness can also have the immunization .
germany 's 16 states are responsible for administering the immunizations in their own jurisdiction , however , that has resulted in different rules for each state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 26.10.2009 exploitation of unstable regions fuelling europe 's drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's instability feeds europe 's heroin habit the escalating instability in afghanistan , corruption and war in africa , organized crime in central asia and eastern europe , and cartel wars in latin america are all contributing to the flow of illegal drugs into europe . new figures on the state of the drugs problem in europe will be released by the european monitoring center for drugs and drug addiction -lrb- emcdda -rrb- in the first week of november .
the figures , which in recent years have seen stabilization in addiction figures and even reversal of some drug trends , are likely to be impacted by increasingly fluid security situations around the world . the continuing instability in afghanistan remains a huge concern on many levels , including the effect it is having on europe 's illegal drug trade .
the seemingly unstoppable flow of heroin and opium out of the country feeds the habits of an estimated 15 million addicts worldwide , with europe , russia and iran consuming half of afghanistan 's supply .
with afghanistan producing 92 percent of the world 's opium and trafficking the equivalent of 3,500 tons of opium per year in the form of heroin , the war-torn central asian country is europe 's biggest pusher . as the security situation worsens and the focus of western strategists remains largely on a military defeat of the taliban rather than a coordinated attempt to both destroy the insurgents ' main cash crop while providing poor famers with an alternative source of income , experts believe europe 's dependency on afghanistan is unlikely to wane any time soon .
the situation in countries surrounding afghanistan is also likely to keep the flood gates open . afghanistan the motor behind golden crescent 's supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 98 percent of afghan opium gets out of the country according to the latest un office on drugs and crime report , less than two percent of the opium and heroin afghanistan produces is seized by authorities before it leaves the country . most of the supply - around 40 percent - is distributed through neighboring pakistan , a country with its own mounting security problems .
iran and central asia provide alternative routes , with restive and corrupt former soviet states providing passage into eastern europe where the heroin is then distributed throughout european union countries . " afghanistan is obviously a problem due to its production rate but the transit routes its neighbors offer are probably more important , " fabrice pothier , the director of the brussels office of the carnegie endowment for international peace , told deutsche welle . " pakistan has become the main platform for spreading opium to south east asia while tajikistan has opened up a route into the former soviet states , russia and eastern europe .
this is not only bring heroin through these countries but also developing markets and the subsequent health problems associated with use and addiction as it goes , " he said . organized crime networks aiding flow into europe turkey also plays a central role in the heroin trade destined for europe .
being geographically and historically linked to the so-called golden crescent area of opium production - which is afghanistan , iran and pakistan - turkey 's position on the cross-roads of europe , asia and the middle east , and its many land and sea connections to the neighboring region , makes it an important player in both the transport and refining of afghan opium .
statistics suggest that around 80 percent of unrefined opium from afghanistan is made into heroin in turkey . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some heroin reaches eu states through the balkan route europe has also seen an increase in heroin trafficking over the last few years via the balkans .
providing the main overland connection between asia and europe , the balkan route provides passage to an estimated 75 percent of the heroin smuggled into europe .
the region 's recent history of civil war and upheaval , and the emergence of a widespread organized crime network , makes the balkans a hot-bed for all manner of trafficking operations . " organized crime in the balkans has been on the rise for the last 20 years ever since the break up of the former yugoslavia , " pothier said .
" organized crime and corruption is embedded in the structure of most of the balkan countries and therefore the balkans have become a major market and transit point between east and west for everything from afghan heroin to small arms and slave labor . " the flow of cocaine - the favorite narcotic among europe 's 15-34 year olds - is also being aided by instability in transit regions which smoothes its progress to european users .
un figures show that in the last two years , around 40 tons of cocaine has been entering europe annually through western africa . west african hubs favored by latin american cartels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine passes through west africa on its way to europe west african countries such as guinea-bissau have become the preferred hubs for latin america 's cartels trafficking cocaine to europe in recent years as destabilized and corrupt governments provide traffickers with the infrastructural chaos which eases passage . consequently , the booming west african cocaine trade actually creates more corruption and threatens security across the region .
un officials say that countries which have weakened governmental infrastructures and are more susceptible to corruption have an increased potential to become a ' narco state ' and a nation dependent on drug money to survive . " the west african hubs are relatively new and have been developing over the past decade due to the number of local conflicts in the region and the knock-on effects of the us crackdown on cocaine , " pothier said .
" south american cartels are very flexible and have taken advantage of african hubs to target europe as an alternative market to the us .
the bulk now goes to spain and italy , europe 's main entry points for cocaine , and huge increases of cocaine uses have been recorded in both countries over the past 10 years . " cocaine still heading for us despite mexican crackdown with africa an already established route and europe a willing alternative to cocaine previously tagged for the united states , some experts are concerned that the current drug war in mexico may lead to the west african route becoming more popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crackdown in mexico could force more drugs into the eu a traditional route for cocaine trafficking into the united states from south america , mexico has seen a huge escalation in drug-related violence as cartels battle each other for control of transit routes which supply the $ 40 billion-a-year cocaine business across the border in the us . some observers believe that the producers of cocaine in latin america will eventually start to notice the adverse effects the violence is having on its supply routes in mexico and , coupled with the steady decline of cocaine use in the united states , will look to another market . pothier , however , believes that while this can not be ruled out over time , the current violence in mexico has yet to have an effect on the flow of cocaine to the united states and is therefore not hindering the flow of the latin american supply . " this violence we are seeing is coming mostly from a reorganization of supply lines and a conflict between central government and regional powers who have had an understanding with the cartels in thier areas , " he said .
" we will have to wait and see whether violence will actually have an effect on the supply , but we have n't seen any signs of less cocaine reaching the us .

twelve of the most internationally renowned light artists display their work there . thirty years ago , the last shipment of beer left the linden brewery in unna , a blue-collar town in northwestern germany .
now the brewery 's series of cold rooms and cellars - left entirely unrestored - are home to the center for international light art . " the idea was to bring light art here because it 's one of the most innovative kinds of art there is , " curator ursula sinnreich told deutsche welle . the dark basement not only provides a mysterious and glamorous backdrop for the artwork , the labyrinthine structure allows each piece a room of its own . acclaimed light artists like james turrell and joseph kosuth were attracted by the ideal environment in the former brewery and in 2001 the world 's first museum dedicated exclusively to light art opened in unna . broken words and suspended water each room appeals to the senses in a different way , whether through blaring neon lights , shadows , or water . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuball 's " space speach speed " comments on modern communication in one room , dusseldorf-based artists mischa kuball projects words onto mirrored balls in an installation entitled " space speech speed .

" mobile phones and the internet have set the world in motion ; everyone is reachable at any time .
boundaries are broken - and that 's what 's reflected in this room . " visitors inevitably walk through the line of projection in kuball 's work , becoming part of the installation themselves . in another room , danish artist olafur eliasson has set up a disco-like strobe light .
visitors are invited to walk across a narrow platform flanked on both sides by drops of water .
the rhythm of the strobe light is synchronized with the falling water drops , which seem to come to standstill . bildunterschrift : " tunnel of tears for unna " by keith sonnier anyone can experience art while light art insiders make the pilgrimage to unna , the majority of the museum 's visitors are local - and that 's the organizers ' aim .

local authorities reported that maksharip aushev was driving near the town of nalchik in the nearby region of kabardion-balkaria when his car was sprayed with automatic-weapon fire .
the attack also seriously wounded a passenger .
according to the opposition website , the attack took place on a main road , but the full circumstances remained unclear .
aushev was a strong critic of the region 's former president , murat zyayikov , and had led protests to publicize human rights abuses allegedly committed by government security forces .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natalya estemirova , a human rights activist , was murdered a few months ago colleagues of the slain activist are shocked and many have spoken out , including yunus-bek yevkorov , the kremlin appointee who took over the position of regional president a year ago .
in a statement on his website , yevkorov said the killing was an attempt to destabilize the situation in ingushetia and that he would personally take charge of the investigation .
alexander cherkasov , from the human rights group memorial , told echo of moscow radio that aushev had received threats and that in recent weeks he feared the secret services would take revenge .
attacks on the rise this is just the latest in an increasing number of attacks over the past few months in the north caucasus .
in july , natalya estemirova , a prominent human rights activist , was found shot dead in ingushetia .
a month later , zarema sadulayeva , a chechen woman who helped injured children , and her husband were kidnapped and killed .
the russian government has blamed the attacks on muslim insurgents , who it says are backed by foreign cash which threatens moscow 's control over the volatile southern region .
the worst hit areas have been dagestan , ingushetia and chechnya .
russia has fought two wars against chechen separatists since 1994 .
bildunterschrift : moscow has been having trouble maintaining control over the north caucasus since 1994 aushev had close ties with another prominent local opposition activist , magomed yevloyev , who was detained and killed by local police in august 2008 .
the website ingushetia.org , which aushev owned at one time , said the deaths of the two men were linked and that anyone who dared to speak against the authorities or speak the truth , is doomed to the fate shared by magomed and maksharip .
tatiana lochkina , director of human rights watch in moscow , agreed .
she told interfax that the killing " illustrates very clearly the atmosphere of impunity " in the region .
she added that participating in opposition politics or defending basic freedoms in the north caucasus has become " almost a form of suicide .

leverkusen 's kiessling is becoming impossible for loew to ignore -pipe- sports -pipe- deutsche welle -pipe- 26.10.2009 main content main navigation extra content head navigation search choose form 30 languages dw-world.de deutsche welle about us press business & sales dw-akademie dw-store contact help partner site map archive search keywords search dw-world : extended search your link to germany choose from 30 languages choose from 30 languages choose from 30 languages english german chinese spanish portuguese for brazil arabic russian persian albanian amharic bengali bosnian b / h / s bulgarian croatian dari french greek hausa hindi indonesian kiswahili macedonian pashto polish portuguese romanian serbian turkish ukrainian urdu choose from 30 languages 05.12.2009 home news world germany europe business science & technology environment & development culture & lifestyle sports germany info visit germany study in germany map weather german courses learning german deutsch unterrichten german xxl dw-radio what 's on ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.10.2009 leverkusen 's kiessling is becoming impossible for loew to ignore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the signs for kiessling are pointing up with klose , gomez and podolski out of sorts , the door is open for other german forwards .
but does stefan kiessling have what it takes for the world cup ?
deutsche welle spoke with him about his prospects . two years ago kiessling , who 's now 25 years old , was touted as one of germany 's most promising young players .
he had just transferred from nuremberg to much higher profile bayer leverkusen , and in march 2007 he earned his first cap for germany in a friendly against denmark .
but only one further call has come from germany coach joachim loew since then .
while kiessling 's productivity has steadily improved , he failed to post the stellar numbers or create the sort of spectacular goals that elevated mario gomez and more recently mesut oezil into the nationalelf .
as germany 's qualifying campaign entered its decisive phase this autumn , kiessling had become an afterthought .
at least for loew .
with six goals in 10 league matches , kiessling is currently the most successful forward with a german passport .
indeed , kiessling shares the top spot in the bundesliga 's goal scoring list with bremen 's claudio pizarro .
and that has n't gone without notice .
in a poll carried out by the german web site www.soccer-fans.de , more than 71 percent of respondents said they thought kiessling deserved a spot in the national side .
and in an editorial , the on-line soccer magazine fussball forum criticized loew for breaking his meritocratic principles .
“ if performance is the main criteria for inclusion , someone like stefan kiessling would definitely have to have been part of the squad , ” the magazine opined .
what has kiessling done to earn loew 's neglect ?
nothing really , as it turns out .
the overrated label bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling scored in each of his first five games this season kiessling was regarded as one of the top prizes on the transfer market in the summer of 2006 .
and the hopes thereby engendered may have been part of the problem .
“ when i first came to leverkusen , they 'd paid 5.5 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- , and that was a sum that made me swallow hard back then , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ i did n't have that much experience and had n't played that many first-division matches for nuremberg so 5.5 million was a burden to bear . ”
looking at the numbers , it 's hard to argue that the striker has n't lived up to expectations .
kiessling has improved his goal and assist tallies in each of his three seasons with leverkusen .
his 12 goals and seven assists in 2008-09 put him among the best forwards in germany , but the key word here is perhaps among .
while gomez was leading stuttgart to a league title and challenging for the goal-scorer 's crown , kiessling often played second fiddle to his leverkusen striking partner patrick helmes on a team that always seemed to fade as the season wore on .
a klinsmann type of player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at times kiessling 's game is reminiscent of klinsmann 's another thing that has held kiessling back is that he does n't look the part of a german national .
klose , gomez and even podolski have a certain gravitas that fits well with the nationalelf , whereas the blond striker often gives the impression of being a 1meter-90 -lrb- 6-foot-two -rrb- kid who 's just happy to be able to kick the ball around .
moreover , no one who 's ever seen him play live would mistake kiessling for a brilliant technician .
he 's a striker who scores by being in the right place at the right time , mopping up rebounds or getting a head on crosses .
as such , he 's a player whose form usually follows that of his team .
when leverkusen have done well , so has kiessling , but when things have gone wrong , he has n't been the one who can turn things round with an individual bit of brilliance .
leverkusen currently top the table , and kiessling is off to his best-ever season start in 2009-10 .
the striker gives much of the credit to leverkusen 's new coach .
“ in general , i like to practice because it 's fun playing soccer , but under jupp heynckes , who was a striker himself , you can learn a lot - and that 's unbelievably fun , ” kiessling said .
you do n't have to go back too far in german soccer history to find a somewhat gangly forward who had success for the national team - loew 's predecessor , juergen klinsmann .
klinsi , too , as a player was mocked for being inelegant and happy-go-lucky , and he went on to score 47 goals for germany in more than a decade in the national side .
a team effort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiessling could well take cacau 's spot in the germany squad as goes leverkusen , so goes kiessling .
ironically , that means the striker 's chances in the nationalelf may be dependent on his club 's back four , the part of the squad that wilted most in leverkusen 's plunge from the top to the middle of the table last season .
kiessling says that , thanks to new acquisitions like veterans sami hyypia , this year will be a different story .
“ with sami back there , we have the sort of person we needed last year to hold the defense together , ” kiessling said .
“ at the moment , everything 's clicking .
we 've got a coach who directs us , and we – so to speak – play the music on the pitch . ”
and he 's astonishingly cool when it comes to the lack of calls he 's had from germany coach loew .
“ the last contact was in february , ” kiessling told deutsche welle .
“ since then , i 've heard nothing .
but that 's no big deal .
why should he call me up to say : ‘ you 're in good form , but despite that i 'm not taking you with us ? ”
klose , poldi and gomez have the inside track , when it comes to the national squad .
but injuries could keep one or more of them from travelling to south africa , and germany 's fourth striker in recent matches , cacau , is by no means guaranteed to be in the 2010 squad .
so , in his heart of hearts , kiessling must being hoping that loew rings up soon to say he is in good form and will be taken along for football 's most prestigious tournament .

radovan karadzic stands accused of leading a huge criminal enterprise , involving genocide , extermination and the forced expulsion of non-serbs from their homes .
the document runs to more than 60 pages and cites hundreds of individual crimes .
in sarajevo , for example , in november 1994 , a young mother called dzenana sokolovic was struck in the abdomen by a sniper 's bullet while she was out collecting wood .
the bullet passed straight through her and struck her seven-year-old son nermin in the head , killing him instantly .
mrs sokolovic survived and is ready to come to the hague to testify against radovan karadzic .
" i would , " she told me last week , " go to the moon to get justice for my son . "
ethnic cleansing this lingering sense of justice not yet done is the unfinished business of bosnia 's three-and-a-half-year war .
among the charges mr karadzic faces is responsibility for the siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serb forces surrounded the city on all sides and throughout the war subjected it to shelling and sniping .
the intention , the prosecution claims , was to terrorise the civilian population .
the worst single atrocity of the war occurred at srebrenica in eastern bosnia .
when it fell to bosnian serb forces more than 7,000 muslim men and boys were rounded up and murdered in the space of a few days .
the prosecution say radovan karadzic carries his share of responsibility for this too .
mr karadzic was the leader of the bosnian serbs .
in 1992 , when bosnia declared independence from the disintegrating federal republic of yugoslavia , mr karadzic formed a separate state , later to be called republika srpska .
the aim was to create an independent homeland for the serbs of bosnia .
hundreds of thousands of non-serbs were driven from their homes in a campaign that came to be known as " ethnic cleansing " .
radovan karadzic denies all the charges .
few dispute that the crimes outlined in the indictment took place .
many others have already been convicted of them and are serving prison sentences .
but the prosecution will have to establish a direct line of culpability between the men who wielded the weapons and pulled the triggers , and radovan karadzic in person , sitting at his desk at his mountain headquarters in pale .
the court has given the prosecution hundreds of hours of witness time to try to do just that .
mr karadzic has the right to cross examine the prosecution witnesses and to call witnesses of his own .
he intends to represent himself .
he has decided to co-operate with the court to prove his innocence .
the trial could last many months , even years .

in sarajevo , for example , in november 1994 , a young mother called dzenana sokolovic was struck in the abdomen by a sniper 's bullet while she was out collecting wood .
the bullet passed straight through her and struck her seven-year-old son nermin in the head , killing him instantly .

radovan karadzic denies all the charges .
few dispute that the crimes outlined in the indictment took place .
many others have already been convicted of them and are serving prison sentences .
but the prosecution will have to establish a direct line of culpability between the men who wielded the weapons and pulled the triggers , and radovan karadzic in person , sitting at his desk at his mountain headquarters in pale .

in his weekly tv programme , mr chavez said that gabriel silva must be " mentally retarded " .
last week , mr silva released a statement accusing venezuela of failing to tackle international drug routes .
he said there was " almost a free traffic " of flights loaded with drugs from venezuelan territory .
the bad feeling between the venezuelan and the colombian governments has been kept under control by a mutual silence for several weeks now , but it only takes a small event for it to erupt into insults again .
in this instance , the colombian defence minister 's comments were more than enough .
on his alo presidente programme , mr chavez gave a typically damning response .
" the colombian defence minister ?
i think he 's mentally retarded , " he said .
he added that the only explanation for his behaviour was that he was " following instructions from the empire " , referring to the us .
the president 's comments come shortly after an official protest note was sent to colombia by the venezuelan foreign ministry .
but many commentators in venezuela and colombia say that such measured diplomacy is what is missing from this confrontation .
mr silva is due to head to meet us defence secretary robert gates in washington shortly .
this latest outburst by washington 's most vocal critic in latin america comes at a sensitive time over the us military 's use of seven military bases on colombian soil - something they say will help in the fight against drug trafficking , but which mr chavez says will destabilise the security of the region .

in his weekly tv programme , mr chavez said that gabriel silva must be " mentally retarded " .
last week , mr silva released a statement accusing venezuela of failing to tackle international drug routes .
he said there was " almost a free traffic " of flights loaded with drugs from venezuelan territory .
the bad feeling between the venezuelan and the colombian governments has been kept under control by a mutual silence for several weeks now , but it only takes a small event for it to erupt into insults again .
in this instance , the colombian defence minister 's comments were more than enough .
on his alo presidente programme , mr chavez gave a typically damning response .
" the colombian defence minister ?
i think he 's mentally retarded , " he said .
he added that the only explanation for his behaviour was that he was " following instructions from the empire " , referring to the us .
the president 's comments come shortly after an official protest note was sent to colombia by the venezuelan foreign ministry .
but many commentators in venezuela and colombia say that such measured diplomacy is what is missing from this confrontation .
mr silva is due to head to meet us defence secretary robert gates in washington shortly .
this latest outburst by washington 's most vocal critic in latin america comes at a sensitive time over the us military 's use of seven military bases on colombian soil - something they say will help in the fight against drug trafficking , but which mr chavez says will destabilise the security of the region .

recep tayyip erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper western fears iran wanted to build the bomb were " gossip " .
his comments come as a team from the un nuclear watchdog continues its inspection of a previously secret uranium plant near the city of qom .
mr erdogan is due in tehran for talks with both president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the country 's supreme leader .
the turkish leader suggested that there was a dual standard in the west 's approach towards iran .
he said any military strike against iran would be " crazy " .
mr erdogan also said many of the states which objected to any move by iran to build a nuclear arsenal - including all the permanent members of the un security council - possessed one themselves .
" there is a style of approach which is not very fair because those -lsb- who accuse iran of pursuing nuclear weapons -rsb- have very strong nuclear infrastructures , " mr erdogan said .
" so although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " he added .
his comments come as world powers await iran 's response to a new proposed deal over its uranium enrichment programme .
under the arrangement , iran would send some enriched uranium to russia to be turned into fuel .
the proposed deal is seen as a way for tehran to get the fuel it needs for an existing reactor , while giving guarantees to the west that its enriched uranium will not be used for nuclear weapons .
mountainside plant but opposition inside iran to the agreement is said to be growing .
the government has promised a response this week .
the four-member iaea team is expected to return for a second day on monday to the country 's fordo enrichment facility , some 30km -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- north of the holy city of qom .
nuclear fuel cycle mined uranium ore is purified and reconstituted into solid form known as yellowcake yellowcake is converted into a gas by heating it to about 64c -lrb- 147f -rrb- gas is fed through centrifuges , where its isotopes separate and process is repeated until uranium is enriched low-level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel highly enriched uranium can be used in nuclear weapons in depth : nuclear fuel cycle send your comments during their mission , the inspectors are expected to compare the engineering blueprints submitted by iran with the actual layout of the plant , interview employees , and take environmental samples to check for the presence of nuclear materials .
the iranian government says the fordo plant - which is cut into a mountainside , constructed of reinforced concrete and protected by military installations including missile silos and anti-aircraft batteries - will not be operational for another 18 months .
they claim it will be large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges , which will produce uranium that is 5 % enriched , suitable only for peaceful purposes .
weapons-grade material is more than 90 % enriched .
iran agreed to open the site to monitoring at talks with the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in geneva on 1 october .
iran says its nuclear programme is for purely peaceful purposes but the revelation of the existence of the new plant had increased fears in the west about tehran 's intentions .

recep tayyip erdogan told britain 's guardian newspaper western fears iran wanted to build the bomb were " gossip " .
his comments come as a team from the un nuclear watchdog continues its inspection of a previously secret uranium plant near the city of qom .
mr erdogan is due in tehran for talks with both president mahmoud ahmadinejad and the country 's supreme leader .
the turkish leader suggested that there was a dual standard in the west 's approach towards iran .
he said any military strike against iran would be " crazy " .
mr erdogan also said many of the states which objected to any move by iran to build a nuclear arsenal - including all the permanent members of the un security council - possessed one themselves .
" there is a style of approach which is not very fair because those -lsb- who accuse iran of pursuing nuclear weapons -rsb- have very strong nuclear infrastructures , " mr erdogan said .
" so although iran does n't have a weapon , those who say iran should n't have them are those countries which do , " he added .
his comments come as world powers await iran 's response to a new proposed deal over its uranium enrichment programme .
under the arrangement , iran would send some enriched uranium to russia to be turned into fuel .
the proposed deal is seen as a way for tehran to get the fuel it needs for an existing reactor , while giving guarantees to the west that its enriched uranium will not be used for nuclear weapons .

the iranian government says the fordo plant - which is cut into a mountainside , constructed of reinforced concrete and protected by military installations including missile silos and anti-aircraft batteries - will not be operational for another 18 months .
they claim it will be large enough to house 3,000 centrifuges , which will produce uranium that is 5 % enriched , suitable only for peaceful purposes .

under the new rules , lone parents in this category will be switched from income support to the tougher jobseeker 's allowance .
while this pays the same amount of benefit , parents must show they have applied for jobs in order to claim it .
last year , single parents with older children faced the same switch .
work and pensions secretary yvette cooper said she would make it easier to find work that fits school times .
she said she would do this through new regulations , and changes to how jobcentres operate .
' personalised help ' the move affects 68,000 lone parents .
already 80 % of all lone parents are either working or would like to work work and pensions secretary , yvette cooper single parents of children aged between seven and 10 will be moved to jobseeker 's allowance in october next year .
the department for work and pensions said the continuing changes are being matched by more " personalised help and support " from jobcentres , whose staff are being given greater flexibility to respond to a person 's individual circumstances .
" already 80 % of all lone parents are either working or would like to work , " said ms cooper .
" and we know it 's much better for families if parents can work .
that 's why we are changing the rules for parents with older children in school to help them find work . "
she added that the government realised that many parents also wanted to work part-time , so they can pick their children up from school .
" we 're making it easier for parents to look for jobs that fit with school hours - both through regulations and developing changes to jobcentres . "
the welfare change comes after ms cooper said in an interview with a sunday paper that she wanted employers to offer more part-time jobs for working parents .

" and we know it 's much better for families if parents can work .
that 's why we are changing the rules for parents with older children in school to help them find work . "
she added that the government realised that many parents also wanted to work part-time , so they can pick their children up from school .
" we 're making it easier for parents to look for jobs that fit with school hours - both through regulations and developing changes to jobcentres . "
the welfare change comes after ms cooper said in an interview with a sunday paper that she wanted employers to offer more part-time jobs for working parents .
