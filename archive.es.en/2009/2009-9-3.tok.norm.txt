program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.09.2009 osnabrueck picks up the pieces after british withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop withdrawal has changed the town 's atmosphere the northern german city of osnabrueck was once the largest british military base outside the uk .
the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.09.2009 german town puts student in the mayor 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel zimmermann will swap cologne university for monheim 's town hall residents of the german town of monheim recently elected a 27-year-old phd student as their next mayor .
daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .

at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .

leading medical sources say hospitals frequently pay doctors premiums for sending patients their way . the allegations , which both the association of german hospitals -lrb- dkg -rrb- and the central organization of medical self-administration -lrb- baek -rrb- say hold some truth , have sent waves of outrage rippling through germany .
health minister ulla schmidt has called for a quick investigation into the claims .
in an interview with the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper , she said the practice of hospitals paying doctors for particularly lucrative admissions was harmful to patients .
schmidt stressed that it was now up to medical associations to find out just how deep-seated such corruption is .
deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder told public broadcaster ard that where there was " real evidence , " charges would be brought .
but he said he did not see any need to change the laws currently in place to protect against corruption in the medical industry .
gray areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals like to have their beds filled dina michels of kkh health insurers said there was an urgent need to tighten legislation .
she told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that she had never come across a case of a doctor being prosecuted on corruption charges .
michels says doctors are not only engaged in dubious dealings with hospitals , but with health product retailers as well .
she said that in exchange for contracts , some doctors might have their assistants paid for while others might receive a leased car for their wives .
the association of german hospitals , however , says politicians are at least partially to blame for the current situation .
the dkg 's managing director , georg baum , told n24 television news channel that politicians should stop commercializing the relationship between doctors and treatment .
he said schemes by which doctors were rewarded for making medication savings or for not admitting patients to hospital , were teaching them to think in " economic terms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 03.09.2009 german intelligence paid raf terrorist for information großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker received money for information the german interior ministry is coming under increasing pressure to release the files of former far-left red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- terrorist verena becker , following revelations that she was paid as an informer . becker , who was arrested at her home last week in connection with the 1977 murder of the federal prosecutor general siegfried buback , featured in a documentary about the killing screened on public broadcast television on wednesday night .
the film showed interview footage with a former intelligence agent who said becker had given germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , tip-offs leading to the subsequent arrest of two leading raf figures , brigitte mohnhaupt and christian klar .
the man also said becker had provided information about further assassinations planned by the group , sometimes referred to as the baader-meinhof gang .
in return , she received money , which german media reports say amounted to some 100,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 50,000 euros , $ 70,000 -rrb- .
it is not uncommon for the bfv to pay informants to provide information .
wednesday 's disclosure has led to calls from across the political spectrum for interior minister wolfgang schaeuble to release bfv files on becker .
right to view ?
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group said a refusal to release the files led to suspicion that the state had something to hide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the 1977 shooting which left buback and two others dead " i wonder what state interest could be more important than getting to the bottom of a triple murder , " bosbach told the neue osnabruecker zeitung .
in 2007 , the interior ministry rejected an application to release the files , but the prosecutor general 's office has now reapplied and the ministry is apparently thinking it over .
but ministry spokesman stefan paris said the nature of the content meant it was unlikely it could be used in any legal proceedings .
" when the bfv works with informers who come forward to provide information on particular cases , such as ms becker did , it is always under a covenant of secrecy . "
bosbach has also called for clarity over the money becker was allegedly paid for her insider knowledge .
he said he could not understand how the state could fail to punish a lawbreaker and then pay her .
new evidence could lead to closure the 57-year-old ex-baader-meinhof member was first arrested in 1977 after a shoot-out in which she seriously injured a policeman .
she was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder .
investigators looked into becker 's involvement in the buback slaying , but with a lack of evidence linking her to the case , they dropped it in 1980 .
three other raf members were sentenced to long spells in jail for buback 's killing , but police have never established who fired the shots , as the terrorists refused to talk .
becker , meanwhile , was released 12 years into her sentence and had been living in berlin under an assumed name until police turned up new evidence implicating her in the triple murder .
she was arrested again last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have found fresh evidence linking becker to buback 's murder the authorities say they still do n't believe she fired the shots that killed buback and two others , but they say becker 's dna , which was found on the envelopes of letters claiming responsibility for the crime , link her to it .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor general , however , believes becker is the assassin the police have been looking for more than three decades .
in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper , he said he saw unbelievable mistakes and inadequacies in the futile efforts to find out who killed his father .

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .
reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da mbabi has done well to keep a spot in the national team at such a young age the 21-year-old bajramaj says she tries to use her high public profile to help others . she says she regularly receives letters from german girls with immigrant backgrounds who are looking for help or advice .
" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

leading medical sources say hospitals frequently pay doctors premiums for sending patients their way . the allegations , which both the association of german hospitals -lrb- dkg -rrb- and the central organization of medical self-administration -lrb- baek -rrb- say hold some truth , have sent waves of outrage rippling through germany .
health minister ulla schmidt has called for a quick investigation into the claims .
in an interview with the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper , she said the practice of hospitals paying doctors for particularly lucrative admissions was harmful to patients .
schmidt stressed that it was now up to medical associations to find out just how deep-seated such corruption is .
deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder told public broadcaster ard that where there was " real evidence , " charges would be brought .
but he said he did not see any need to change the laws currently in place to protect against corruption in the medical industry .
gray areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals like to have their beds filled dina michels of kkh health insurers said there was an urgent need to tighten legislation .
she told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that she had never come across a case of a doctor being prosecuted on corruption charges .
michels says doctors are not only engaged in dubious dealings with hospitals , but with health product retailers as well .
she said that in exchange for contracts , some doctors might have their assistants paid for while others might receive a leased car for their wives .
the association of german hospitals , however , says politicians are at least partially to blame for the current situation .
the dkg 's managing director , georg baum , told n24 television news channel that politicians should stop commercializing the relationship between doctors and treatment .
he said schemes by which doctors were rewarded for making medication savings or for not admitting patients to hospital , were teaching them to think in " economic terms .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .

at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .

" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

he also said inflation would become positive and that interest rates would remain at an historic low of one percent . speaking at the headquarters of the ecb in frankfurt , trichet said the period of contraction for the 16 eurozone economies had come to an end .
the overall eurozone economy shrank only 0.1 percent in the second quarter , after it dropped 2.5 percent from january to march .
ecb staff also upgraded their projections for this year , saying they expected gdp to fall by 4.1 percent in 2009 , a decidedly smaller contraction than the bank had previously predicted .
" there are increasing signs that economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere is stabilizing , " this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilization and very gradual recovery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet says he will keep interest rates where they are for now trichet stressed at the same time , however , that it was too early to end the exceptional ecb measures currently in place to boost the economy .

interest rates to hold asked about how long the ecb would continue with its ultra-loose policies , he told reporters at a news conference : " today is no time to exit .
it is more of a bumpy road ahead .
uncertainty is high .
prudence and caution are still of the essence . "
one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .
reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da mbabi has done well to keep a spot in the national team at such a young age the 21-year-old bajramaj says she tries to use her high public profile to help others . she says she regularly receives letters from german girls with immigrant backgrounds who are looking for help or advice .
" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .

the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhruber is confident lufthansa can benefit from the struggling aua lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , himself an austrian , said the takeover of austrian airlines was a long term decision .
" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .

even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .
although he stayed on as premier and chairman of the cdu in thuringia after the accident , his approval ratings never recovered. th / glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the overall eurozone economy shrank only 0.1 percent in the second quarter , after it dropped 2.5 percent from january to march .
ecb staff also upgraded their projections for this year , saying they expected gdp to fall by 4.1 percent in 2009 , a decidedly smaller contraction than the bank had previously predicted .
" there are increasing signs that economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere is stabilizing , " this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilization and very gradual recovery . "

it is more of a bumpy road ahead .
uncertainty is high .
prudence and caution are still of the essence . "
one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhruber is confident lufthansa can benefit from the struggling aua lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , himself an austrian , said the takeover of austrian airlines was a long term decision .
" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .

circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.09.2009 german town puts student in the mayor 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel zimmermann will swap cologne university for monheim 's town hall residents of the german town of monheim recently elected a 27-year-old phd student as their next mayor .
daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading medical sources say hospitals frequently pay doctors premiums for sending patients their way . the allegations , which both the association of german hospitals -lrb- dkg -rrb- and the central organization of medical self-administration -lrb- baek -rrb- say hold some truth , have sent waves of outrage rippling through germany .
health minister ulla schmidt has called for a quick investigation into the claims .
in an interview with the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper , she said the practice of hospitals paying doctors for particularly lucrative admissions was harmful to patients .
schmidt stressed that it was now up to medical associations to find out just how deep-seated such corruption is .

" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .

recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .

" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .

the united states and european union claim they received no official notification on any new proposals , and on thursday , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi told iran 's official news agency irna that talks would only be conducted with the international atomic energy agency .
" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .
it will go ahead with its program based on international regulations , " he said .
last week , a report issued by the iaea indicated that iran has continued to be unresponsive to the un security council 's demands and that it refuses to cooperate with iaea investigators. mz / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leading medical sources say hospitals frequently pay doctors premiums for sending patients their way . the allegations , which both the association of german hospitals -lrb- dkg -rrb- and the central organization of medical self-administration -lrb- baek -rrb- say hold some truth , have sent waves of outrage rippling through germany .
health minister ulla schmidt has called for a quick investigation into the claims .
in an interview with the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper , she said the practice of hospitals paying doctors for particularly lucrative admissions was harmful to patients .
schmidt stressed that it was now up to medical associations to find out just how deep-seated such corruption is .
deputy health minister klaus theo schroeder told public broadcaster ard that where there was " real evidence , " charges would be brought .
but he said he did not see any need to change the laws currently in place to protect against corruption in the medical industry .
gray areas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hospitals like to have their beds filled dina michels of kkh health insurers said there was an urgent need to tighten legislation .
she told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper that she had never come across a case of a doctor being prosecuted on corruption charges .
michels says doctors are not only engaged in dubious dealings with hospitals , but with health product retailers as well .
she said that in exchange for contracts , some doctors might have their assistants paid for while others might receive a leased car for their wives .
the association of german hospitals , however , says politicians are at least partially to blame for the current situation .
the dkg 's managing director , georg baum , told n24 television news channel that politicians should stop commercializing the relationship between doctors and treatment .
he said schemes by which doctors were rewarded for making medication savings or for not admitting patients to hospital , were teaching them to think in " economic terms .

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.09.2009 african migrants play key role in development cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german office for migration and refugees the migration of african nationals into europe and its impact on europe ’ s population and resources is both a source of concern and recognition of the potential migrants can have to play a role in development cooperation . migration is a significant factor in european population statistics , especially in germany , which hosts the third-highest percentage of international migrants worldwide .
one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .
mixed signals from iran earlier this week , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
the united states and european union claim they received no official notification on any new proposals , and on thursday , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi told iran 's official news agency irna that talks would only be conducted with the international atomic energy agency .
" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .
it will go ahead with its program based on international regulations , " he said .
last week , a report issued by the iaea indicated that iran has continued to be unresponsive to the un security council 's demands and that it refuses to cooperate with iaea investigators. mz / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the film showed interview footage with a former intelligence agent who said becker had given germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , tip-offs leading to the subsequent arrest of two leading raf figures , brigitte mohnhaupt and christian klar .
the man also said becker had provided information about further assassinations planned by the group , sometimes referred to as the baader-meinhof gang .
in return , she received money , which german media reports say amounted to some 100,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 50,000 euros , $ 70,000 -rrb- .
it is not uncommon for the bfv to pay informants to provide information .
wednesday 's disclosure has led to calls from across the political spectrum for interior minister wolfgang schaeuble to release bfv files on becker .
right to view ?
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group said a refusal to release the files led to suspicion that the state had something to hide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the 1977 shooting which left buback and two others dead " i wonder what state interest could be more important than getting to the bottom of a triple murder , " bosbach told the neue osnabruecker zeitung .
in 2007 , the interior ministry rejected an application to release the files , but the prosecutor general 's office has now reapplied and the ministry is apparently thinking it over .
but ministry spokesman stefan paris said the nature of the content meant it was unlikely it could be used in any legal proceedings .
" when the bfv works with informers who come forward to provide information on particular cases , such as ms becker did , it is always under a covenant of secrecy . "
bosbach has also called for clarity over the money becker was allegedly paid for her insider knowledge .
he said he could not understand how the state could fail to punish a lawbreaker and then pay her .
new evidence could lead to closure the 57-year-old ex-baader-meinhof member was first arrested in 1977 after a shoot-out in which she seriously injured a policeman .
she was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder .
investigators looked into becker 's involvement in the buback slaying , but with a lack of evidence linking her to the case , they dropped it in 1980 .
three other raf members were sentenced to long spells in jail for buback 's killing , but police have never established who fired the shots , as the terrorists refused to talk .
becker , meanwhile , was released 12 years into her sentence and had been living in berlin under an assumed name until police turned up new evidence implicating her in the triple murder .
she was arrested again last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police have found fresh evidence linking becker to buback 's murder the authorities say they still do n't believe she fired the shots that killed buback and two others , but they say becker 's dna , which was found on the envelopes of letters claiming responsibility for the crime , link her to it .
michael buback , the son of the murdered prosecutor general , however , believes becker is the assassin the police have been looking for more than three decades .
in an interview with the neue westfaelische newspaper , he said he saw unbelievable mistakes and inadequacies in the futile efforts to find out who killed his father .

the film showed interview footage with a former intelligence agent who said becker had given germany 's domestic intelligence agency , the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- , tip-offs leading to the subsequent arrest of two leading raf figures , brigitte mohnhaupt and christian klar .
the man also said becker had provided information about further assassinations planned by the group , sometimes referred to as the baader-meinhof gang .
in return , she received money , which german media reports say amounted to some 100,000 deutschmarks -lrb- 50,000 euros , $ 70,000 -rrb- .
it is not uncommon for the bfv to pay informants to provide information .
wednesday 's disclosure has led to calls from across the political spectrum for interior minister wolfgang schaeuble to release bfv files on becker .
right to view ?
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the conservatives ' -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group said a refusal to release the files led to suspicion that the state had something to hide .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scene of the 1977 shooting which left buback and two others dead " i wonder what state interest could be more important than getting to the bottom of a triple murder , " bosbach told the neue osnabruecker zeitung .
in 2007 , the interior ministry rejected an application to release the files , but the prosecutor general 's office has now reapplied and the ministry is apparently thinking it over .
but ministry spokesman stefan paris said the nature of the content meant it was unlikely it could be used in any legal proceedings .
" when the bfv works with informers who come forward to provide information on particular cases , such as ms becker did , it is always under a covenant of secrecy . "
bosbach has also called for clarity over the money becker was allegedly paid for her insider knowledge .
he said he could not understand how the state could fail to punish a lawbreaker and then pay her .
new evidence could lead to closure the 57-year-old ex-baader-meinhof member was first arrested in 1977 after a shoot-out in which she seriously injured a policeman .
she was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder .

health minister ulla schmidt has called for a quick investigation into the claims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.09.2009 osnabrueck picks up the pieces after british withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop withdrawal has changed the town 's atmosphere the northern german city of osnabrueck was once the largest british military base outside the uk .
the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.09.2009 osnabrueck picks up the pieces after british withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop withdrawal has changed the town 's atmosphere the northern german city of osnabrueck was once the largest british military base outside the uk .
the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.09.2009 african migrants play key role in development cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german office for migration and refugees the migration of african nationals into europe and its impact on europe ’ s population and resources is both a source of concern and recognition of the potential migrants can have to play a role in development cooperation . migration is a significant factor in european population statistics , especially in germany , which hosts the third-highest percentage of international migrants worldwide .
one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .

high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .

during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .
although he stayed on as premier and chairman of the cdu in thuringia after the accident , his approval ratings never recovered. th / glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .

27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhruber is confident lufthansa can benefit from the struggling aua lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , himself an austrian , said the takeover of austrian airlines was a long term decision .
" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .
mixed signals from iran earlier this week , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
the united states and european union claim they received no official notification on any new proposals , and on thursday , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi told iran 's official news agency irna that talks would only be conducted with the international atomic energy agency .
" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .
it will go ahead with its program based on international regulations , " he said .
last week , a report issued by the iaea indicated that iran has continued to be unresponsive to the un security council 's demands and that it refuses to cooperate with iaea investigators. mz / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .

in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .

he also said inflation would become positive and that interest rates would remain at an historic low of one percent . speaking at the headquarters of the ecb in frankfurt , trichet said the period of contraction for the 16 eurozone economies had come to an end .

trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said inflation would become positive and that interest rates would remain at an historic low of one percent . speaking at the headquarters of the ecb in frankfurt , trichet said the period of contraction for the 16 eurozone economies had come to an end .
the overall eurozone economy shrank only 0.1 percent in the second quarter , after it dropped 2.5 percent from january to march .
ecb staff also upgraded their projections for this year , saying they expected gdp to fall by 4.1 percent in 2009 , a decidedly smaller contraction than the bank had previously predicted .

he warning that it was too early at this point to withdraw support , even as some of europe 's economies , like germany and france , emerge from the recession .
interest rates to hold asked about how long the ecb would continue with its ultra-loose policies , he told reporters at a news conference : " today is no time to exit .
it is more of a bumpy road ahead .
uncertainty is high .
prudence and caution are still of the essence . "
one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhruber is confident lufthansa can benefit from the struggling aua lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , himself an austrian , said the takeover of austrian airlines was a long term decision .
" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .

more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .

merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .

" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .

the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .

" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .
although he stayed on as premier and chairman of the cdu in thuringia after the accident , his approval ratings never recovered. th / glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said inflation would become positive and that interest rates would remain at an historic low of one percent . speaking at the headquarters of the ecb in frankfurt , trichet said the period of contraction for the 16 eurozone economies had come to an end .
the overall eurozone economy shrank only 0.1 percent in the second quarter , after it dropped 2.5 percent from january to march .
ecb staff also upgraded their projections for this year , saying they expected gdp to fall by 4.1 percent in 2009 , a decidedly smaller contraction than the bank had previously predicted .
" there are increasing signs that economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere is stabilizing , " this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilization and very gradual recovery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet says he will keep interest rates where they are for now trichet stressed at the same time , however , that it was too early to end the exceptional ecb measures currently in place to boost the economy .

interest rates to hold asked about how long the ecb would continue with its ultra-loose policies , he told reporters at a news conference : " today is no time to exit .
it is more of a bumpy road ahead .
uncertainty is high .
prudence and caution are still of the essence . "
one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.09.2009 african migrants play key role in development cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german office for migration and refugees the migration of african nationals into europe and its impact on europe ’ s population and resources is both a source of concern and recognition of the potential migrants can have to play a role in development cooperation . migration is a significant factor in european population statistics , especially in germany , which hosts the third-highest percentage of international migrants worldwide .
one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .

people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .

circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .

unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .

some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .

high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .

circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .
reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da mbabi has done well to keep a spot in the national team at such a young age the 21-year-old bajramaj says she tries to use her high public profile to help others . she says she regularly receives letters from german girls with immigrant backgrounds who are looking for help or advice .
" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .

" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .
mixed signals from iran earlier this week , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
the united states and european union claim they received no official notification on any new proposals , and on thursday , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi told iran 's official news agency irna that talks would only be conducted with the international atomic energy agency .
" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .
mixed signals from iran earlier this week , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .

" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .
it will go ahead with its program based on international regulations , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss , " ban said on thursday . fresh from a trip to norway to view the thinning arctic sea ice , ban addressed the world climate conference , which is taking place in geneva . ban said he wants to " raise a sense of urgency " about climate change .
" scientists have been accused for years of scaremongering .
but the real scaremongers are those who say we can not afford climate action - that it will hold back economic growth , " he said .
" they are wrong .
climate change could spell widespread disaster . "

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.09.2009 african migrants play key role in development cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german office for migration and refugees the migration of african nationals into europe and its impact on europe ’ s population and resources is both a source of concern and recognition of the potential migrants can have to play a role in development cooperation . migration is a significant factor in european population statistics , especially in germany , which hosts the third-highest percentage of international migrants worldwide .
one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayrhruber is confident lufthansa can benefit from the struggling aua lufthansa ceo wolfgang mayrhuber , himself an austrian , said the takeover of austrian airlines was a long term decision .
" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.09.2009 osnabrueck picks up the pieces after british withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop withdrawal has changed the town 's atmosphere the northern german city of osnabrueck was once the largest british military base outside the uk .
the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .
in total , the acquisition will cost lufthansa around 220 million euros .

" this is n't a project for just one or two years .
we 're currently burning money ; we 're cash negative .
but we 'll be cash positive next year .
then the aim will be to return to the black at an operating level as quickly as possible , " he said .
in exchange for the takeover , the austrian government has promised to absorb around 500 million euros , or a third of aua 's massive debts . lufthansa to gain from aua 's eastern european flights one of the main reasons why lufthansa decided to buy its rival was its focus on eastern europe , as well as on the middle east .
at present , austrian airlines has the most flights in central and eastern europe .
with its fleet of 91 aircraft , it transported a total of 10.7 million passengers in 2008 .
after acquiring these routes , lufthansa is set to become europe 's number one airline , surpassing air france-klm .
as part of the takeover , however , austrian airlines will be subject to harsh savings measures , including cutting staff by more than 10 percent .
nonetheless , aua chief executive peter malanik stressed that the takeover was a win-win situation - not only for his company and its customers , but also for the austrian economy. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .
reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da mbabi has done well to keep a spot in the national team at such a young age the 21-year-old bajramaj says she tries to use her high public profile to help others . she says she regularly receives letters from german girls with immigrant backgrounds who are looking for help or advice .
" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

the deal makes the lufthansa group europe 's largest carrier . officials from both airlines met at vienna 's international airport on thursday to finalize the deal , which brings an end to more than a year of negotiations .
the merger faced both fierce opposition from rival airlines and anti-trust scrutiny from the european union .
the european commission gave its approval to the bid last week , which cleared all hurdles for the takeover .
to get that approval , however , lufthansa had to agree to a number of conditions , including cutting some flights between vienna and certain destinations in germany and belgium .
long term investment lufthansa agreed to buy 42 percent of aua for a total of 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 532,000 -rrb- , and also to buy out the remaining shareholders at 4.46 euros per share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

" our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss , " ban said on thursday . fresh from a trip to norway to view the thinning arctic sea ice , ban addressed the world climate conference , which is taking place in geneva . ban said he wants to " raise a sense of urgency " about climate change .
" scientists have been accused for years of scaremongering .
but the real scaremongers are those who say we can not afford climate action - that it will hold back economic growth , " he said .
" they are wrong .
climate change could spell widespread disaster . "

" the developed countries should continue to take the lead in undertaking quantified emission reductions commitments , and the developing countries should make contributions as their ability permits , " chinese vice premier hui liangyu said in geneva .
" we need ambitious mid-term mitigation targets by developed countries , " ban said , while developing countries “ need to act to slow the growth of their emissions . "
getting ready for climate change the conference in geneva , which wraps up on friday , brought together delegates and ministers from about 150 countries .
on thursday , attendees passed an agreement which will give developing countries better access to information about climate and weather .
the information could help countries adapt to environmental changes such as floods , wildfires , droughts and disease .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground .
-lrb- 31.08.2009 -rrb- opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.09.2009 poll : merkel 's election lead might not be big enough großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel still has to win over undecided voters after four years of sharing power with the social democrats , chancellor angela merkel has made it clear she 'd like to rule without them .
but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 31.08.2009 -rrb- opinion : merkel 's chances are still good , despite lost ground state ballots in saarland , saxony and thuringia show the christian democrats losing ground , the spd still weak and smaller parties gaining votes .

but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs . merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- hope to combine forces with the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- to form a ruling coalition after the sept .
27 general election .
yet if the election was held today , merkel would n't have enough votes , according to a new emnid poll released on thursday .
support for the cdu has dropped to a three-month low of 34 percent , according to the poll , which is the first to fully take into account the cdu 's setbacks in germany 's recent state and municipal elections .
the fdp held steady at 14 percent .
together , the two parties would pull in only 48 percent of the vote , just shy of a majority .
" i am quite sure merkel will be re-elected but i 'm a lot more cautious about whether she 'll be able to get her preferred coalition with the fdp , " said frank decker , a political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .
yet left-of-center parties fall similarly short , according to the emnid poll .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- would get 26 percent of votes if the elections were held today .
the far-left left party and the greens are polling at 11 percent each .
that also adds up to 48 percent .
swing voters will decide the elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're ruling together , but would rather not yet other polls still give the cdu and fdp an edge over the competition .
the mannheim center for european social research -lrb- mzes -rrb- has said its research gives the cdu and fdp a 52.9 percent majority .
even so , the mzes ' ruediger schmitt-beck said that a conservative victory is far from a sure bet .
" german voters are becoming more willing to cross party lines than in the past , " schmitt-beck said in an interview with germany 's dpa news agency .
" and they 're waiting until later to make up their minds . "
more than 40 percent of voters decide which party they will vote for only a few weeks before they go to the polls , according to mzes research .
that 's a big increase in undecided voters compared to 2005 , when 15 to 18 percent were undecided until late in the election campaign .
in this election , nearly 10 percent of german voters will wait until election day to decide who will get their vote , schmitt-beck told dpa .
conservatives losing ground ?
merkel hopes to avoid a repeat of 2005 , when the christian democrats watched their modest lead slip away in the last weeks leading up to the election .
in the end , she had to accept an uncomfortable coalition with her left-of-center rivals , the spd .
problems for the cdu started on sunday , when voters gave its candidates the cold shoulder in several key state and municipal elections .
the cdu clung to power in the eastern state of saxony .
but it lost support in saarland and thuringia. th / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ali ashgar soltanieh 's comments came a day after a meeting of the united nations security council near frankfurt , where world powers pressured iran to accept face to face talks regarding iran 's nuclear plans .
in addition to the five permanent un security council members , germany was also represented at the meeting .
the six nations are hoping to make progress on the issue before a meeting of the un general assembly meeting later this month .
iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has announced he will be attending the meeting in new york .
mixed signals from iran earlier this week , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator saeed jalili issued a statement saying iran was ready to talk to world powers about an updated nuclear proposal for the country .
the united states and european union claim they received no official notification on any new proposals , and on thursday , foreign ministry spokesman hassan ghashghavi told iran 's official news agency irna that talks would only be conducted with the international atomic energy agency .
" they -lrb- the six world powers -rrb- must understand that the iranian nation and government will not surrender to pressures .
it will go ahead with its program based on international regulations , " he said .
last week , a report issued by the iaea indicated that iran has continued to be unresponsive to the un security council 's demands and that it refuses to cooperate with iaea investigators. mz / reuters / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .
although he stayed on as premier and chairman of the cdu in thuringia after the accident , his approval ratings never recovered. th / glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de poll : merkel 's election lead might not be big enough after four years of sharing power with the social democrats , chancellor angela merkel has made it clear she 'd like to rule without them .
but a new poll suggests she might not get the votes she needs .
-lrb- 03.09.2009 -rrb- merkel 's cdu party experiences setback in state elections just a month before national elections , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats suffered losses in two out of three state elections , while the left-wing left party and the liberal free democrats gained ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.09.2009 osnabrueck picks up the pieces after british withdrawal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the troop withdrawal has changed the town 's atmosphere the northern german city of osnabrueck was once the largest british military base outside the uk .
the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

but since the conservatives lost their absolute majority in state elections in thuringia , althaus has been under pressure to resign . some christian democrats are concerned that their poor showing in thuringia and two other states last sunday could bode ill for their chances in the federal election scheduled for sept .
27 .
while opinion polls suggest chancellor merkel will likely to return to power , she ’ d like to get enough votes to do it without having to enter into another grand coalition with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . but just such a power-sharing scenario looks likely to happen in thuringia .
merkel said as much thursday , when she acknowledged that althaus ’ resignation might be what was needed for coalition talks between the spd and cdu to get going .
the spd had said it wouldn ’ t consider partnering with the cdu in thuringia as long as althaus was in the picture . " the way is clear now for the social democrats to enter into serious discussions with the cdu on the formation of a government , " merkel said .
bildunterschrift : the spd will now decide who will govern in the capital erfurt thuringia state government up in the air while the cdu still has the largest number of votes following sunday 's election in thuringia , the social democrats will likely be the kingmakers .
the spd has said it will hold talks with all parties before deciding on its preferred coalition partner .
spd chancellor candidate frank-walter steinmeier said he sees althaus ’ resignation as “ a consequence of the dramatic losses from last weekend . ”
exploratory discussions between party officials are planned for the coming days , with the spd to talk with the left party on friday and the cdu on saturday .
althaus accident main cause of cdu fallout although the cdu had been long slipping in thuringia opinion polls , the party received a major blow in january when althaus was involved in a skiing accident in austria that resulted in the death of a 41-year-old woman .
althaus himself suffered severe head injuries in the crash and claimed to have no recollection of the event after falling into a brief coma .
he was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and forced to pay fines by an austrian court .
although he stayed on as premier and chairman of the cdu in thuringia after the accident , his approval ratings never recovered. th / glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 03.09.2009 a family-friendly germany : family policy reforms take off großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german birth rate is an average of just 1.37 children per woman the reforms overseen by family minister ursula von der leyen have been well-received .
but their popularity and failure to increase the birth rate only add to the pressure to make germany a better place for families . flipping through the election platform of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , german voters might come across this sentence : " we want more young people in germany to choose to have children . "
not only does incumbent chancellor angela merkel 's party want to create jobs and fight climate change , it also wants lots of german babies .
and it 's not just the cdu .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- also have big campaign promises to make germany more family-friendly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister von der leyen 's reforms are popular the politicians are in the business of baby promotion because germany 's generous social system depends on a steady stream of young workers , whose taxes fund the pensions of the retired and the welfare payments of the unemployed .
but germany has one of the lowest birth rates in the european union with just 1.37 children born per woman in 2008 .
according to sandra fischer , a doctoral student researching federalism and family policy at the university of bonn , a rate of about 2.1 is considered sustainable growth .
merkel 's family minister , ursula von der leyen , whose brief includes senior citizens , women and youth , has been a particularly visible cabinet member in her first term .
she 's pushing through significant reforms aimed at making germany a better place for children and families and boosting the birth rate .
big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

big changes for little people most notably , she introduced a parental allowance , which began in 2007 and pays a parent who chooses to stay home 65 percent of his or her previous income for the first year after a child is born .
the benefit can be extended by two months if the other parent then takes the time off , a measure meant to encourage fathers to take a more active role in child rearing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since parental allowances were instituted , more men have taken paternity leave during the second quarter of 2009 about 35,000 men took advantage of paternity leave , an increase of 29 percent over the previous year .
at the same time , 166,000 women were on maternity leave , 5 percent more than the year before .
fischer says that in these terms von der leyen 's policies were a success . and according to familienmonitor 2009 , a survey of german families published in july , 77 percent of germans thought the parental allowance was a good reform .
christoph kepper , the father of a two-year-old and a six-week-old infant , told deutsche welle he gives the cdu and von der leyen credit for these new policies , although he 's not sure which party he 'll vote for .
" i think germany has made some progress with the parental leave and the parental allowance that they promised .
and they delivered , " he said .
" it 's a nice opportunity to stay home for a few months to take care of your child . "
kepper himself stayed home for two months with his son and plans to do the same with his new daughter .
but when asked whether von der leyen 's reforms played a role in his and his wife 's decision to have children , he was clear : " not at all . "
the family ministry has traditionally gone to the senior party in germany 's governing coalitions .
so after the sept .
27 elections , one of the two big parties , the cdu and the spd , will most likely get the spot .
having just spent the last four years in a grand coalition together and pushing through significant and popular reforms means that their family policy approaches are looking quite similar .
more than just work-life balance despite the major reforms von der leyen has had enacted , germans still want more .
according to familienmonitor 2009 , one in two stay-at-home moms would actually prefer to work , at least part-time .
but rigid work schedules and a lack of dependable , full-time childcare make it difficult to combine family and career .
of those asked by familienmonitor 2009 , 57 percent said that it 's harder to reconcile the two in germany than in other countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german parents complain that it can be difficult to get a spot at nursery schools what families are looking for is compatibility between having a career and having kids , said dr. wilhelm haumann , who led the research for familienmonitor 2009 at the institute for public opinion in allensbach .
" compatibility of family and career is not exactly the same as work-life balance , " he explained .
" it 's more the possibility of bringing the two together . "
kepper , with the two young children , agreed , saying that finding a nursery school or preschool spot can be difficult .
" i think a lot can be done , " he said , referring to making childcare more accessible and better .
more childcare options are the order of the day .
the spd has promised to promote all-day schools , a rarity in a country where school often finishes at 1 p.m. and there are few after-school programs .
the cdu has said it will increase the number of nursery school spots for children under three .
both parties take credit in their election platforms for another recent reform that entitles all children from the age of one onward a nursery school spot , beginning in 2013 .
and both promise to take the program further and provide care for even more children .
regardless of which party wins the family ministry this fall , more childcare options will definitely be on the to-do list .
" i think they will continue to expand it .
it 's a commitment , " fischer said .
" i think they ca n't let it fall under the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 03.09.2009 german town puts student in the mayor 's seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel zimmermann will swap cologne university for monheim 's town hall residents of the german town of monheim recently elected a 27-year-old phd student as their next mayor .
daniel zimmermann , a founder of the tiny peto party , said he was as surprised as anyone by his win . there might not have been much media hype in the weeks leading up to sunday 's mayoral vote in monheim , a town of 43,000 residents just north of cologne .
but the election results sent journalists from around germany scrambling for exclusive interviews with monheim 's new mayor .
it 's not every day that a 27-year-old cologne university student picks up a solid 30.4 percent of the vote .
even more remarkable is the fact that zimmerman 's political party , peto , only has 250 members .
an overnight sensation the last thing zimmermann expected was to win .
but as soon as he answered an early morning phone call congratulating him on his victory , zimmermann realized his doctoral studies were about to be put on ice .
for the next six years , his primary job will be to run the town of monheim .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimmermann has had plenty of media attention in the days since the results were announced , the french and physics teacher has been inundated with media interviews .
once his election victory sunk in , zimmermann said he thought his under-30 status helped him get elected .
" i won not despite my young age , but because of it , " he told deutsche welle .
" i am aware though , that 70 percent did not vote for me . "
but he is not worried about that .
after all , he beat six other candidates including the 31-year-old candidate for the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , tim bruehland .
the cdu had designated bruehland as their candidate in an effort to attract young voters , though he came from the neighboring town of wuelfrath .
as a monheimer , zimmermann had an edge and he picked up 600 more votes , a four-percent lead , over his cdu challenger .
peto founded by default , but not lightweight the peto party – which in latin means " i strive " – only exists in monheim .
zimmermann says he has no ambitions to take the party to the federal level .
peto got its start 10 years ago when zimmermann and four school friends decided they wanted to " do something . "
they were not allowed to form a club or association , because under german law you have to be at least 18 years old and you need seven founding members .
given that zimmerman was only 17 at the time and the group only had five members , they decided to found a political party instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old and young are to work more closely together , says zimmermann " we might have just as easily founded a theater group , " he joked .
in the state of north rhine-westphalia , german and eu nationals aged 16 and above are allowed to take part in state elections .
during the 10 years of peto 's existence , the party became a local political force , zimmermann said .
it backed a successful project to renovate schools , ensured that music classes were offered to all first-year school kids free of charge and secured practice spaces for young bands .
so what are zimmermann 's immediate priorities as mayor ?
" i want to give my town something .
we want to improve children 's day care and upgrade two neglected sports grounds , " he said .
" we also intend to attract more business and retailers to monheim . "
to accommodate monheim 's " mature " citizens , zimmermann has already thought ahead , and set up a " 30 plus " group to make sure the older members of peto do n't feel left out . wl / dpa / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.09.2009 african migrants play key role in development cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german office for migration and refugees the migration of african nationals into europe and its impact on europe ’ s population and resources is both a source of concern and recognition of the potential migrants can have to play a role in development cooperation . migration is a significant factor in european population statistics , especially in germany , which hosts the third-highest percentage of international migrants worldwide .
one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .

the troops ' departure last year left a hole in the community , but also presented new opportunities to the area . over 60 years after first taking up their post in osnabrueck , the last british troops left the town in july .
their departure has had a massive impact , hitting some sectors of the local economy hard .
osnabrueck mayor boris pistorius said that even though the town is beginning to re-occupy and renovate former army buildings , the departure of the brits has been felt in the local community .
" we are noticing more and more that something is missing in our town , " pistorius said .
" i had a lot of contact with the british troops and i miss them because they brought a special culture to the town . "
john lindie , vice-chairman of the local branch of the royal british legion , said that emotions ran high among brits and locals alike when they left .
osnabrueck was now no longer the place it once was , he said .
" for myself and for the members of the royal british legion , it was a very , very sad day , " lindie said .
" it was also a sad day for thousands of osnabruecker , who turned up for the farewell parade in the pouring rain to say goodbye .
osnabrueck is certainly a completely different place since the brits have left . "
" a fantastic opportunity " but not everyone is downcast about the withdrawal of the british troops .
for peter kronemann , managing director of the local retail trade association , the 1.6 million square meters of land -lrb- 17 million square feet -rrb- and 1,250 buildings that the british army left behind are reason enough for optimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the union jack flew over roberts barracks for 63 years " on the whole , the withdrawal of the british troops offers many opportunities for the development of osnabrueck , " he said .
" big , attractive sites have now become available to the private market .
many homes have been released and osnabrueck is hoping that young families previously unable to afford local house prices will occupy these and thus lower the average age in town . "
kronemann is convinced that the science park set to be built on a former barracks site will be of great benefit to the town 's university .
he said that some of the other former army sites would be ideal for industrial use and therefore widen the town 's horizons .
every cloud has a silver lining , as far as mayor pistorius is concerned .
he said that while the departure of the brits was regrettable , it also presented the town with new opportunities and possibilities .
" of course we miss our english friends , " pistorius said .
" but the release of 160 hectares of land , some of it in prime locations , is also a fantastic opportunity for the town . "
impact on the local economy fears that osnabrueck would face a slump when the british troops left have proved unfounded , kronemann said .
of the 200 million euros -lrb- $ 284 million -rrb- the british soldiers earned per year , only 1.7 million euros entered the local economy - and less than one million euros went to retail trade .
given the total turnover of 1.3 billion euros , the british contribution was therefore negligible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor pistorius personally misses the troops , as well " the effects were n't severe , " kronemann said .
" as a whole , the withdrawal of the british troops has not affected retail trade because british purchasing power was relatively small in this sector . "
but lindie said that the economic impact has not been as noticeable as expected because most of the british troops had actually left long before the final withdrawal in july 2008 .
this meant that the british contribution to the local economy dwindled over a long period of time , making losses since last july less noticeable .
" since the end of the cold war and the start of the new local conflicts - kosovo , bosnia , the two gulf wars , afghanistan - the garrison , for about the last 15 years , has actually never been here as a complete garrison , " he said .
" so the actual drawdown did n't affect the town as much as it could have done . "
but some taxi drivers are reporting losses of between 6,000 to 8,000 euros per month because there are no longer hundreds of soldiers needing a lift back to their barracks on friday and saturday nights .
the withdrawal of the british troops has also taken its toll on fast food restaurants , such as the kfc and burger king branches near one of the big barracks , where many soldiers used to go for lunch .
brits sorely missed leaving the economic effects aside , the locals are missing the british presence in osnabrueck on a different level .
there is a general sense that their absence has left a void .
dieter willman , landlord of osnabrueck 's oldest pub " olle use , " said he felt a sense of personal loss even though his turnover was not hit too badly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers often had a drink at olle use " i must say that i miss them , as does everybody , " he said .
" the whole of osnabrueck misses them because we became very close over the years .
i had a certain english clientele with whom i got on very well , but it did n't affect my business too much when they left . "
meanwhile , english culture has become so anchored in osnabrueck that it will remain for many years to come , pistorius said .
" there were many inter-marriages and many children here have at least one english parent , " he said .
" some english families even stayed on after finishing their military service .
so england will always be a part of osnabrueck . "
with an expatriate community of about 4,500 , the brits still have a strong presence in osnabrueck .
and given the popularity of the british soldiers and the loss that the locals feel at their departure , their legacy is set to linger here for a long time to come .

" our foot is stuck on the accelerator and we are heading towards an abyss , " ban said on thursday . fresh from a trip to norway to view the thinning arctic sea ice , ban addressed the world climate conference , which is taking place in geneva . ban said he wants to " raise a sense of urgency " about climate change .
" scientists have been accused for years of scaremongering .
but the real scaremongers are those who say we can not afford climate action - that it will hold back economic growth , " he said .
" they are wrong .

" the developed countries should continue to take the lead in undertaking quantified emission reductions commitments , and the developing countries should make contributions as their ability permits , " chinese vice premier hui liangyu said in geneva .
" we need ambitious mid-term mitigation targets by developed countries , " ban said , while developing countries “ need to act to slow the growth of their emissions . "
getting ready for climate change the conference in geneva , which wraps up on friday , brought together delegates and ministers from about 150 countries .
on thursday , attendees passed an agreement which will give developing countries better access to information about climate and weather .
the information could help countries adapt to environmental changes such as floods , wildfires , droughts and disease .

he also said inflation would become positive and that interest rates would remain at an historic low of one percent . speaking at the headquarters of the ecb in frankfurt , trichet said the period of contraction for the 16 eurozone economies had come to an end .
the overall eurozone economy shrank only 0.1 percent in the second quarter , after it dropped 2.5 percent from january to march .
ecb staff also upgraded their projections for this year , saying they expected gdp to fall by 4.1 percent in 2009 , a decidedly smaller contraction than the bank had previously predicted .
" there are increasing signs that economic activity in the euro area and elsewhere is stabilizing , " this is consistent with the expectation that the significant contraction in economic activity has come to an end and is now followed by a period of stabilization and very gradual recovery . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trichet says he will keep interest rates where they are for now trichet stressed at the same time , however , that it was too early to end the exceptional ecb measures currently in place to boost the economy .

it is more of a bumpy road ahead .
uncertainty is high .
prudence and caution are still of the essence . "
one way the ecb has bolstered eurozone economies is by keeping its interest rates at a record low of one percent .
trichet was adamant that the rates were " appropriate " and added that the ecb would n't raise them until the third quarter next year at the earliest. glb / dpa / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one out of four german citizens in the state of north-rhine westphalia alone have a migrant background , and 30 percent of them are children .
from the 1980s to the present day , germany has experienced an influx of large numbers of immigrants from african nations and that trend is increasing as more and more people migrate to the west largely due to economic hardships in their home countries .
initially , historical precedents determined where africans migrated to - usually the nation 's former colonial power , for instance the large influx of nigerians into britain .
however , since the 1980s the determining factor in african migration has evolved , as africans migrate to countries with which they share no historical or linguistic link .
in fact , african migration is no longer necessarily cross-continental , as statistics show that over 30 percent of africans immigrate to european nations while over 65 percent immigrate to another african nation that is politically more stable and industrialized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fishing boat with african immigrants off the coast of spain viewpoints on african migration have evolved over the decades from being seen as an issue of national security and concern to a phenomenon of great potential .
african diasporas in europe are increasingly recognized now as central in the area of development cooperation .
circular migration - a mutually beneficial solution european migrants with an african background have always played a role in african development cooperation albeit unintentionally through remittances of skilled and well-paid professionals who frequently send money to their home countries to aid their families and communities .
in addition , they often invest in their home countries and set up businesses which have then contributed economically to the area .
" the migrants have helped the millennium development goals , " said leila rispens-noel , of the international alternative financial institutions -lrb- inafi -rrb- , “ more than any government i can think of . "
policy-makers and experts agree that migrants with an african background have a larger role to play in development cooperation in africa .
in this context the concept of circular migration is considered the key to promoting development and is mutually beneficial to african and european nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants in front of an immigration office in southern italy circular migration encompasses the full circle of migration : migrants would be able to come into host countries , go home , and then come back again with few restrictions .
it would alleviate the shortage of labor in eu member nations , cut down on illegal immigration and allow the countries of origin to benefit from the positive impacts of emigration . circular migration would thus foster development and address the problems in african nations which contribute to emigration in the first place .
" people would n't move so much in the first place if the factors making them move to other nations would be fixed , " mariama awumbila , the head of the centre for migration studies at the university of ghana , told deutsche welle .
enabling factors for circular migration the director of africarecruit , titilola banjoko , told deutsche welle that , " full integration into the society is compulsory so migrants can feel secure and productive and be willing to give back to their home countries .
circular migration is possible only with migrants having secure papers and full integration into the society . "
europe 's migrants of african background would be willing to go to their home countries for a while and work there ; lending their expertise in various professions to the economy , if doing so would not jeopardize their chances to return .
" i for instance have a brother who would have been willing to return home for some time and contribute to the economy but he could n't because he did n't have all the secure papers .
if he 'd done so , he could n't have returned due to his insecure papers , " said banjoko .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia " the re-organization of visa systems , ” said armin laschet , the minister for intergenerational affairs in north-rhine westphalia , " would make circular migration work better .
people would n't have to emigrate definitely , they could go back and forth and therefore choose to work in their home countries for a while aiding development cooperation . "
the creation of an enabling environment in the migrants ' home countries is also central to making circular migration work .
" costs for developing businesses in the diasporas home countries should be made reasonable .
hometown associations should make efforts to mobilize diasporas for development , including those who have immigrated to other african countries , " said mariama awumbila .
circular migration may be the triple win concept that ensures gain for the host countries , home countries and the migrants themselves .
nevertheless modified visa policies that are conducive for all the various nations involved are crucial to its success .
" policy for migration is very context-specific .
it 's not one size fits all .
the visa policy must be suitable for every country involved , " said awumbila .
unanswered questions and underdeveloped theory " the boom in debates on circular migration is because many countries are aware they need a comprehensive migration policy .
a 2007 survey conducted by the un to monitor migration policies revealed 13 percent of industrialized nations wanted to raise their number of temporary immigrants and 44 percent of them planned to increase high-skilled migration .
some countries are starting to revise visa policies because of the growing demand for skilled migrants , " dr. steffen angenendt , an analyst for the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low-skilled migrant workers tend to lettuce crops in the us the most important issue on the table in circular migration is whether it would work with both high-skilled and low-skilled migrants .
" if you want to attract high-skilled migrants it makes no sense to do a temporary stay because companies and organizations they work for in europe may want to keep them and offer permanent residency .
high-skilled migrants have the lowest migration barriers anyway .
thus it makes no sense to introduce circular migration to them .
and it 's difficult to predict demand for low-skilled workers and public political support for circular migration programs would be hard to get hold of unless you can identify that demand , " said dr. angenendt .
circular migration has made it on to the political agenda but experts say the factors involved need further fine-tuning to ensure its tenability and success .
" if these things are thought out properly , circular migration could be a very good triple win policy that could really bolster african development .
on-the-job training , earning money in higher currency , getting new ideas through being in a new environment always mean progress .
the precondition is it must be implemented in a way that is non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial , " said dr. angenendt .

her family and colleagues believe the murder was politically motivated .

their paths to the national soccer team took many twists and turns . although they play on the same team on the soccer field their biographies could hardly be more different .
celia okoyino da mbabi , her father from cameroon and her mother french , was born in the western german city of bonn .
at that time the city was the capital of the former west germany , and mbabi says the place had an international feel to it .
she went to a multicultural school , and said she never experienced discrimination because of her dark skin .
" honestly , i 've very rarely experienced any problems because of my multicultural background , " she says .
" in elementary school once or twice maybe , but that 's it .
later , we moved to a small village where everyone knew everyone else , and i played soccer on a team with all the boys .
even there we were all friends . "
meanwhile , fatmire bajramaj was only five when her family fled kosovo and ended up in the western german city of moenchengladbach .
for the petite woman , who goes by the nickname lira , those first few years were tough .
" the german children used to avoid my older brother and i , " she says .
" we were never allowed to play with them , and they 'd always just call us foreigners .
i think our young lives were a bit more troublesome than celia 's .
it was n't until i started to play soccer that people started to give me a little more respect .
since then things have been fine . "
lira went on to be selected for national team honors in 2005 and has since featured in the squad 's midfield .
she has scored three goals for germany and was one of the stars of the 2007 women 's world cup in china .
reaching out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : da mbabi has done well to keep a spot in the national team at such a young age the 21-year-old bajramaj says she tries to use her high public profile to help others . she says she regularly receives letters from german girls with immigrant backgrounds who are looking for help or advice .
" i get e-mails from girls with foreign backgrounds who experienced war , many of them worse than i did , " she says .
" some letters are from girls from morocco or turkey ; some are from small girls who tell me that i 'm their role model .
many ask me how i 've got to where i am , and for me it 's great to be able to help . "
recently , the parents of german national team players , both with and without immigrant backgrounds , gathered to honor their children 's achievements .
both bajramaj and mbabi note with pride that their parents were there to mix with the other parents . mbabi added that mixing with others and working together to fix common problems is one of the best ways to find your place in a new community .
" if people work and play together and can see that they can succeed together , then respect and acceptance will follow .
once you reach that point , a person 's origin plays no role whatsoever , " she says .

the advice allows food and fluids to be withdrawn from patients , who are then continuously sedated , if they are judged to be close to death .
in a letter to the daily telegraph the six doctors and campaigners criticise a " tick-box approach " to care .
the government says the guidance helps deliver high quality care for people .
among the signatories on the letter are ph millard , emeritus professor of geriatrics at the university of london and dr anthony cole , chairman of the medical ethics committee .
from the today programme more from today programme dr peter hargreaves , a consultant in palliative medicine , dr david hill , fellow of the faculty of anaesthetists of the royal college of surgeons , dr elizabeth negus , a lecturer at barking university , and dowager lady salisbury , chairman of choose life , were the other signatories .
their letter says the new treatment pattern of palliative care , based on experience at a liverpool hospice is being rolled out into hospitals and nursing homes .
" if you tick all the right boxes in the liverpool care pathway , the inevitable outcome of the consequent treatment is death , " they write .
" as a result , a nationwide wave of discontent is building up , as family and friends witness the denial of fluids and food to patients . "
a department of health spokesman said they are investing £ 286 million over the two years to help improve end of life care .

climatologists have blamed both the effects of climate change and natural variability .
australia 's bureau of meteorology says that august was a " most extraordinary month " with mean temperatures 2.47c above the long-term average .
august in australia culminated in a record-breaking heat-wave across much of the continent .
in the queensland town of bedourie the temperature reached 38.5c.
elsewhere , new south wales , victoria and south australia have had their warmest winters on record .
we needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically john ridley new south wales farmer blair trewin , from the national climate centre , says the past month has brought unprecedented conditions .
" early last week we saw a number of locations in northern new south wales and southern queensland break their august record-high temperatures by four or five degrees .
and to break records by that sort of margin is something which is extremely rare , " said mr trewin .
scientists believe that such unseasonal temperatures are the result of global warming and of the climate 's natural variability .
there are warnings that spring in this part of the southern hemisphere is likely to bring more hot weather , exacerbating a long-standing drought .
john ridley , a grain farmer in new south wales , is a worried man .
" we needed rain yesterday , right .
we needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential , but most probably been 30 % of our yield potential gone and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically from there , " said mr ridley .
the warm , dry conditions have also prompted the authorities to warn that australia 's annual bushfire season is again likely to be severe .
already serious outbreaks have flared to the north and south of sydney , the country 's most populous city .

climatologists have blamed both the effects of climate change and natural variability .
australia 's bureau of meteorology says that august was a " most extraordinary month " with mean temperatures 2.47c above the long-term average .
august in australia culminated in a record-breaking heat-wave across much of the continent .
in the queensland town of bedourie the temperature reached 38.5c.
elsewhere , new south wales , victoria and south australia have had their warmest winters on record .
we needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically john ridley new south wales farmer blair trewin , from the national climate centre , says the past month has brought unprecedented conditions .
" early last week we saw a number of locations in northern new south wales and southern queensland break their august record-high temperatures by four or five degrees .
and to break records by that sort of margin is something which is extremely rare , " said mr trewin .
scientists believe that such unseasonal temperatures are the result of global warming and of the climate 's natural variability .
there are warnings that spring in this part of the southern hemisphere is likely to bring more hot weather , exacerbating a long-standing drought .
john ridley , a grain farmer in new south wales , is a worried man .
" we needed rain yesterday , right .
we needed rain most probably a fortnight ago for our crops to realise their full potential , but most probably been 30 % of our yield potential gone and every day it does n't rain that will fall quite dramatically from there , " said mr ridley .
the warm , dry conditions have also prompted the authorities to warn that australia 's annual bushfire season is again likely to be severe .
already serious outbreaks have flared to the north and south of sydney , the country 's most populous city .
