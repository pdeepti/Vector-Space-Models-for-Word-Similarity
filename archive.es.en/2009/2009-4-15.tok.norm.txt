the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .
us anti-piracy plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton says pirates ' assets will be tracked down shortly after the arrests , the us secretary of state told a press conference in washington that the us would send an envoy to a somali donors conference this week and seek a broader international effort to fight piracy off the horn of africa .
" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 15.04.2009 german press review : gm corn ban , environmental victory or vote winner ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm opponents fear the effects modified crops may have on other plants and animals germans are divided on the government 's decision to ban genetically modified corn over environmental concerns .
if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .
us anti-piracy plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton says pirates ' assets will be tracked down shortly after the arrests , the us secretary of state told a press conference in washington that the us would send an envoy to a somali donors conference this week and seek a broader international effort to fight piracy off the horn of africa .
" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .

it was not clear whether the greek owners of the vessel paid the pirates a ransom .
the release comes days after another greek ship , the irene em , was taken over by pirates off the somali coast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.04.2009 struggling carmaker opel gains brief respite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel needs an investor if it is to survive the crisis of the auto industry struggling german carmaker opel has reportedly gained a four-month respite due to good sales of its new auto model insignia . the ruesselsheim-based company unexpectedly secured sufficient funds to keep the company afloat for another four months , according to the german daily bild .
opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is under pressure to help opel the german government has repeatedly spoken against a financial bail-out for opel , preferring a private investor or partners from within the industry .
but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .
" we are lifting nothing , " fishermen 's union head marc perrot told afp as he arrived in paris for talks with barnier . "
we will stay in place . " jc / jen , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .

if this fails , washington is reportedly planning to divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .

he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .

" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .

" the fia international court of appeal has decided to deny the appeals , " fia said in a statement after a hearing behind closed doors which took place on tuesday .
the fia ruling confirmed the decision of race stewards at the season-opening australian grand prix on march 29 .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .

the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .

previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .

and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.04.2009 german economy set to shrink dramatically this year , think tank says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is in its worst recession since world war ii .
as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .
by comparison , germany had an almost balanced budget in 2008 . gb / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.04.2009 german economy set to shrink dramatically this year , think tank says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is in its worst recession since world war ii .
as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .
by comparison , germany had an almost balanced budget in 2008 . gb / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think the team has rehabilitated itself , although barcelona 's equalizing goal was needlessly conceded " , said beckenbauer .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .

our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .

" jeers from the fans hurt , " said klinsmann .
" you must present a trophy on the marienplatz -lrb- the munich square where the club traditionally celebrates titles -rrb- . "
" of course such a situation is not comfortable , " the coach said after the match .
" but i understand that after the 4-0 in the first leg people are angry . "
bayern rank second in the bundesliga , three points behind leaders vfl wolfsburg .
with seven matches remaining , klinsmann said every game was now a final for last year 's champions .
" we have to get points , points , points , " klinsmann told reporters .

eleven days ago the bavarians suffered a 5-1 loss to wolfsburg in the bundesliga , a result that followed their dismantling by bayer leverkusen in the german cup in march .
the lagging form has added to speculation that even if klinsmann brings home a national league trophy he could still be axed .
but club president franz beckenbauer , who has not been one of klinsmann 's most ardent supporters , tried to take some pressure off his coach .
" i would not be angry if we did not win the bundesliga after this year of confusion , " beckenbauer said after the barcelona match .

tuesday 's game ended 1-1 as bayern failed once again to make the final four in europe 's top tournament since winning the trophy in 2001 .
bayern 's failure to push on in europe this year underlined that the club 's reliance on french star franck ribery would not bring it any trophies beyond the bundesliga , and that the club needed to bolster its attacking and defensive ranks .
" we know in which areas we must improve when we start again in the champions league next year ...
we definitely need two or three top players .
we are working on that , " said klinsmann .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .

" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "

previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

the fia court of appeal " concluded that the stewards were correct to find that the cars in question comply with the applicable regulations . "
fia said it would provide full reasons for its ruling " in due course . "
the diffuser is an aerodynamic feature which channels air out of the back of the chassis .
it affects a formula one car 's down force which in turn enhances speed and performance .
wednesday 's ruling will prompt other teams to redesign their cars as soon as possible .

it went on : " we also made full use of the consultation procedure with the fia which was a helpful process to ensure our interpretation of the technical regulations was correct .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .
" we are lifting nothing , " fishermen 's union head marc perrot told afp as he arrived in paris for talks with barnier . "

however , no soccer miracle was forthcoming against the seasoned spaniards who equalized in the 73rd minute with a goal by seydou keita .
" the best team in the world " " of course we had a tiny hope we did not dare mention , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann , who was booed by fans , told reporters .
" at the end i was satisfied with the way we played barcelona .
we went out to a team that is one class above us , probably the best in the world , " said klinsmann .
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer - who was scathing after the first-leg debacle - said the germans had gone some way to redemption .
" i think the team has rehabilitated itself , although barcelona 's equalizing goal was needlessly conceded " , said beckenbauer .

it went on : " we also made full use of the consultation procedure with the fia which was a helpful process to ensure our interpretation of the technical regulations was correct .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.04.2009 swiss bank ubs to slash over 8,000 jobs as losses mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs : trouble , writ large after struggling to recover from losing billions in the economic crisis , switzerland 's biggest bank , ubs , on wednesday said it would slash 8,700 jobs in a bid to " make substantial cost savings " amid fresh losses . the bank , seeking to " realize substantial cost savings in all areas " after posting losses for the first quarter of about two billion swiss francs -lrb- 1.32 billion euros , $ 1.75 billion -rrb- , revealed that its latest job cull would help it trim costs by up to four billion francs .
" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ubs warns us tax fraud battle could be its ruin a swiss court has temporarily banned ubs from transferring any customer data to us authorities until it has heard a protest brought by bank clients .
the bank 's lawyers said complying with the us would be very costly .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .

the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .

previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .

german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is under pressure to help opel the german government has repeatedly spoken against a financial bail-out for opel , preferring a private investor or partners from within the industry .
but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .
german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .
surgical gm bankcrupty looming opel 's us parent company gm is scrambling to find a third-party investor for its european arm ahead of a 60-day us government deadline to cut back costs and operations or face a " surgical bankruptcy " .
gm , which is operating with 13.4 billion dollars in emergency federal loans , has until june 1 to win concessions from creditors and the auto workers ' union .
if this fails , washington is reportedly planning to divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .
gm has lost some 80 billion dollars over the past four years .
however , the company has been brought to the brink only in the last few months as the us recession drove us car sales to 25-year lows . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .
by comparison , germany had an almost balanced budget in 2008 . gb / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .

but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .

the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .

salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .
tough options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams say unclear rules means it 's not a level playing field this season if the fia , however , rules that the diffusers are legal , then seven teams , including ferrari , red bull , renault , mclaren mercedes and bmw sauber will have to redevelop their cars at a huge cost as soon as possible .
the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .
" you ca n't miss the dominance of teams who are using the new designs .
the fia must make a clear decision as quickly as possible .
sport is only interesting if everyone plays by the same rules . "
mclaren mercedes , anticipating a possible defeat for the challenging teams , has already begun work on developing a new diffuser for its team in an effort to stay competitive for the current season .
" but it 's like running a 100 meter race with a ten meter headstart by the competition , " said mercedes ' head of sports , norbert haug . wl / jen / nk , dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .
" we are lifting nothing , " fishermen 's union head marc perrot told afp as he arrived in paris for talks with barnier . "

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .

the law , passed last month , says a husband can demand sex with his wife every four days unless she is ill or would be harmed by intercourse - a clause that critics say legalizes marital rape .
it also regulates when and for what reasons a wife may leave her home alone .
women 's rights activists scheduled a protest wednesday attended by mostly young women .
but the group was swamped by counter-protesters - both men and women - who shouted down the women 's chants .
witnesses told dpa news service that at least three people were wounded by police gunshots in western kabul when a group of young shiite men tried to stop schoolgirls who were on their way to join the protest against the shiite family law .

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .

" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .
us anti-piracy plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton says pirates ' assets will be tracked down shortly after the arrests , the us secretary of state told a press conference in washington that the us would send an envoy to a somali donors conference this week and seek a broader international effort to fight piracy off the horn of africa .
" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .
greek release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atalanta involves troops and ships from several european nations in related news , a greek freighter seized by pirates off the coast of somalia four weeks ago has been released , greece 's state-run net radio reported wednesday .
the broadcaster quoted coast guard officials as saying the titan was freed on wednesday evening along with its crew of 24 .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" jeers from the fans hurt , " said klinsmann .
" you must present a trophy on the marienplatz -lrb- the munich square where the club traditionally celebrates titles -rrb- . "
" of course such a situation is not comfortable , " the coach said after the match .
" but i understand that after the 4-0 in the first leg people are angry . "
bayern rank second in the bundesliga , three points behind leaders vfl wolfsburg .
with seven matches remaining , klinsmann said every game was now a final for last year 's champions .
" we have to get points , points , points , " klinsmann told reporters .
" we have to get maximum points and i still believe we will win the championship . "
escalating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg walked all over bayern at the volkswagon arena but bayern 's defeat to barca is not the only factor behind the ramped up pressure on klinsmann .
eleven days ago the bavarians suffered a 5-1 loss to wolfsburg in the bundesliga , a result that followed their dismantling by bayer leverkusen in the german cup in march .
the lagging form has added to speculation that even if klinsmann brings home a national league trophy he could still be axed .
but club president franz beckenbauer , who has not been one of klinsmann 's most ardent supporters , tried to take some pressure off his coach .
" i would not be angry if we did not win the bundesliga after this year of confusion , " beckenbauer said after the barcelona match .
" but we need the champions league -lrb- qualification spot -rrb- . "
new stars needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern conceded they need more stars in addition to franck ribery in europe , bayern 's deficits were brutally exposed by barca last week when the catalans won the first leg 4-0 .
tuesday 's game ended 1-1 as bayern failed once again to make the final four in europe 's top tournament since winning the trophy in 2001 .
bayern 's failure to push on in europe this year underlined that the club 's reliance on french star franck ribery would not bring it any trophies beyond the bundesliga , and that the club needed to bolster its attacking and defensive ranks .
" we know in which areas we must improve when we start again in the champions league next year ...
we definitely need two or three top players .
we are working on that , " said klinsmann .

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .

the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .

the fia ruling confirmed the decision of race stewards at the season-opening australian grand prix on march 29 .
the fia court of appeal " concluded that the stewards were correct to find that the cars in question comply with the applicable regulations . "

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de ubs warns us tax fraud battle could be its ruin a swiss court has temporarily banned ubs from transferring any customer data to us authorities until it has heard a protest brought by bank clients .
the bank 's lawyers said complying with the us would be very costly .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .
tough options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams say unclear rules means it 's not a level playing field this season if the fia , however , rules that the diffusers are legal , then seven teams , including ferrari , red bull , renault , mclaren mercedes and bmw sauber will have to redevelop their cars at a huge cost as soon as possible .
the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .
" you ca n't miss the dominance of teams who are using the new designs .
the fia must make a clear decision as quickly as possible .
sport is only interesting if everyone plays by the same rules . "
mclaren mercedes , anticipating a possible defeat for the challenging teams , has already begun work on developing a new diffuser for its team in an effort to stay competitive for the current season .
" but it 's like running a 100 meter race with a ten meter headstart by the competition , " said mercedes ' head of sports , norbert haug . wl / jen / nk , dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .

a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .
imf chief has no problems with poland 's request bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauss-kahn said poland had a solid financial record imf head dominique strauss-kahn welcomed poland 's move , noting its " economic fundamentals and policy framework are strong , and the polish authorities have demonstrated a commitment to maintaining this solid record . "
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .
a loan for poland is a loan for stability , say analysts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a stable nation in a region of financial instability poland is a rarity because it expects economic growth this year .
warsaw has been battling to dissociate itself from the grim regional picture in other eastern european states that are facing some of the sharpest recessions in the eu .
" polish fundamentals stand out relative to regional peers , " said manik narain , an analyst at standard chartered , in a statement .
independent polish analyst marek zuber told afp that " if one bolsters poland , one bolsters the whole region . "
" a loan to poland is n't a loan to one country ...
it 's about boosting the strongest link , " he added .
the economy of this country of 38 million people has been in robust health over recent years , notably since the ex-communist state joined the european union in 2004 .
in 2007 it grew 6.7 percent .
in 2008 the rate was a still-credible 4.8 percent .
polish authorities forecast growth of between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent this year while the european commission , the 27-nation eu 's executive body , is expecting around 2.0 percent .
keeping the zloty afloat despite the relatively rosy outlook , poland 's currency , the zloty , has found itself under attack .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .
imf chief has no problems with poland 's request bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauss-kahn said poland had a solid financial record imf head dominique strauss-kahn welcomed poland 's move , noting its " economic fundamentals and policy framework are strong , and the polish authorities have demonstrated a commitment to maintaining this solid record . "
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .

" polish fundamentals stand out relative to regional peers , " said manik narain , an analyst at standard chartered , in a statement .
independent polish analyst marek zuber told afp that " if one bolsters poland , one bolsters the whole region . "
" a loan to poland is n't a loan to one country ...

in 2007 it grew 6.7 percent .
in 2008 the rate was a still-credible 4.8 percent .
polish authorities forecast growth of between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent this year while the european commission , the 27-nation eu 's executive body , is expecting around 2.0 percent .

although the spaniards came to munich with a virtually unbeatable 4-0 advantage from the first-leg at the nou camp , bayern remained defiant with playmaker franck ribery scoring the match 's first goal in the 47th minute .
however , no soccer miracle was forthcoming against the seasoned spaniards who equalized in the 73rd minute with a goal by seydou keita .
" the best team in the world " " of course we had a tiny hope we did not dare mention , " bayern coach juergen klinsmann , who was booed by fans , told reporters .
" at the end i was satisfied with the way we played barcelona .
we went out to a team that is one class above us , probably the best in the world , " said klinsmann .
bayern munich president franz beckenbauer - who was scathing after the first-leg debacle - said the germans had gone some way to redemption .
" i think the team has rehabilitated itself , although barcelona 's equalizing goal was needlessly conceded " , said beckenbauer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann has been facing mounting criticism pressure has been mounting on klinsmann following disastrous results both in the bundesliga and the champions league.bayern entered the maelstrom on april 4 , when they were humiliated 5-1 by bundesliga front-runners wolfsburg .
they subsequently suffered the afore mentioned 4-0 thrashing by barcelona in the first leg of the champions league quarter-final which bayern 's club chairman karl-heinz rummenigge described as a football " lesson " .
at this stage german media were seriously questionning whether klinsmann was past his sell-by-date as bayern coach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.04.2009 swiss bank ubs to slash over 8,000 jobs as losses mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs : trouble , writ large after struggling to recover from losing billions in the economic crisis , switzerland 's biggest bank , ubs , on wednesday said it would slash 8,700 jobs in a bid to " make substantial cost savings " amid fresh losses . the bank , seeking to " realize substantial cost savings in all areas " after posting losses for the first quarter of about two billion swiss francs -lrb- 1.32 billion euros , $ 1.75 billion -rrb- , revealed that its latest job cull would help it trim costs by up to four billion francs .
" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the law , passed last month , says a husband can demand sex with his wife every four days unless she is ill or would be harmed by intercourse - a clause that critics say legalizes marital rape .
it also regulates when and for what reasons a wife may leave her home alone .
women 's rights activists scheduled a protest wednesday attended by mostly young women .
but the group was swamped by counter-protesters - both men and women - who shouted down the women 's chants .
witnesses told dpa news service that at least three people were wounded by police gunshots in western kabul when a group of young shiite men tried to stop schoolgirls who were on their way to join the protest against the shiite family law .

" jeers from the fans hurt , " said klinsmann .
" you must present a trophy on the marienplatz -lrb- the munich square where the club traditionally celebrates titles -rrb- . "
" of course such a situation is not comfortable , " the coach said after the match .
" but i understand that after the 4-0 in the first leg people are angry . "
bayern rank second in the bundesliga , three points behind leaders vfl wolfsburg .
with seven matches remaining , klinsmann said every game was now a final for last year 's champions .
" we have to get points , points , points , " klinsmann told reporters .
" we have to get maximum points and i still believe we will win the championship . "
escalating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg walked all over bayern at the volkswagon arena but bayern 's defeat to barca is not the only factor behind the ramped up pressure on klinsmann .
eleven days ago the bavarians suffered a 5-1 loss to wolfsburg in the bundesliga , a result that followed their dismantling by bayer leverkusen in the german cup in march .
the lagging form has added to speculation that even if klinsmann brings home a national league trophy he could still be axed .
but club president franz beckenbauer , who has not been one of klinsmann 's most ardent supporters , tried to take some pressure off his coach .
" i would not be angry if we did not win the bundesliga after this year of confusion , " beckenbauer said after the barcelona match .
" but we need the champions league -lrb- qualification spot -rrb- . "
new stars needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern conceded they need more stars in addition to franck ribery in europe , bayern 's deficits were brutally exposed by barca last week when the catalans won the first leg 4-0 .
tuesday 's game ended 1-1 as bayern failed once again to make the final four in europe 's top tournament since winning the trophy in 2001 .
bayern 's failure to push on in europe this year underlined that the club 's reliance on french star franck ribery would not bring it any trophies beyond the bundesliga , and that the club needed to bolster its attacking and defensive ranks .
" we know in which areas we must improve when we start again in the champions league next year ...
we definitely need two or three top players .
we are working on that , " said klinsmann .
" but now we must concentrate on the bundesliga and win points there . " dfm / jen , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .

previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .
german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.04.2009 struggling carmaker opel gains brief respite großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel needs an investor if it is to survive the crisis of the auto industry struggling german carmaker opel has reportedly gained a four-month respite due to good sales of its new auto model insignia . the ruesselsheim-based company unexpectedly secured sufficient funds to keep the company afloat for another four months , according to the german daily bild .
opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is under pressure to help opel the german government has repeatedly spoken against a financial bail-out for opel , preferring a private investor or partners from within the industry .
but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.04.2009 swiss bank ubs to slash over 8,000 jobs as losses mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs : trouble , writ large after struggling to recover from losing billions in the economic crisis , switzerland 's biggest bank , ubs , on wednesday said it would slash 8,700 jobs in a bid to " make substantial cost savings " amid fresh losses . the bank , seeking to " realize substantial cost savings in all areas " after posting losses for the first quarter of about two billion swiss francs -lrb- 1.32 billion euros , $ 1.75 billion -rrb- , revealed that its latest job cull would help it trim costs by up to four billion francs .
" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .

salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the fia international court of appeal has decided to deny the appeals , " fia said in a statement after a hearing behind closed doors which took place on tuesday .
the fia ruling confirmed the decision of race stewards at the season-opening australian grand prix on march 29 .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .

he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 15.04.2009 german press review : gm corn ban , environmental victory or vote winner ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm opponents fear the effects modified crops may have on other plants and animals germans are divided on the government 's decision to ban genetically modified corn over environmental concerns .
if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .
tough options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams say unclear rules means it 's not a level playing field this season if the fia , however , rules that the diffusers are legal , then seven teams , including ferrari , red bull , renault , mclaren mercedes and bmw sauber will have to redevelop their cars at a huge cost as soon as possible .
the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .
" you ca n't miss the dominance of teams who are using the new designs .
the fia must make a clear decision as quickly as possible .
sport is only interesting if everyone plays by the same rules . "
mclaren mercedes , anticipating a possible defeat for the challenging teams , has already begun work on developing a new diffuser for its team in an effort to stay competitive for the current season .

" the fia international court of appeal has decided to deny the appeals , " fia said in a statement after a hearing behind closed doors which took place on tuesday .
the fia ruling confirmed the decision of race stewards at the season-opening australian grand prix on march 29 .
the fia court of appeal " concluded that the stewards were correct to find that the cars in question comply with the applicable regulations . "
fia said it would provide full reasons for its ruling " in due course . "
the diffuser is an aerodynamic feature which channels air out of the back of the chassis .
it affects a formula one car 's down force which in turn enhances speed and performance .
wednesday 's ruling will prompt other teams to redesign their cars as soon as possible .

" we respect the right of our competitors to query any design or concept used on our cars through the channels available to them . "
" the fia technical department , the stewards at the australian and malaysian grand prix and now five judges at the international court of appeal have confirmed our belief that our cars have always strictly complied with the 2009 technical regulations , " the statement said .
brawn added that the decisison " brings this matter to its conclusion and we look forward to continuing on the track the challenge of what has been a very exciting start to the 2009 fia formula one world championship . "
williams , toyota also involved the controversial diffuser was also fitted to the cars of the williams and toyota teams , and toyota said they had always been confident of the outcome going in their favor .
" as we have maintained throughout , our team studied the wording of the new 2009 regulations in precise detail to ensure we interpreted them correctly , " a statement from the japanese team , which is based in cologne , germany , said .
it went on : " we also made full use of the consultation procedure with the fia which was a helpful process to ensure our interpretation of the technical regulations was correct .
toyota glad to see the back of f1 's " challenging time " " therefore we had every confidence that the design of our car would be confirmed as legal , firstly by race stewards in australia and malaysia and subsequently by the court of appeal . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toyota 's timo glock -lrb- far right -rrb- has also benefited toyota team boss tadashi yamashina welcomed the fia ruling .

it is important to stress we studied the technical regulations in precise detail , consulting the fia in our process , and never doubted our car complied with them , " he said in a team statement .
" this has been a challenging period for formula 1 and i am pleased this issue is now in the past and we can focus on an exciting season on the track , " he said , as the teams could have lost all their points had the diffuser been deemed illegal .
but renault 's double world champion fernando alonso warned that if the diffuser design is ruled legal the championship " could be more or less decided " because " the brawns are going to be nearly unreachable for any other team . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.04.2009 german economy set to shrink dramatically this year , think tank says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is in its worst recession since world war ii .
as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.04.2009 swiss bank ubs to slash over 8,000 jobs as losses mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs : trouble , writ large after struggling to recover from losing billions in the economic crisis , switzerland 's biggest bank , ubs , on wednesday said it would slash 8,700 jobs in a bid to " make substantial cost savings " amid fresh losses . the bank , seeking to " realize substantial cost savings in all areas " after posting losses for the first quarter of about two billion swiss francs -lrb- 1.32 billion euros , $ 1.75 billion -rrb- , revealed that its latest job cull would help it trim costs by up to four billion francs .
" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

but four german states with opel factories are seeking ways to save up to 50,000 jobs linked to opel and its supply chain .
german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .
opel also has plants in belgium , spain and the united kingdom , where it makes vauxhall brand cars .

german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .
but merkel has warned that she wo n't be party to a holzmann-style bailout , in which her predecessor gerhard schroeder engineered a last minute deal to save the frankfurt construction giant , only to watch it collapse less than three years later .
surgical gm bankcrupty looming opel 's us parent company gm is scrambling to find a third-party investor for its european arm ahead of a 60-day us government deadline to cut back costs and operations or face a " surgical bankruptcy " .
gm , which is operating with 13.4 billion dollars in emergency federal loans , has until june 1 to win concessions from creditors and the auto workers ' union .
if this fails , washington is reportedly planning to divide gm 's " good " assets from its unhealthy ones .
gm has lost some 80 billion dollars over the past four years .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .
tough options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams say unclear rules means it 's not a level playing field this season if the fia , however , rules that the diffusers are legal , then seven teams , including ferrari , red bull , renault , mclaren mercedes and bmw sauber will have to redevelop their cars at a huge cost as soon as possible .
the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .
" you ca n't miss the dominance of teams who are using the new designs .
the fia must make a clear decision as quickly as possible .
sport is only interesting if everyone plays by the same rules . "
mclaren mercedes , anticipating a possible defeat for the challenging teams , has already begun work on developing a new diffuser for its team in an effort to stay competitive for the current season .
" but it 's like running a 100 meter race with a ten meter headstart by the competition , " said mercedes ' head of sports , norbert haug . wl / jen / nk , dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .

he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .
they 're not intrusive and fit into many cultural contexts . " before long , ikea had become a synonym for people 's first furniture purchase . " the first step was cinder blocks and boards , " recalled roesner .
" as soon as we had a little bit of money , we went to ikea . " the democratic design - ikea exhibition runs through july 12 , 2009 , in the museum pinakothek der moderne in munich .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .

"
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .
imf chief has no problems with poland 's request bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauss-kahn said poland had a solid financial record imf head dominique strauss-kahn welcomed poland 's move , noting its " economic fundamentals and policy framework are strong , and the polish authorities have demonstrated a commitment to maintaining this solid record . "
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .
a loan for poland is a loan for stability , say analysts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a stable nation in a region of financial instability poland is a rarity because it expects economic growth this year .
warsaw has been battling to dissociate itself from the grim regional picture in other eastern european states that are facing some of the sharpest recessions in the eu .
" polish fundamentals stand out relative to regional peers , " said manik narain , an analyst at standard chartered , in a statement .
independent polish analyst marek zuber told afp that " if one bolsters poland , one bolsters the whole region . "
" a loan to poland is n't a loan to one country ...

and not just for the museum ! " indeed , this is the first time a museum has made ikea the subject of an exhibition . billy 's roots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 28 million billy shelves have been sold corinna roesner , one of the curators of the exhibition , said the combination of the museum 's permanent design exhibition and ikea pieces was particularly interesting , because visitors could recognize where many of the ideas came from for furniture pieces they are familiar with . " since the end of the 1980s , we 've collected pieces from ikea - very selectively , of course , " said roesner of die neue sammlung - the international design museum munich , which presented the show in collaboration with ikea .
" half of the items -lsb- in the exhibition -rsb- come from our collection and the other half from the ikea museum or private lenders . " it 's one of the few design shows where a large number of visitors can say that they , too , own an original .
for most , it 's the " billy " shelves in white .
they have been sold 28 million times since ikea opened in 1948 . design philosophy that sells in 1943 , at the age of 17 , ingvar kamprad started off selling odds and ends like pencils and matches .
a few years later , ikea 's founder discovered his ticket to success : furniture that could be packed flat in a box . kamprad , who lives in switzerland , is now one of the wealthiest individuals in the world . ikea design , however , is more than just a successful business strategy .
one decisive element is that it combines various schools of design that would n't otherwise be juxtaposed .
natural , wood-based swedish modernism is combined , for example , with international movements such as post-modernism . bildunterschrift : the ikea look fits into to many different cultures a concept for practically every culture " the amazing thing is that it works in dubai the same way it works in shanghai , and in germany just like in the us , " said roesner .
" i think one factor is the light , no-frills approach that the pieces have , because they 're part of this scandinavian design tradition .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .
by comparison , germany had an almost balanced budget in 2008 . gb / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opel was reportedly able to accumulate a small financial cushion , neutralizing financial threats that were expected to hit the company in may , due to good sales of its new insignia model .
the new funds would temporarily ensure opel 's financial stability in the event of an insolvency of the us parent company general motors , according to bild .
the chairman of opel 's works council , klaus franz , was quoted as saying that " liquidity has been secured .
we have time to build opel europe . "
previous reports suggested that the carmaker required urgent financial aid by may if it was to survive the current crisis of the auto industry .
opel , which employs about 25,000 people in germany , has said it needs 3.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- in state aid from european governments to save jobs and keep plants open .

german chancellor angela merkel , who faces an election in september , is under pressure to help opel , which traces its roots back to the 19th century .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .
imf chief has no problems with poland 's request bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauss-kahn said poland had a solid financial record imf head dominique strauss-kahn welcomed poland 's move , noting its " economic fundamentals and policy framework are strong , and the polish authorities have demonstrated a commitment to maintaining this solid record . "
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .
a loan for poland is a loan for stability , say analysts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a stable nation in a region of financial instability poland is a rarity because it expects economic growth this year .
warsaw has been battling to dissociate itself from the grim regional picture in other eastern european states that are facing some of the sharpest recessions in the eu .
" polish fundamentals stand out relative to regional peers , " said manik narain , an analyst at standard chartered , in a statement .
independent polish analyst marek zuber told afp that " if one bolsters poland , one bolsters the whole region . "
" a loan to poland is n't a loan to one country ...
it 's about boosting the strongest link , " he added .
the economy of this country of 38 million people has been in robust health over recent years , notably since the ex-communist state joined the european union in 2004 .
in 2007 it grew 6.7 percent .
in 2008 the rate was a still-credible 4.8 percent .
polish authorities forecast growth of between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent this year while the european commission , the 27-nation eu 's executive body , is expecting around 2.0 percent .
keeping the zloty afloat despite the relatively rosy outlook , poland 's currency , the zloty , has found itself under attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and the zloty took a battering earlier this year in mid-february it plunged to a five-year low point of 4.92 to the euro - marking a 40-percent fall since july 2008 and making it the world 's most beleaguered currency despite the recession-bucking forecasts .
at the time , warsaw announced it was prepared to intervene if the zloty fell to 5.0 to the euro - and the government subsequently made what it called a " routine " sale of euros from its coffers , pulling the rate back to 4.68 , and it has since climbed further .
poland 's government has some 150 billion zlotys -lrb- currently 35 billion euros , $ 46 billion -rrb- of debt to refinance in 2009 and some analysts had earlier voiced fears the credit crunch may put strong upward pressure on the yields offered by the country of 38 million . nda / ncy , ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .

" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

" jeers from the fans hurt , " said klinsmann .
" you must present a trophy on the marienplatz -lrb- the munich square where the club traditionally celebrates titles -rrb- . "
" of course such a situation is not comfortable , " the coach said after the match .
" but i understand that after the 4-0 in the first leg people are angry . "
bayern rank second in the bundesliga , three points behind leaders vfl wolfsburg .
with seven matches remaining , klinsmann said every game was now a final for last year 's champions .
" we have to get points , points , points , " klinsmann told reporters .
" we have to get maximum points and i still believe we will win the championship . "
escalating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg walked all over bayern at the volkswagon arena but bayern 's defeat to barca is not the only factor behind the ramped up pressure on klinsmann .
eleven days ago the bavarians suffered a 5-1 loss to wolfsburg in the bundesliga , a result that followed their dismantling by bayer leverkusen in the german cup in march .
the lagging form has added to speculation that even if klinsmann brings home a national league trophy he could still be axed .
but club president franz beckenbauer , who has not been one of klinsmann 's most ardent supporters , tried to take some pressure off his coach .
" i would not be angry if we did not win the bundesliga after this year of confusion , " beckenbauer said after the barcelona match .
" but we need the champions league -lrb- qualification spot -rrb- . "
new stars needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern conceded they need more stars in addition to franck ribery in europe , bayern 's deficits were brutally exposed by barca last week when the catalans won the first leg 4-0 .
tuesday 's game ended 1-1 as bayern failed once again to make the final four in europe 's top tournament since winning the trophy in 2001 .
bayern 's failure to push on in europe this year underlined that the club 's reliance on french star franck ribery would not bring it any trophies beyond the bundesliga , and that the club needed to bolster its attacking and defensive ranks .
" we know in which areas we must improve when we start again in the champions league next year ...
we definitely need two or three top players .
we are working on that , " said klinsmann .
" but now we must concentrate on the bundesliga and win points there . " dfm / jen , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .

" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .

" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "

previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

the operation took place some 900 kilometers east of the kenyan port of mombasa when french sailors seized the 10-meter-long pirate mother ship , which had been carrying a large reserve of petrol and two " assault skiffs , " the ministry said in a statement .
the 11 pirates were arrested and transferred to the french frigate , the nivose .
they were first spotted late tuesday when a helicopter from the nivose helped ward off an attack on a freighter sailing under a liberian flag .
the helicopter then followed the attack boats back to the mother-ship .
captain christophe prazuck said this was the ninth french operation against piracy in the past year and in total the navy had taken 74 suspects out of circulation , killing three and handing the rest to the relevant authorities . pirates caught after attacks on french nationals are brought back to france for trial , while others are handed over to african officials .
the nivose is one of eight european warships taking part in operation atalanta , which is aimed at halting pirate attacks on private and commercial vessels in the indian ocean .
german , spanish and italian forces are also involved in the eu operation .
us anti-piracy plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state hillary clinton says pirates ' assets will be tracked down shortly after the arrests , the us secretary of state told a press conference in washington that the us would send an envoy to a somali donors conference this week and seek a broader international effort to fight piracy off the horn of africa .
" we may be dealing with a 17th-century crime , but we need to bring 21st century assets to bear , " clinton told reporters at the state department .
" our envoy will work with other partners to help the somalis assist us in cracking down on pirate bases and in decreasing incentives for young somali men to engage in piracy , " she said .
greek release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : atalanta involves troops and ships from several european nations in related news , a greek freighter seized by pirates off the coast of somalia four weeks ago has been released , greece 's state-run net radio reported wednesday .

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .
a fine kettle of fish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the blockaders want paris to override the eu quotas france 's agriculture and fishing minister michel barnier has invited union representatives to paris for crisis talks .
but the seamen are sceptical , believing that minister is not open to negotiations on the quotas .
meanwhile , on the other side of the english channel , traffic is backed for miles as would-be ferry travellers wait for service to french ports to be resumed .
some people have even been forced to sleep in their cars .
" it 's typical , " one disgruntled traveller , 62-year-old margaret eden , told afp news agency .
" every time there 's a problem , the french try to blockade the ports and stop tourists going to france , but we have no say over the issue . "
ferry operators not amused english ferry operators , who are losing revenues , are also not amused at all by the french government 's inability to settle the quarrel with the fishermen and their allies .
" i can not remember a blockade quite as bad as this and we are looking at the possibility of seeking compensation from the french authorities , " brian rees - a spokesman for p and o ferry lines - told afp .
in fact , on wednesday , march 15 , british and french shipping companies won a court ruling ordering the 100-strong flotilla blocking calais and boulogne ferry terminals to allow cross-channel services to resume .
but the fishermen 's representatives say they will not be deterred .
" we are lifting nothing , " fishermen 's union head marc perrot told afp as he arrived in paris for talks with barnier . "

it 's the latest strategy in a two-day-old strike . having blockaded the french ports of calais , boulogne and dunkerque , the french union cfdt says it 's prepared to go one step further and hinder traffic through the tunnel .
" out of solidarity with the fishermen , if they reach no deal with the government … , we 'll go and block the tunnel on thursday morning , until there is a deal , " cfdt spokesman eric verckourtre told afp news agency .
the union is demanding that the french government reconsider eu fishing quotas , which labor representatives say are forcing fishermen out of work .
in particular , the fishermen want increased quotas on the number of cod and dover sole that can be legally caught .
the industrial action has already all but shut down ferry services between england and france and left most of the ships stranded in english ports .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .

ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "

previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .

iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has said he will shortly offer the west a package of measures aimed a solution to the dispute over iran 's atomic ambitions .
but will it really be anything new ? ahmadinejad announced the initiative in a televised speech in the southeast iranian province of kerman .
" we have prepared a package that can be the basis to resolve iran 's nuclear problem , " the iranian president said .
" it will be offered to the west soon . "
ahmadinejad , who is up for reelection this summer , did not give much in the way of specifics about what would be proposed or how the new initiative would deviate from previous ones .
" this new package will ensure peace and justice for the world , " he said .
" it respects the rights of all nations . "
ahmadinejad 's announcement comes after the us , russia , china , france , germany and england said last week that they would ask eu foreign policy chief javier solana to invite iran to a meeting to find " a diplomatic solution " to the issue .
in particular , us president barack obama is widely considered to be far more willing to negotiate with tehran over the nuclear issue than his predecessor george w. bush was .
continued unease bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most iranians support the nuclear program but want better relations with the west but first reactions to the announcement were cautious .
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry told afp news agency that his country would insist that tehran suspend all uranium enrichment activities for the duration of any talks with the international community .
the us said it was willing to consider new proposals .
" if they come up with some new package with regard to their nuclear program , we 'll have to take a look and see what it is , " u.s. state department spokesman robert wood told reporters .
previous initiatives put forward by iran have had little resonance in the west because tehran has insisted upon its right to enrich uranium - a procedure that can be used in the creation of atomic weapons - and tried to link the impasse over its nuclear program to broader issues in the middle east , including the israeli-palestinian conflict .
iran , the world 's fourth-largest producer of oil , insists that its nuclear activities are designed to enable the generation of atomic energy , not to facilitate building weapons . jc / jen afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

diffusers are aerodynamic features which channel air out of the back of the chassis . this affects a formula one car 's downforce which in turn enhances speed and performance .
the outcome of the fia inquiry could have major repercussions .
if the protestors win their case , then the fia could scrap the points won in australia and malaysia by the brawn gp , toyota and williams teams .
brawn gp has had a sensational start to its debut formula one season , winning both the australian and malaysian races .
the team leads the constructors ' championship with 25 points .
toyota is next with 16.5 points .
tough options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teams say unclear rules means it 's not a level playing field this season if the fia , however , rules that the diffusers are legal , then seven teams , including ferrari , red bull , renault , mclaren mercedes and bmw sauber will have to redevelop their cars at a huge cost as soon as possible .
the fia could also allow the results to stand and simply order the changes from this weekend 's chinese grand prix .
" diffusers increase a car 's performance by half a second per lap , " said bmw pilot , nick heidfeld from germany .
the bmw team said that they , too , had thought of using the new diffusers .
" for us , it was clear , however , that this was not allowed , " said bmw 's technical coordinator , willi rampf .
" you ca n't miss the dominance of teams who are using the new designs .
the fia must make a clear decision as quickly as possible .
sport is only interesting if everyone plays by the same rules . "
mclaren mercedes , anticipating a possible defeat for the challenging teams , has already begun work on developing a new diffuser for its team in an effort to stay competitive for the current season .
" but it 's like running a 100 meter race with a ten meter headstart by the competition , " said mercedes ' head of sports , norbert haug . wl / jen / nk , dpa / sid send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us authorities are to review whether the 89-year-old is too ill to be extradited to germany . a us federal appeals court has for the time being halted the deportation of the alleged nazi war criminal john demjanjuk .
the ruling came hours after us agents took demjanjuk from his ohio home to deport him to germany .
he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .

however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .

"
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .

he has meanwhile been released from federal custody and allowed to return home with an electronic tracking bracelet around his ankle , the us immigration and customs enforcement said .
frail demjanjuk two judges from the federal appeals court in cincinnati had ordered the deportation be stopped while it weighed whether demjanjuk deserved another hearing and prosecutors ' response that the legal case was at an end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demjanjuk 's attorneys say he is too ill to be deported demjanjuk 's son had petitioned the court to consider whether deporting his 89-year-old father to germany amounted to torture , because of his frail health .
german lawyer ulrich busch argued wednesday that demjanjuk was unfit to face trial because he needed chemotherapy for a kidney tumor .
" it 's either chemotherapy or a trial , " he said .
he had been scheduled to be flown immediately to munich , where he faces charges in the deaths of 29,000 jews .
prosecutors in germany accuse him of being an accessory in 1943 killings at sobibor death camp , where he is alleged to have personally led jews to the gas chambers at the camp in polish territory then occupied by nazi germany .
the german government said wednesday it was hopeful of a swift decision on the fate of demjanjuk .
a spokesman for the german justice ministry said authorities were prepared for an imminent decision , but conceded they had “ no updated information ” over the internal us deportation process .
german officials would become involved from the minute demjanjuk sets foot on german soil , the spokesperson added .
a case of identity the retired auto industry worker has denied any role in the holocaust .
he said he was drafted into the russian army in 1941 , became a german prisoner of war a year later and served at german prison camps until 1944 .
however , former wartime inmates of nazi camps in occupied poland identified demjanjuk - who changed his name from ivan when he emigrated to the united states in 1952 - as the notorious ukrainian prison guard " ivan the terrible " during a 1977 us justice department investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demjanjuk case has been played out on three continents since the end of world war ii demjanjuk was sentenced to death by a court in israel in 1988 , but his conviction was overturned five years later by israel 's supreme court after statements from other former guards identified another man as the sadistic " ivan . "
he was returned to the united states despite objections from holocaust survivors and jewish groups who said he should be retried based on the evidence that he was a guard at several camps .
demjanjuk regained his us citizenship , which was first stripped in 1981 , after an appeals court ruled in 1998 the government withheld exculpatory evidence .
the us government filed new charges a year later using fresh evidence that surfaced following the collapse of the soviet union .
demjanjuk was again stripped of his us citizenship in 2002 but remained in ohio long after his appeals of that decision were exhausted because the united states could not find a country willing to accept the now-stateless alleged war criminal .
the latest legal battle has dragged on for more than a month since germany issued a warrant for demjanjuk 's arrest on march 11 . sje / nk , afp / dpa / reuters / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .

poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .

its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 15.04.2009 swiss bank ubs to slash over 8,000 jobs as losses mount großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs : trouble , writ large after struggling to recover from losing billions in the economic crisis , switzerland 's biggest bank , ubs , on wednesday said it would slash 8,700 jobs in a bid to " make substantial cost savings " amid fresh losses . the bank , seeking to " realize substantial cost savings in all areas " after posting losses for the first quarter of about two billion swiss francs -lrb- 1.32 billion euros , $ 1.75 billion -rrb- , revealed that its latest job cull would help it trim costs by up to four billion francs .
" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" major job cuts are unfortunately unavoidable .
ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ubs expects to reduce the number of its employees to about 67,500 in 2010 , " said the bank , which employed 76,200 people at the end of march but which has slashed some 11,000 since october 2007 .
even as the bank downsizes , the bank 's new chief executive , oswald gruebel , warned that ubs was not out of the woods .
" but you should not assume that this will bring about a marked improvement in our results as early as the next few quarters .
our outlook remains cautious and we face many uncertainties , " he is expected to say in a speech to be delivered to shareholders during the bank 's annual general meeting -lrb- agm -rrb- later on wednesday .
the bank said it has yet to stem an outflow of funds , as its net money outflow for the wealth management and swiss bank division reached some 23 billion swiss francs .
" the outflow was mainly recorded after the announcement of the agreement in connection with the investigation into our cross-border activities for us clients , " said gruebel .
ubs still embroiled in damaging us tax case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss bank is still under a dark tax cloud in the us one of the biggest challenges faced by ubs is in the united states , where the bank still faces a us government lawsuit to recover the details of some 52,000 us customers suspected of tax offences .
the bank was forced to pay $ 780 million to us justice authorities in february to settle other charges of assisting tax fraud .
gruebel acknowledged recent attempts by countries including the us , germany and france to clamp down on tax cheats , and said ubs was " under particularly close scrutiny in this regard . "
" the operating conditions for cross-border wealth management will change , and this will affect how our clients act .
we shall make sure that this does not catch us unprepared , " he said .
another problem facing the bank was the " extreme " pressure on high executive pay , according to the bank 's nominated chairman kaspar villiger .
pressure on salaries blunting competitive edge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to paying for the best , ubs finds the coffers empty ubs was starting to lose out in recruiting the best as it trims costs , villiger said in a draft of the speech he plans to deliver at wednesday 's agm , during which his nomination is expected to be approved by shareholders .
salaries at ubs have " fallen more than the competition 's , " he said .
" but we 're seeing increasing evidence that we 're starting to lose our competitive edge with regard to recruiting the best of the best .
this should be a message to those who think the bank should take more extreme measures , " he added .
public anger has mounted over bonuses paid to executives at failing firms , in particular companies that have had to be bailed out by the state .
ubs received a multi-billion-dollar state support package late last year - the only swiss bank to need public aid .
villiger , a former swiss finance minister , said that " excessive salaries have angered me as well " and needed to come down to a " normal level . "
but he argued that the bank operates in a " real environment " and needs the best people to tackle problems .
" if taxpayers want their money back , or even to make a profit on their investments , it is more important to have top-quality management than rock-bottom salaries , " he said . nda / ncy , afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if nature was a business what would it say ? german agriculture minister isle aigner announced a ban on the cultivation of us biotech giant monsanto 's genetically modified corn strain mon 810 on tuesday after considering a number of studies .
monsanto 's seed was due to be planted on 3,600 hectares -lrb- 9,000 acres -rrb- of german farm land this year , predominantly in the east of the country .
the mon 810 strain is the only genetically modified crop approved in the european union .
some german media commentators say the agriculture minister 's environmental concerns were well founded , but others have questioned her motives .
" as long as there are any doubts , germany should follow the example of other eu countries and prevent the cultivation of gm corn - or at least impose a moratorium , " writes the sueddeutsche zeitung from munich .
" but that would have to happen quickly , before new seeds are planted .
the decision will always be controversial , but it would be embarrassing if the governing coalition avoided acting until after the next election . "
" a minister has no choice ; one has to make a decision that is both politically acceptable and realistic , " says the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" agriculture minister aigner has made her decision on the gm corn issue and has banned its cultivation with immediate effect and on a continuing basis .
her reasons may be numerous .
one of them is fears based on observations that mon 810 is more damaging to the environment than its advocates suggest .
the fact that only water fleas and butterflies have so far been harmed does not refute warnings of unforeseeable consequences .
who knows how many humans will soon have to endure the same fate as those small creatures ? "
" aigner has to decide now if she wants to ban mon 810 from german fields , " writes the berliner zeitung .
" the damage that genetically modified crops can cause to the animal and plant worlds - from mutation to reduced biodiversity - is not foreseeable .
if nature were a business like monsanto , with press spokespeople and bags of money for good lawyers , then it would have won the genetic modification case long ago , and it would n't be governments who were worried about claims for compensation , but rather seed producers .
aigner should turn herself into a lawyer for nature and ban gm corn in germany - even if within her -lsb- bavarian -rsb- csu party there is more consideration of election tactics than there is ecological conviction . "
" the first thoroughly bavarian political reason -lsb- for aigner 's decision -rsb- : the farmers in bavaria oppose genetically modified corn , and so does the csu , " comments the financial times deutschland .
" if aigner had allowed the cultivation of gm corn , it probably would have cost her votes at the european parliamentary elections in june , and probably in the german federal election too .
the csu 's popularity among voters is not so great that she could have allowed gm corn .
the second reason is more substantial : there is a deep mistrust of genetic modification .
germans are prepared to accept every artificial flavor , every preservative or any other dubious ingredient in food - but when it 's a question of genetic modification , they want nothing to do with it . "
" fear has won again - or to be more precise , the csu 's fear in the lead up to the european elections , " writes die welt .
" for years a green-conservative splinter group , the ecological democratic party , has been the fear-monger in villages in bavaria , spreading rumors and false allegations about genetic engineering .
because nobody took a stand against them , an active movement has developed , based on unsettled farmers and city eco-esoterics , who have made the csu scared . … queasy feelings are dictating politics .

" jeers from the fans hurt , " said klinsmann .
" you must present a trophy on the marienplatz -lrb- the munich square where the club traditionally celebrates titles -rrb- . "
" of course such a situation is not comfortable , " the coach said after the match .
" but i understand that after the 4-0 in the first leg people are angry . "
bayern rank second in the bundesliga , three points behind leaders vfl wolfsburg .
with seven matches remaining , klinsmann said every game was now a final for last year 's champions .
" we have to get points , points , points , " klinsmann told reporters .
" we have to get maximum points and i still believe we will win the championship . "
escalating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg walked all over bayern at the volkswagon arena but bayern 's defeat to barca is not the only factor behind the ramped up pressure on klinsmann .
eleven days ago the bavarians suffered a 5-1 loss to wolfsburg in the bundesliga , a result that followed their dismantling by bayer leverkusen in the german cup in march .
the lagging form has added to speculation that even if klinsmann brings home a national league trophy he could still be axed .
but club president franz beckenbauer , who has not been one of klinsmann 's most ardent supporters , tried to take some pressure off his coach .
" i would not be angry if we did not win the bundesliga after this year of confusion , " beckenbauer said after the barcelona match .
" but we need the champions league -lrb- qualification spot -rrb- . "
new stars needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern conceded they need more stars in addition to franck ribery in europe , bayern 's deficits were brutally exposed by barca last week when the catalans won the first leg 4-0 .
tuesday 's game ended 1-1 as bayern failed once again to make the final four in europe 's top tournament since winning the trophy in 2001 .
bayern 's failure to push on in europe this year underlined that the club 's reliance on french star franck ribery would not bring it any trophies beyond the bundesliga , and that the club needed to bolster its attacking and defensive ranks .
" we know in which areas we must improve when we start again in the champions league next year ...
we definitely need two or three top players .
we are working on that , " said klinsmann .

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .
by comparison , germany had an almost balanced budget in 2008 . gb / jen , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the economic gloom spreads in germany , slumping exports - a pillar of the country 's economy - have been dragging down growth , making reliable forecasts next to impossible . europe 's largest economy is poised to shrink nearly five percent this year , says the german institute for economic research , the diw . the downward spiral is essentially due to a 12.9 percent slump in exports , the institute says . the latest diw report underscores how the recession has deepened in germany in recent months and follows a series of forecast revisions made by other economic research institutes .
just four months ago , economists were predicting that the economy would contract by only 1.1 percent . figures ' not meaningful ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the current economic climate , luxury is not an option for most people the rapid deterioration of the economic outlook has prompted the diw to take the unprecedented step of not issuing a growth projection for 2010 .
diw president klaus zimmermann said world trade was hemorrhaging , making forecasts next to impossible . " even in normal times , " zimmermann said , " it 's difficult to make predictions about the following year .
and , in light of the hard-to-estimate effects of the worldwide economic stimulus programs , we think the current figures are not really meaningful . " the diw also says it expects investment in equipment and machinery in germany to fall by nearly 15 percent this year . the scale of the downturn means that germany will likely breach the key three-percent budget rule for euro member states and report a budget deficit of about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's public deficit in 2009 is expected to climb by more than 20 billion euros although the diw expects the worst of the recession to be over by early next year , any recovery , it says , will be weak and slow .
zimmermann also forecasts a significant jump in unemployment for 2009 . " the market is still protected by the fact that many companies are not laying off workers and putting them on short work weeks instead , " he said .
" even so , we ’ re going to see at least 700,000 more unemployed this year . " that figure would bring the number of jobless in germany to 3.7 million . but , there is hope , the institute says .
the downward trend should bottom out in the first quarter of next year due to worldwide economic stimulus measures , low commodity prices and the resulting drop in inflation . the diw warns , however , that the sharp economic slump and expensive stimulus packages are hitting national debt levels . the institute expects german public deficit to climb well above 100 billion euros -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- in 2010 after topping out at 80 billion this year .

" this will increase the reserves of the polish central bank by one third ... to immunize poland against the virus of the crisis and the attacks of speculators , " rostowski said .
" this is n't emergency funding , " he insisted .
" i can say that during talks with the imf it was clear that poland is considered a pillar of stability in the region " and that the imf aimed to reinforce that role , he added .
" this in an instrument , thanks to which we are getting priceless insurance policy in the time of a global uncertainty , " deputy finance minister ludwik kotecki told reuters .
the european union 's largest ex-communist member , poland is in better shape than the region 's other emerging economies , such as hungary , latvia and romania - all of which have received outside funds .
it has previously been reluctant to flag any need for additional funding , even though it suffered from an evaporation of capital due to the credit crunch and worries over the region 's growth and financing .
imf chief has no problems with poland 's request bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stauss-kahn said poland had a solid financial record imf head dominique strauss-kahn welcomed poland 's move , noting its " economic fundamentals and policy framework are strong , and the polish authorities have demonstrated a commitment to maintaining this solid record . "
strauss-kahn said he expected the fund to move quickly with an approval .
deputy finance minister kotecki said poland may get the credit line as soon as next week .
poland followed the lead of mexico , which announced on march 31 that it would activate an fcl worth up to $ 40 billion .
the fcl is the result of a reform announced march 24 by the imf .
in a sharp break with past practices , the global lender unveiled the new instrument designed for countries deemed as having " very strong fundamentals , policies , and track records of policy implementation . "
the credit line has no conditions , no limit on the amount of money that can be borrowed , can be drawn on at any time , and can be used to confront a crisis or as a " precautionary instrument " to prevent one .
under the terms of the fcl , the credit line initially can be for six months , or 12 months with a review of eligibility at the six-month mark .
its repayment period extends to between three years and three months , to five years .
a loan for poland is a loan for stability , say analysts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland is a stable nation in a region of financial instability poland is a rarity because it expects economic growth this year .
warsaw has been battling to dissociate itself from the grim regional picture in other eastern european states that are facing some of the sharpest recessions in the eu .
" polish fundamentals stand out relative to regional peers , " said manik narain , an analyst at standard chartered , in a statement .
independent polish analyst marek zuber told afp that " if one bolsters poland , one bolsters the whole region . "
" a loan to poland is n't a loan to one country ...
it 's about boosting the strongest link , " he added .
the economy of this country of 38 million people has been in robust health over recent years , notably since the ex-communist state joined the european union in 2004 .
in 2007 it grew 6.7 percent .
in 2008 the rate was a still-credible 4.8 percent .
polish authorities forecast growth of between 0.3 percent and 1.9 percent this year while the european commission , the 27-nation eu 's executive body , is expecting around 2.0 percent .
keeping the zloty afloat despite the relatively rosy outlook , poland 's currency , the zloty , has found itself under attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles and the zloty took a battering earlier this year in mid-february it plunged to a five-year low point of 4.92 to the euro - marking a 40-percent fall since july 2008 and making it the world 's most beleaguered currency despite the recession-bucking forecasts .
at the time , warsaw announced it was prepared to intervene if the zloty fell to 5.0 to the euro - and the government subsequently made what it called a " routine " sale of euros from its coffers , pulling the rate back to 4.68 , and it has since climbed further .
poland 's government has some 150 billion zlotys -lrb- currently 35 billion euros , $ 46 billion -rrb- of debt to refinance in 2009 and some analysts had earlier voiced fears the credit crunch may put strong upward pressure on the yields offered by the country of 38 million . nda / ncy , ap / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new reserve bank governor sada reddy made the announcement soon after he was installed by the military-led government .
his predecessor , savenaca narube , was dismissed on tuesday and is reported to have been detained .
military chief frank bainimarama has strengthened his grip and blocked radio broadcasts since a court ruled last week that his rule was illegal .
fiji 's central bank also announced the introduction of exchange controls to prevent capital flight .
it said the devaluation would help boost fijian tourism and exports - both badly hit by the political crisis and global economic downturn .
new zealand foreign minister murray mccully said the fiji economy was in serious strife even before the last week 's upheaval and the military did not understand the role of the central bank .
australian foreign minister stephen smith described fiji as " now effectively a self-imposed military dictatorship " .
the australian broadcasting corporation reported that its transmitters in fiji have been disabled to prevent local broadcasts , but said its short-wave service continued .
the pacific islands news association has called on the government " to immediately remove its security force presence in newsrooms and to stop its censoring of news items " .
free speech ' trouble ' in an interview with radio new zealand , mr bainimarama said he was determined to carry out what he described as reforms .
he defended the introduction of emergency regulations that include an edict that the local fijian media publishes only positive news , saying fiji does not need free and open public discussion about current issues .
" that was how we ended up with what we came up with in the last couple of days , " he told radio new zealand .
" the circumstances have changed .
we -lsb- the government -rsb- now decide what needs to be done for our country , for the reforms that need to be put in place for us to have a better fiji , " he said .
fiji 's court of appeal ruled last thursday that the bainimarama regime , in power since staging a 2006 coup , was illegal under the country 's 1997 constitution .
in response , the country 's ailing president josefa iloilo sacked the judges , dissolved the constitution and reappointed mr bainimarama , who then said there would be no democratic elections until 2014 .

the new reserve bank governor sada reddy made the announcement soon after he was installed by the military-led government .
his predecessor , savenaca narube , was dismissed on tuesday and is reported to have been detained .
military chief frank bainimarama has strengthened his grip and blocked radio broadcasts since a court ruled last week that his rule was illegal .
fiji 's central bank also announced the introduction of exchange controls to prevent capital flight .
it said the devaluation would help boost fijian tourism and exports - both badly hit by the political crisis and global economic downturn .
new zealand foreign minister murray mccully said the fiji economy was in serious strife even before the last week 's upheaval and the military did not understand the role of the central bank .
australian foreign minister stephen smith described fiji as " now effectively a self-imposed military dictatorship " .
the australian broadcasting corporation reported that its transmitters in fiji have been disabled to prevent local broadcasts , but said its short-wave service continued .
the pacific islands news association has called on the government " to immediately remove its security force presence in newsrooms and to stop its censoring of news items " .
free speech ' trouble ' in an interview with radio new zealand , mr bainimarama said he was determined to carry out what he described as reforms .
he defended the introduction of emergency regulations that include an edict that the local fijian media publishes only positive news , saying fiji does not need free and open public discussion about current issues .
" that was how we ended up with what we came up with in the last couple of days , " he told radio new zealand .
" the circumstances have changed .
we -lsb- the government -rsb- now decide what needs to be done for our country , for the reforms that need to be put in place for us to have a better fiji , " he said .
fiji 's court of appeal ruled last thursday that the bainimarama regime , in power since staging a 2006 coup , was illegal under the country 's 1997 constitution .
in response , the country 's ailing president josefa iloilo sacked the judges , dissolved the constitution and reappointed mr bainimarama , who then said there would be no democratic elections until 2014 .
